Although there are a few isolated reports in the literature suggesting that sugar beet pollen is highly antigenic, hypersensitivity to components of sugar beet is not a common disease.	0.5961754460087476
We report a 29-year-old man with a history of atopic dermatitis who developed both contact dermatitis and allergic rhinitis from sugar beet pollen through his job in a seed nursery.	0.5805410157325059
Establishing nursing science at German universities has become more and more consolidated.	0.40182469887744815
At the beginning of this establishment there was an evident backlog especially compared to angloamerican and scandinavian countries.	0.4987062030900913
Today - 1997 - more than 40 nursing science courses exist at German high schools and universities.	0.5388542966441543
Active glucocorticoids (GCS), such as cortisol or corticosterone, are a prerequisite for the induction of surfactant synthesis in the fetal lung.	0.572216483039696
In fetal serum, biologically inactive metabolites (cortisone or 11-dehydrocorticosterone) outweigh the active forms.	0.31555481960603765
In this study we demonstrate with organoid cultures of fetal rat lungs that the reductive side of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD) regulates the intracellular activation of GCS.	0.6106694175654013
The inhibition of 11-HSD by the licorice extract glycyrrhetinic acid completely inhibits this central metabolism.	0.3854290769134276
On the other hand, GCS induce the reductive activity of 11-HSD and, therefore, they increase their own activation by positive feedback.	0.4947669822552844
In a community sample of 394 eldery aged 61 years and older from East and West Germany, diseases, contacts with general practitioners and specialists, the use of medicine, attitudes regarding health and illness, the subjective health, psychic problems, social support, social integration, social burden, and socio-demographic variables were assessed.	0.6680570918762059
Based on these data the determinants for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine were analyzed.	0.532230467717715
The results confirmed the frequency of multimorbidity in the elderly; on average we found three different diseases at the same time for each person.	0.6937863761198516
In nearly 10% of the sample we found seven diagnoses existing at the same time.	0.5774218685165159
88% had contact with a general practitioner at least once a year, 97% had contact either with a general practitioner or with a specialist once a year.	0.7773276676414798
55.8% took at least one medicine each day.	0.4979395253007841
The number of diseases existing at the same time was the most determining variable for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine.	0.5796826230626082
Furthermore, the elderly had more contact with physicians and took more medicine if they thought they were susceptible to diseases in a high degree, and if they rated their own health as poor.	0.6800922634566219
Fewer contacts with physicians and a lower use of medicine were found in those elderly that rated health behavior as little useful, that had low control beliefs regarding their own health, and that experienced only a low degree of health-related limitations in their everyday life.	0.6966228142281364
Furthermore, we found a higher use of medicine if there was little social support.	0.7927327804810708
There were no significant age-related or sex-related differences regarding the contact of practitioners or the use of medicine.	0.6971687148507655
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) are chronic inflammatory and frequently relapsing diseases of the gut that ultimately lead to destruction of the intestinal tissue.	0.5706098429473246
Recent evidence suggests that a pathologic activation of the mucosal immune system in response to antigens is a key factor in the pathogenesis of IBD.	0.6077947216126943
Furthermore, changes in cell migration and cytokine production appear to contribute to the perpetuation of IBD and the postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease.	0.5103236270588428
Based on recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD, several new therapeutic strategies are currently being tested in clinical practice, including recombinant anti-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-, IL-10, IL-11) and inhibitors of cell adhesion molecules (ICAM), proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-12) and their receptors (TNF, IL-6R).	0.7017976054744731
Dysregulation of apoptosis may play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).	0.4444929203278734
A defective clearance of apoptotic cells or inappropriately high rates of apoptosis may lead to a pathologic accumulation of abnormal cell material with a secondary autoimmune response.	0.476216592081936
Experimental findings in apoptotic keratinocytes and C1q knock-out mice suggest an important role of C1q in the clearance of apoptotic cell material.	0.4999367602643505
In addition, there are several links between C1q and SLE: Most the patients with C1q deficiency develop a SLE-like syndrome.	0.6358434850712862
SLE itself often causes secondary C1q deficiency and autoantibodies to C1q are detected in almost all patients with active lupus nephritis.	0.5341219030516636
These observations suggest a central role of C1q in apoptosis and in the pathogenesis of SLE.	0.6017115346235988
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the causes and accident mechanisms that lead to injuries in infancy involving buggies and prams in order to establish strategies for accident prevention.	0.5368432911581907
The discussion about the implementation of telemedicine and teleresourcing and its consequences has been under way for some time now.	0.5217532664849368
The rate at which telemedical applications are being developed, leaves little time for consideration of the economic, scientific and social aspects.	0.5541564723238431
There is a need for integration of all the existing fragments into one coherent telemedical concept.	0.5013968409942803
Different aspects of telemedical concepts are discussed.	0.2453114811454504
A 34-year-old woman who was separated from her husband, was killed by him by strangulation and several stab wounds in the chest.	0.5487045122028971
The post-mortem examination was carried out approximately 5 h after death.	0.4930987019848535
At the place of discovery one swab of her right and one of her left neck side were taken.	0.4067737480634748
Additionally, a swab was taken out from the front side of the collar of her polo-neck pullover.	0.5529275185970342
It was obvious that the skin of the neck below the larynx showed a fabric pattern leading to the assumption that the collar was temporarily pressed between the hands of the suspect and the neck of the victim.	0.6114401140283814
DNA typing (short tandem repeat-PCR) of these swabs led to the detection of mixed patterns for the swabs of the neck and the collar which matched the patterns of the victim and the suspect.	0.7127866317273753
A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed to evaluate the use of self-reinforced absorbable composites (Biofix) in the fixation of ankle fractures.	0.840096243547528
The aim of this study was to demonstrate that fixation with Biofix rods and screws is as good as the standard A. O. fixation.	0.5972133028489794
The benefits of Biofix rods and screws are: a reduction in costs since no secondary operation is needed, prevention of stress-shielding and thereby diminishing the risk of bone porosity.	0.5949961646277351
Patients aged between 16 and 75 years old with closed, non-comminuted fractures of the lateral and/or medial malleolus and dislocation of the fracture fragments greater thean 2 mm were included in the study.	0.6532765407837793
22 patients were treated with Biofix rods and screws and the control group of 19 patients with a standard technique.	0.8586279869483368
After 3, 6 and 12 months, rontgenograms were taken.	0.6607836386259314
At the same time functional results were evaluated following the criteria of Olerud and Molander.	0.6689946365020737
Two patients were withdrawn from the trial for non-medical reasons.	0.5959532852383173
22 patients (12 from the Biofix group, 10 from the AO group) operated two or more years ago were contacted to see if any complications had occured since they were last seen.	0.5777848088333963
In 4 cases a Biofix screw broke down just beneath the head during insertion.	0.3934497019767458
This did not result in an insufficient fixation of the fracture.	0.6715867392037267
There were no early post-operative complications.	0.6503241271184463
The functional and rontgenological results in both groups were equal.	0.701737099491496
In three cases a sterile sinus developed at the site of screw insertion.	0.506804635121994
Biofix rods and screws, made of polylactic acid, are a good alternative for the fixation of fractures of the ankle.	0.8441430381222699
The use of resorbable fracture fixation material has the advantage that a second operation to remove osteosynthesis material is not necessary.	0.5647882522556515
The long term results are good.	0.7222035173760817
There is, however, a possibility of development of tissue reaction to the resorbable material.	0.593474628232373
In current textbooks of dermatology, lichen amyloidosus is said to be a papular, intensely pruritic type of amyloidosis of unknown aetiology.	0.5466424874738937
When this concept was developed, there was no way of discriminating between the different types of amyloid.	0.6215719296716526
It is now known that amyloid in lichen amyloidosus is not derived from immunoglobulins or serum proteins, as it is in systemic amyloidoses, but from keratin peptides of necrotic keratinocytes.	0.6515272796962285
Even several years ago, chronic scratching was invoked as a possible cause of damage to keratinocytes in lichen amyloidosus.	0.49730942164744724
In support of this hypothesis, four cases are presented.	0.5583745100064482
Apart from amyloid in the papillary layer, all biopsy specimens revealed histopathological signs of chronic scratching (epithelial hyperplasia with hypergranulosis and compact orthokeratosis, coarse collagen in vertical streaks in the stratum papillare), such as are also found in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus.	0.43521818120978056
Lichen amyloidosus is considered to be a variant of these conditions.	0.7018316150157388
Just as in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus, pruritus seems to be the cause and not a symptom of the papular skin lesions.	0.5845334773803914
Consequently, treatment of lichen amyloidosus should not be directed at removing amyloid, but at improving the pruritus.	0.6910931604611394
Ulcers in chronic venous insufficiency, especially in postthrombotic syndrome, are often resistant to compression therapy.	0.7210817815635294
They can be treated effectively by the dermatologic surgeon with a fairly simple operative procedure.	0.520653403094339
The removal of the ulcer together with the extensive lipodermatosclerosis by Humby knife (shave-therapy) and immediate grafting with a meshed split skin graft - possibly in combination with ligation of insufficient perforator veins - yields very good success rates.	0.5516535133950389
The results in 13 patients (18 legs) with an average follow up period of 11 months (up to 20 months) are reported.	1.1531056445470018
The literature from 1990-1997 and 3 personal cases are reviewed to give an update on findings and current therapy for adder bites.	0.5190683741661424
Bites of the adder (Vipera berus) are rare.	0.49231183970956643
Symptomatic treatment usually leads to complete restitution, death due to adder bite is rare.	0.3222582523155265
The main venom effect is the development of - sometimes severe - edema, hemolysis and disseminated coagulopathy, very occasionally followed by lethal renal failure.	0.6160093095434196
Significant intoxication is very unlikely if 2-3 h after the incident, no signs of intoxication can be found.	0.6418611024244499
Background: The use of high-tech communication is undoubtedly growing and has become established in almost all sciences and research fields.	0.5410688762961108
This article surveys the possibilities for scientific data-exchange via the Internet, the world's largest computer network.	0.5348479809395977
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are known to exhibit far less cardiac side effects than tricyclic antidepressants.	0.5062125290234116
We report three cases in which the SSRI, paroxetine, induced clinically relevant ECG changes in patients with high risk profile.	0.6587609948443054
In two cases an increase in QTc time was observed, severe bradycardia was also observed twice.	0.6603077845459154
Objective: Cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is not very helpful in the management of patients with whooping cough, since culture takes three to five days until results are available, and only about 30-60% of patients may be detected by this method.	0.7669813949208197
In order to improve the laboratory diagnosis of whooping cough, different protocols for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were developed.	0.637942752472504
With the introduction of each new technique for registering eye movements, the question arises concerning whether these provide a reliable and accurate alternative for the  diagnosis of labyrinthine dysfunction when compared to the most commonly used electro-oculographic technique.	0.696415867093366
To answer this question we compared mean slow-phase velocity (SPV) using three different recording techniques: electro-oculography (EOG), video-oculography (VOG) and infra-red oculography (IROG) during four different types of examinations.	0.5280414201946542
The examinations were the eye target tracking test (ETT), horizontal and vertical optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) tests and the rotating chair test of the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (HVOR).	0.4117250085423233
For the ETT tests the VOG provided consistently higher mean SPV values with low variance, presumably because of the accuracy and stability of the calibration.	0.51276215502446
For the horizontal OKN and VOR rotating chair tests no significant differences were found between the mean SPV obtained with the different recording techniques, although the IROG recordings were associated with a larger variance.	0.70452400887625
Vertical OKN mean SPV was consistently lower with IROG and VOG techniques presumably because of non-linearities and resolution limitations inherent in these techniques.	0.3574403337196917
These results indicate that the EOG technique despite its disadvantages of noise, time to apply and variability of calibration still provides an inexpensive, reliable and accurate means of measuring slow-phase eye movements.	0.5741341670189888
Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the plasma levels of the circulating adhesion molecules sICAM-1 and sE-selectin could serve as early predictors of developing sepsis and its severity.	0.6269919968539396
Problem: The data model given in the  DICOM standard is examined unter the aspect of system integration.	0.6270378845367174
Semantic properties of the IODs (information object definitions) and their relationships are investigated.	0.6439230032239666
Thoracic disc herniation is rare.	0.1656025363438959
Pain is the most common initial symptom, followed by sensory disturbances and motor involvement.	0.6851118046214932
By the time of diagnosis, 90% of the patient have signs of spinal cord compression.	0.8780483686914735
A 42-year-old woman was operated on because of shoulder pain.	0.6359773291041043
During her stay in hospital, the patient first demonstrated uncharacteristic pain and after 2weeks an incomplete paraplegia caused by herniation of the T10/11 disc.	0.5355734114584488
Degenerative changes have been considered to be a cause for spontaneous quadriceps tendon rupture.	0.6205377591573289
Aim of this study is to investigate the microvasculature of the quadriceps tendon by injection techniques and immunohistochemical methods (antibodies against laminin) with regard to the pathogenesis of tendon degeneration.	0.720156570081721
The blood supply of the quadriceps tendon arises from descending branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery, by branches of the descending geniculate artery and by branches of the medial and lateral superior geniculate arteries.	0.6798652594892141
Blood vessels penetrate the tendon from the surrounding connective tissue and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network.	0.3757999239376741
Compared to the surrounding synovial layer, the amount of vessels in the tendon substance is greatly reduced.	0.6000028009660945
The distribution of blood vessels within the quadriceps tendon is not homogenous.	0.5534824673509503
The anterior or superficial part of the tendon has a complete vascular network that extends from the musculo-tendinous junction to the patella.	0.49650446811976245
Within the deep portion of the quadriceps tendon there is an oval shaped avascular area which measures app.	0.48390570110058345
30 mm in length and app.	0.29447668730081933
Within this area the immunohistochemical proof of laminin is negative.	0.3522662067359856
An explanation for the absence of blood vessels may be compressive stress caused by the patellar groove which serves as hypomochlion for the quadriceps tendon when the knee is flexed.	0.47770899070712686
The occurrence of an avascular zone within the deep layer of the tendon that is directed to the joint cavity may explain the frequency of degenerative changes in this region.	0.60129074390572
When looking for the possible cause of distortions in values measured for the determination of breath ethanol concentration (BEC) in artificially respirated patients, consideration must be given to the humidity and temperature of the gas examined.	0.5865002404322076
In the present study, the effects of humidified and warmed and of dry and cold air on the accuracy of a newly developed BEC measuring device, as compared to a reference model and to a conventional system, were examined in a lung model.	0.7916930599999733
Total or partial relapses after conventional surgical advancement of the maxilla following Le Fort I osteotomy in CLP patients are frequent and major complications.	0.4919410692925233
The aim of this investigation was to find out whether the technique of distraction osteogenesis in these patients shows more stability and whether maxillary distraction is able to replace conventional advancement.	0.6629172412693612
Maxillary distraction was performed in 12 patients.	0.7143937849487945
In two cases, a Delaire mask was used to bring the maxilla forward, ten patients were treated with the extraoral distraction device designed by Polley.	0.6742319129468657
In all patients, planned advancement of the maxilla could be achieved; one partial relapse occurred.	0.6469984977346943
The results indicate that distraction osteogenesis offers the possibility of advancement of the maxilla with the required stability.	0.556627811403259
The technique presents a major improvement which is achieved with a relatively minor surgical procedure.	0.48027284533799
We report a rare case of primary primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the bladder in an adult.	0.6524309332244104
A huge tumour with extensions into pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue was found radiologically in a 62-year-old man.	0.4936989309299969
The patient did not complain about remarkable clinical symptoms until 4 days before admission to hospital.	0.3810289641873603
Histology of diagnostic transurethral tumour resection showed a small round-cell tumour with focal necrosis and scattered Homer-Wright rosettes.	0.38056946783450507
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that tumour cells stained positively with O13, a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the membrane glycoprotein p30/32MIC2.	0.45911286973580884
Focally, tumour cells stained positively for vimentin, NSE, S-100 protein and synaptophysin.	0.5155998904197693
The patient died 3 weeks later because of fulminant pulmonary embolism and autopsy revealed a huge, partly exophytic but mainly endophytic tumour of the bladder with extensions into the rectum and retroperitoneal tissue.	0.6435077840831619
The differential diagnosis of small round-cell tumours in this location is discussed.	0.5419839954665163
Lesions of the acetabular labrum should be treated by correcting the causes.	0.7905606162947849
In a steep acetabulum where the femoral head brings the acetabular labrum under tension and traction, the acetabulum should be rotated by triple pelvic osteotomy to slightly overcorrected acetabular measurements.	0.48302829218700444
Severely diminished acetabular and femoral anteversion can also lead to tears and impingement of the labrum.	0.3840139653632088
Then rotation of the femoral neck and/or rotations of the acetabulum by triple osteotomy to 15-20  ° of anteversion are indicated.	0.7273679312993073
Our triple osteotomy technique differs from that of others mainly in the ischial osteotomy.	0.4202343290103926
It is performed from the posterior approach between the sciatic notch next to the ischial spine and the obturator foramen and is directed 20-30  ° anteriorly from the frontal (coronal) plane.	0.5309289322241335
The osteotomies therefore are placed close enough to the acetabulum to allow free rotation, but they do not interfere with the circulation of the acetabulum, and the ligaments between the sacrum and ischium are left in normal tension.	0.6345228281087602
Our normal values of the acetabular position were tested by correlating the measurements with the absence of pain.	0.5705951619897285
The optimum is reached with a CE angle and a VCA angle of 30-35  °, an angle of the weight-bearing zone of +5 to -5  ° and a migration index of 10-15 %.	0.6873124090895195
Overcorrections again caused pain and should be avoided.	0.3710374597614259
Diminished anteversion of femur and acetabulum towards 0  ° also caused pain and should be corrected by triple and femoral osteotomy to 15-20  ° of anteversion.	0.5508749061653722
In earlier follow-ups of 216 hips 5-10 years postoperatively, 82.3 % of the joints showed no change in the degree of osteoarthrosis.	0.7543658269009155
Survival rate curves regarding the absence of pain demonstrated that pain was experienced again when joints were corrected insufficiently or overcorrected, while in good corrections the joints were free of pain in about 75 %.	0.5850458483280956
Background: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is associated with point mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that appear to be pathogenic for this disease.	0.5097983579903658
These mutations affect nucleotide positions 3460, 11 778 and 14 484.	0.37978947865641777
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT type II) is an immunoglobulin-mediated, drug-induced side effect for heparin-treated patients with thromboembolic complications.	0.810291198623059
With an incidence of 1-3 %, mortality of 20 % it and permanent disability for another 20 % is a clinically relevant disorder.	0.7640062833939918
With heparin treatment or prophylaxis frequent platelet count monitoring is necessary.	0.3096581307386912
With HIT type II the thrombocytopenia is often a harbinger of thromboembolic complications in the venous or arterial system.	0.45472009538474867
If HIT type II is suspected, further heparin exposure is to be stopped immediately and another anticoagulant therapy should be started.	0.6664470963762067
The two anticoagulant options in Germany are discussed.	0.47764800663386037
At the same time the diagnosis should be confirmed by laboratory testing, including testing for cross-reactivity with danaparoid.	0.6834442017639
Further therapy depends on the symptoms.	0.34377923907578367
In the case of clinical relevance of this disorder we should think about prophylaxis: strict indications for perioperative prophylaxis only use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for routine prophylaxis, use of LMWH for thrombosis treatment and early change to cumarine.	0.5846402905123086
A patented low-temperature polymerization method for methylmethacrylate (MMA) infiltrated bone marrow biopsies is described: it has been developed from our previous MMA technique and is a patented procedure.	0.5887169700899384
Differences from the previous method are (1) removal of stabilizer from the MMA monomer before its application, (2) the use of a different starter, (3) avoidance of O2 influence during polymerization by means of vacuum exchange with N2, and (4) polymerisation in a water bath to draw off residual heat.	0.6321322389609012
After this procedure, all immunohistochemical reactions are possible provided that the previous fixation is adequate.	0.5694333395858305
The effects of different fixatives are reviewed briefly without detailed analysis.	0.4185035552993778
Technically, this plastic embedding can be performed at least as rapidly as the classic paraffin embedding after decalcification.	0.6636942241443192
The advantages over the latter method are: (1) the cells can be better differentiated because semi-thin sections can be made; (2) the immunoreactions can also be performed on the basis of semi-thin sections, which means they can be interpreted more easily; (3) morphometric analyses yield more reliable results because of the constant thickness of sections; (4) osteological examination of bone trabeculae, especially the search for mineralisation deficiencies, is possible; (5) the plastic embedding procedure is less dependent on individual instabilities in the quality of performance of the staff members involved.	0.7257060481756443
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the costs for additional equipment necessary remain below DM 100,000 including an excellent microtome.	0.4874559380144276
The routine use of succinylcholine for endotracheal intubation is being increasingly questioned.	0.5519515457518721
Initial studies have suggested that a combination of propofol and alfentanil without a muscle relaxant can provide good intubating conditions.	0.48468130796584685
However, most of these initial studies either did not have a double-blind design or did not include a control group with muscle relaxants.	0.7185266536341243
In this study, intubation conditions using fentanyl/propofol without a muscle relaxant were compared with the combinations of fentanyl/propofol/succinylcholine and sodium thiopental/succinylcholine.	0.5656512390883278
Nosocomial pneumonia is still a common problem, especially in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.	0.7822167143979631
The endotracheal tube contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of pneumonia in these patients, because it facilitates microaspiration and impairs host defense.	0.5560202494672237
Common nosocomial pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa are known to produce exopolysaccharides and generate a complex biofilm structure, which allows adhesion to abiotic surfaces and protection against antibiotic action.	0.49417052394852073
Multiple studies have identified bacterial biofilm on the inner lumen of endotracheal tubes, which represents a permanent source of infectious material.	0.5219642889866166
Endotracheal tubes, removed from patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, are covered more frequently with biofilm than those of uninfected controls.	0.5129537778245818
It remains unclear whether this represents a source of infection or contamination.	0.49142451268652904
Bacterial biofilm, however, may play an important role in recurrent pulmonary infections of the intubated and mechanically ventilated patient.	0.5055094343226819
Computer-guided robot-assisted surgery in cementless total hip replacement requires exact preoperative planning at the 3D workstation Orthodoc.	0.5241889913216612

This study provides evidence for effectiveness of retrograde ureteral Double-J stent placement as a therapeutic option in cases of severe symptomatic hydronephrosis during pregnancy with a low morbidity rate.	0.6404937621111108
Between 1981 and 1994 at the Bergmannsheil Ruhr University Hospital in Bochum, Germany, we treated 145 patients with femoral diaphyseal nonunions following initial operative treatment.	0.5370845911482245
Of these patients, 138 received this initial operative treatment at an outside institution.	0.5048610062491306
The primary reconstructions for the fractures utilized plates in 112 cases, reamed nails in 24 cases and external fixators in 9 cases.	0.4435095247431565
The average age of the patients was 35 years and the mean time from the initial operative treatment was 2 years.	0.9933718968068898
Twenty-seven patients (19 %) presented with a hypertrophic nonunion and 118 (81 %) with an atrophic nonunion.	0.7841056361139691
There was a significant correlation between primary "classic" plating and development of an atrophic nonunion (2-test: P < 0.01).	0.6781726696831691
We observed 34 wound infections (23 %) with no significant correlation to the type of primary osteosynthesis.	0.8443264246325128
We determined that 73 of the pseudarthroses were due to improper osteosynthesis techniques.	0.2843035732309472
Of these cases, 41 % involved the use of plates, 83 % involved the use of reamed nails, and 78 % involved the use of external fixators.	0.6843898239589827
Fracture location near the diaphyseal-metaphyseal junctions was common in this problematic group.	0.2967499631241136
Ninety-two percent of all plates led to atrophic nonunions.	0.38714746646125503
There were 21 open fractures and of these 90 % (n = 19) developed an atrophic pseudarthrosis and 29 % (n = 6) developed a wound infection.	0.6977762931301549
Fifty-seven (39 %) of all patients had additional injuries, but we found that did not increase the risk of disturbed bone healing.	0.8475172130358238
Our revision operations focused on the elimination of wound infections, refreshment of bone healing, and improvement in fragment stability.	0.559391665319977
Only 28 % of all "classic" plates and 11 % of all external fixators were changed to an intramedullary implant at the time of the first revision surgery.	0.7775058592296596
Hypertrophic nonunions required a mean of 1.3 revision operations to achieve bone healing whereas a mean of 2 revision operations were necessary to fuse atrophic bone ends (P < 0.05).	0.5682227380112973
In cases of diaphyseal pseudarthrosis healing time was not affected by the type of osteosynthesis used for primary reconstructions.	0.5153672939367382
Since lack of fracture healing can often already be observed directly from postoperative X-rays, we recommend that revision procedures be performed early.	0.6176714117259436
The prolonged length of time to care for femoral nonunions underlines the importance of appropriate primary fracture treatment.	0.38980857119883905
That takes into consideration both the biomechanical and the biological aspects of bone healing.	0.5305571935836657
Background: In a prospective trial (October 1996 - April 1998) the effect of octreotide and tamoxifen on the recurrence of pancreatic carcinoma after R0 resection was evaluated.	0.7823618902975746
Methods: Patients with a local recurrence after curative resection of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with 100 µg of octreotide three times a day and tamoxifen 20 mg once daily.	0.7546970197230495
The median survival time, quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-30) and side effects of the octreotide-tamoxifen group were compared with a historic cohort (n = 14) of patients treated in our department (9/95-9/96) according to the "best supportive care" concept.	0.7985326259137564
Results: Recurrences were diagnosed after R0 resection in a mean time of 13  +/-  6.8 months.	0.6886055701808146
Patients treated with octreotide and tamoxifen had a significantly (P < 0.05) longer median survival time (7 months; range: 3-12) vs 3.5 months; range: 1.5-5).	0.7782093615311948
The octreotide-tamoxifen group suffered less from lack of appetite, nausea, fatigue, and pain and needed fewer analgesies.	0.5594802622077165
The only side effect of the octreotide-tamoxifen therapy was moderate diarrhoe in 2 patients at the beginning of the therapy.	0.6700677943483079
Conclusion: Since combined therapy with octreotide and tamoxifen can be administered comfortably for outpatient treatment, this seems to represent progress in the palliative therapy of pancreatic cancer.	0.6604607456818602
Objective: To study the influence of dopexamine on pulmonary shunt and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction during major thoracic surgery with one-lung ventilation (OLV).	0.49499115859082726
Design: Prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled study.	0.5933373791024815
Patients: Twenty adult patients undergoing elective pulmonary resection.	0.45597826449905854
Anaesthesia: General anaesthesia was performed using propofol, fentanyl, N2O and vecuronium.Volume-controlled ventilation was performed to maintain normocapnia over the whole investigation period.	0.6309534372336087
During OLV, the tidal volume was reduced and the respiratory rate was increased to avoid a peak airway pressure exceeding 40 cm H2O.	0.5691018288666
Furthermore the FiO2 was increased to 1,0 and the external PEEP was removed during OLV.	0.63302978289122
Interventions: The patients received either dopexamine at 2 µg/kg/min (group A, n=10) or 0,9% saline as control (group B, n=10) after assessing the baseline values.	0.8352548589213472
Measurement and results: The following cardiorespiratory variables were recorded: Heart rate, mean arterial pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure.	0.6501376950667844

Cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index, pulmonary vascular resistance index, oxygen delivery index (DO2I), oxygen consumption index and the venous admixture were calculated using standard formula.	0.6068719216315139
Furthermore, pressure-flow-curves were constructed to analyse flow independent changes in the pulmonary vascular resistance.	0.5996185114266533
Data were recorded at the following times: After induction of anaesthesia in stable haemodynamics during two-lung ventilation (baseline values, T0), intraoperatively during one-lung ventilation (T1) and postoperatively after re-establishing two-lung ventilation (T2).	0.505694505706859
Patients characteristics, data from the preoperative lung function testing and surgical procedures did not differ significantly between the groups.	0.7865712545405642
CI increased in the dopexamine group from 2,5 +/- 1,2 l - min-1 - m-2 (T0) to 3,6 +/- 0,9 l - min-1 - m-2 (T1) and 4,0 +/- 1,3 l - min-1 -  m-2 (T2).	0.8383454647864691
The course of the intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting did not differ between the groups.	0.6204407417166868
In the dopexamine-treated group the DO2I increased from 430 +/- 143 ml - min - m-2 (T0) to 652 +/- 255 ml - min - m-2 (T1) and 653 +/- 207 ml - min - m-2 (T2).	0.6123212813493012
Regarding the pressure-flow-curves there was no difference during OLV between the two groups indicating no major blocking effect of dopexamine on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.	0.5976227879996597
Conclusion: It is concluded that dopexamine can be used to improve haemodynamics and oxygen delivery during thoracic surgery without increasing venous admixture during one-lung ventilation.	0.6179235984751796

Regular examinations of prostitutes may reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in this high risk group.	0.5036937087208638
Therefore since April 1988 regular mandatory examinations have been offered by the regional health office in cooperation with the Department of Dermatology of the Ruhr-University of Bochum.	0.513671254829562
The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance and efficiency of such an examination.	0.555156212942874
The study was based on anonymous questionnaires.	0.6376515141395671
Mean age of the 80 prostitutes was 31.4; 67 of then were born in Germany.	0.5636523136954505
78 of the women always used condoms, while 71 thought that condoms prevent STDs.	0.5455254244833301
Three women suffered from a STD in the last 12 months.	0.7299778458096521
The majority the women (75 from this 80 prostitutes) did not perceive the examination as discrimination, while 71 felt the examinations were of high quality.	0.6406251871353533
These results indicate that regular mandatory examinations should be part of health prevention care of prostitutes and that they are well accepted and tolerated by these women.	0.5318171724591584
Atrial fibrillation and related arrhythmias are common after cardiac surgery.	0.5008955642905814
As more and more elderly patients are operated on for cardiac diseases, the interest in this arrhythmia is growing again.	0.6020111850345125

Reevaluation of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery by review of recent literature.	0.6137561887841354
Usually postsurgical atrial fibrillation is transient, self-limiting, and benign.	0.6863584698511856
Nevertheless, among patients affected by this arrhythmia, morbidity, mortality and costs by hospital stay are higher than without this complication.	0.5992909516881798
In addition, postsurgical atrial fibrillation can increase morbidity and mortality by itself.	0.4908369916416098
Today, general recommendations for prevention of atrial fibrillation following surgery do not exist but may be developed in the future.	0.73895267764076
According to the clinical course, therapy has to consider ventricular rate control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and rhythm control.	0.7921896401341662
Usually therapy is restricted to the postoperative time.	0.5303524903760665
Atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery has to be respected in order to minimize overall complication rate.	0.6289659985400097
The influence of aspirin treatment on haemostasis is still under debate.	0.4353485127619104
There are doubts in emergency operations, especially in transplant patients, concerning dosage and change in medication.	0.5861407393072828
Our results are based on an analysis of the therapeutic approaches in German transplantation centres.	0.7845908843967588
The question of transplant suitability, dosage and haemostatic effects are discussed with respect to the literature.	0.5867466035098069
Some 92.11 % of the transplantation centres perform the operation even though the patient has been treated with aspirin.	0.7511063834354478
In these cases an increased bleeding tendency is tolerated and observed in 34.2 % of the centres.	0.6596210666797492
An increased mortality has not been reported.	0.6395377467241858
Most of the transplantation centres accept a dosage of 100 mg aspirin daily.	0.5044785527107468
Only 7.89 % of the transplantation centres refuse to operate on aspirin-treated patients.	0.5711083891567998
Correctly indicated aspirin treatment (for cardiac arrhythmia, embolism, or thrombosis, for example) does not contraindicate renal transplantation (daily dosage up to 100 mg).	0.6507023233489218
In elective surgery, however, a preoperative change in medication is recommended, e. g., the heparin instead of aspirin.	0.5388342295759614
Full-thickness defects of the thoracic wall following tumor resection, irradiation damage or secondary wound healing in thoracic surgery require early interdisciplinary cooperation to achieve patient-specific treatment modalities.	0.5813579539386855
Plastic surgical differential therapy allowing for sufficient soft tissue coverage, stabilisation of the thoracic wall and space filling in intrathoracic cavities, is presented and critically discussed.	0.6082820579518292

This retrospective study presents the results of 41 patients with a lateral clavicle fracture eight years after the treatment at the Staatliche Orthopädische Klinik of the LMU München in the time between 31.10.1979 and 31.10.1994.	0.6999338490578232
It could be shown that the lateral clavicle fractures, due to their variety, hold a special position among the clavicle fractures and thus need a differanciated therapeutic procedure.	0.514171240905155
Among the operation methods the K-wire stabilisaton with cerclage was the most often chosen operation technique i.e.	0.48625018601985287
The K-wire without cerclage was used in two cases.	0.6448343112647529
Twelfe fractures were treated with AO-plate-osteosynthesis.	0.44901550298006304

Single stage urthroplasty with an onlay patch graft of penile skin or buccal mucosa is an effective treatment for patients with complex anterior urethral stricture disease.	0.4897876766577929
Using buccal mucosa, operative time is substantially reduced by using a two-team approach in which one team harvests the graft from the mouth while a perineal team simultaneously exposes and calibrates the stricture.	0.5126416800530487
Excellent results can be expected using grafts urethral substitution in men with refractory bulbar strictures.	0.4839901627418721
Focal areas of severe stenosis may be excised from the graft bed.	0.38100360337376554
For patients with long or dense strictures, grafts may easily be combined with other tissue transfer techniques.	0.5443515050233636
Background: As the slit-lamp technique is an restrictive method for the in-vivo examination and documentation of the multi-layer structure and the dynamics of the tear film and the cornea, e. g. during wound-healing processes, our aim was to find out whether it is possible to change the confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (CLSO; Zeiss) into a high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) for the visualization of the anterior segments of the eye and the tear film by adapting a special objective system.	0.7023341804427246
In order to gain information concerning the function of such a cornea microscope we examined selected patients with erosion or pterygium before and after operation and subsequent phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), as well as some in-vitro corneal surfaces after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).	0.6014111358890262
From 3 years' experience with nearly 100 transinguinal preperitoneal mesh prosthesis (TIPP) repairs for recurrent inguinal hernia the indication, anesthesia, modification of the technique, and results are reported.	0.5584847196736624
After intraoperative classification of the hernia, the TIPP repair is indicated especially in large defects of the posterior wall (L/M III).	0.7015387180755347
The procedure is easily performed under local anesthesia.	0.4694266113536151
During 52 local TIPP repairs, conversion of anesthesia was never necessary.	0.38329676386710954
Important technical details include the requirement for a sufficient size of mesh (10 cm x 15 cm) and a certain caudal and cranial fixation of the prosthesis using at least three interrupted stitches for each.	0.6955085323037191
Apart from an increased number of seromas (12 %) in the early postoperative period, the results of the TIPP are comparable with those obtained after Shouldice repair for recurrent hernia.	0.7810028344837444
The rate of hematomas, infections, and testicular complications range between 1 % and 3 %.	0.8472861938269597
Considering the negative case selection of only large recurrent hernias, the TIPP repair reveals a favourably low 1-year recurrence rate of 1 %.	0.64173757645147
If representatives of the law suspect anyone of drug smuggling by internal bodily concealment and refers the person to hospital, the doctor is requested to recover the ingested drug packets by induction of emesis with syrup of ipecacuanha or apomorphin a.	0.4362439747001638
The permission of this induction as a coercive measure is controversial.	0.2968121041118208
The policemen, the public prosecutor or the judge has to decide, whether the induction of emesis is really necessary, the physician has to declare the risks.	0.6055042464390686
Especially when there are only a few drug-containers and the person is no professial "body-packer", non-invasive diagnostic ways also can lead the evidence of incorporated drugs.	0.5900385754523597
Rupture of the drug containers leads to acute intoxication and the physician must regard the person as his patient, he has to refuse the role as medical expert for the representatives of law.	0.5934963050790684
The deformity in severe spondylolisthesis consists of two components: the parallel anterocaudad slip of the spondylolisthetic vertebra, and its tilt into kyphotic malposition.	0.5313266573872765
The influence of the two components is very different: the anterocaudad slippage has not much impact on the sagittal profile of the spine and is easily compensated for by a slight increase in lumbar lordosis.	0.7156347809656998
The kyphotic deformity has a high impact on trunk imbalance and the sagittal profile.	0.45823777944975047
There are two compensation mechanisms: hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine to its anatomical extremes and - if that is not sufficient - verticalisation of the sacral bone, performed by contracture of the hamstrings and uprighting of the pelvis around the hip joints.	0.6016670862799746
The latter mechanism is followed by functional disadvantages.	0.40009188879164664
Therefore, correction of the kyphosis of L5 may be considered during operative treatment if the lumbosacral kyphosis (angle delta) is less than 85  ° and the sacral inclination less than 35  °.	0.6156335243804397
The diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities includes analysis of the geometry of the whole leg.	0.6597009696558239
The first step in the diagnostic process is a standardized physical examination.	0.6418095663225306
It provides valuable background information for an effective radiological diagnosis.	0.4437429829327129
Even with a thorough standardized physical examination it is not possible to define exactly the deformity or decide on an operative procedure.	0.5908705837152318
The diagnosis of axis deviations in the frontal plane can be measured on a conventional plain X-ray of the whole leg.	0.6865420863301898
In this view it is very important that the knee joints are in a true a. p. view independent on torsional deformities of the lower legs.	0.6846959456828496
Today the gold standard to measure the torsion and length of the lower extremities is the CT scan.	0.6485090756739362
However, the multitude of analytical methods for CT measurements described in the literature do not lend themselves readily to comparison; thus, it is difficult to identify a clear method of choice.	0.6411991170324178
Not every CT measurement is better than a physical examination.	0.37219803752259467
Evidence of reproducibility and accuracy is a prerequisite for useful interpretation of the results.	0.5004349658436805
Up to this point in the literature there are only reference values for the Ulm CT Method.	0.8084210780405429
One alternative is the MR scan, which avoids radiological risks, but the reproducibility and accuracy of the MRI method are not as good as for the CT method.	0.7417610580072646
Another alternative is ultrasound, where recent advances in the measurement of torsion and length of the lower extremities have proven competitive with or superior to the accuracy of MRI.	0.6658940523258913
The three-dimensional determination of the torsion and length of the lower extremities by ultrasound has now assumed a leading role in the non-radiological diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities in children and adolescents.	0.6571039534175832
This method furthermore is increasingly being used in preoperative planning of leg deformities in adults.	0.48169832870178764
Purpose: Management of organ-confined RCC is primarily surgical.	0.3868816874935128
5-year survival rates of all stages improved from 40 % in the 1950th to 50 % in the 60th, and stagnate at 60 % in recent series.	0.9092774862770272
Paramount use of ultrasound in modern medicine has been claimed to contribute significantly to an earlier detection of RCC thus better amenable for radical operation.	0.4336859754576994
Other factors may have been strategies and general hospital care.	0.41329878629808864
However, it remains unclear whether an extended lymph node dissection as suggested vy Robson in a seminal paper in the 1960th bears any therapeutic value.	0.5415025955280847
Selected patients with minor lower limb injuries and low risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), who required cast immobilizing and did not receive medical thrombosis prophylaxis, were included in a prospective study.	0.6980059038634522
The decision to give not medical thrombosis prophylaxis depended on an concept of individualised prophylaxis for patients at risk for thromboembolism.	0.5721678436706639
From March 1994 to March 1996 in 178 outpatients (118 men, 60 women, mean age 25,8 [16-39] years) a clinical examination and a colour-coded duplex sonography were performed after removel of the cast for detection of DVT of the lower limb.	0.6536898675265007
A phlebographie was performed when thrombosis was suspected.	0.26978122497724766
Two patients developed a one bundle thrombosis of the calf.	0.4818919704227494
Clinical appearance of lung embolism was not observed.	0.5047498723578606
These results suggest, that low risk patients with minor injuries of the lower limb and plaster cast immobilisation do not need a medical thrombosis prophylaxis.	0.7575408647107047
For the judgment of the quality of medical services and for the progress of clinical medicine the comparison of data and informations of the diagnostic and therapeutic process is demanded.	0.7602086481640989
Therefore a systematic and concrete system of documentation should be implemented in every clinic, which consists of standard nomenclature, classification, instruments of outcome measure and documentation standards.	0.5241287980727964
There are a group of problems and barriers which stand in the way of this goal.	0.5659873623735577
It is useful to build a minimum basis data set which includes core criterias of clinical dokumentation in orthopedic surgery and include this in an information system so that all of these parts are considered and that a central and comparable data pool is offered for patient care, quality management and research.	0.5445446409216256
Basal cell adenocarcinoma was first introduced as an entity in the second edition of the WHO's "Histologic Typing of Salivary Gland Tumours" in 1991.	0.7410170594636895
This tumor was first described in 1990 by Ellis and Wiskovitch from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).	0.3832867918755141
Basal cell adenocarcinoma accounts for about 2.9% of all salivary gland malignancies.	0.7682896868690561
More than 90% of the tumors are situated in the parotid gland.	0.6811187688167248
Intraoral manifestations are known from case reports only.	0.33468373930919787
Tumors of the palate have been mentioned in three cases.	0.5465669323918596
Histologically this tumor can be easily confused with basal cell adenoma and the solid basaloid subtype of adenoid cystic carcinoma.	0.43753776635626435
The case presented here is a middle-aged white woman with a basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.	0.6034945814583372
Therapy consisted of surgical extirpation with three-dimensional safety margins and histologically proven clear resection margins.	0.41823763323152696
Knowledge at this point indicates that basal cell adenocarcinoma has a rather high probability of local recurrence (up to 50%) and a mostly lymphogenous metastatic potential for as long as  10 years after removal of the primary tumor.	0.7615483262921907
Ten year survival is around 75%.	0.3269000645523706
Purpose: To study the incidence and shape of subclinical keratoconus with corneal topography in the fellow eye in the case of clinically, slit-lamp biomicroscopically and topographically diagnosed unilateral disease.	0.5179233930753152
Ischemic heart disease is the most frequent cause of death in industrialized countries.	0.8432235307691212
This is a result of persistent risk factors and aging of the population.	0.7193496204424206
Medical progress with application of conservative, surgical or interventional strategies indeed reduced the morbidity and mortality of arteriosclerotic diseases, but markedly increased the medical care costs.	0.650034565284048
The result is a discussion about the optimal use of the different therapeutic measures under consideration of the evidence based medicine.	0.7384884956074999
The ileal conduit is a simple and safe supravesical urinary diversion with few postoperative complications.	0.4397920077026855
In patients with liver disease with portal hypertension, however, the risk of recurrent, peracute conduit bleeding is increased.	0.6034786203916084
While the diagnosis is simple, several therapeutic options are available.	0.7344236973331204
In most cases the bleeding comes from stomal varices, that can be controlled with local sclerotherapy with 3% Ethoxyscerol or ligation of the bleeding vessel.	0.6626630004985742
The resection of the part of the conduit carrying the varices is an option if bleeding is life threatening or the source cannot be localised.	0.5610254135748811
If bleeding recurs excision of the conduit should be considered.	0.48273111718091644
Malignant disease must be excluded as a bleeding source.	0.48425637347308276
Objectives: The cardiotoxic properties of bupivacain have been well documented under in-vitro, as well as under in-vivio conditions.	0.5716878496898766
A further mechanism of cardiovascular impairment by bupivacaine via the central nervous system gained investigational interest in animal studies.	0.392916474369394
The aim of our study was to demonstrate the effect of a ventriculocisternal perfusion of bupivacain on systemic hemodynamic variabels and their reversability by wash-out with mock-CSF.	0.5181812091394614
In recent years, our knowledge concerning pathophysiological changes in brain metabolism after traumatic brain injury (TBI) has greatly expanded.	0.636721270283737
This, in turn, has enabled the development of specific pharmacological strategies for the supplementary treatment of brain-injured patients with the aim of reducing secondary brain damage.	0.7280401744026483
The present article focuses on the pathophysiology of TBI and the possibilities for pharmacological intervention.	0.5864433893421862
While some of the substances reviewed are presently used in the treatment of TBI, others are under experimental and clinical evaluation at different stages.	0.5604667791619025
This study explored characteristic subjective experiences of schizophrenia.	0.25989948378800076
A questionnaire for self-assessment of disturbances in several cognitive and perceptual areas (the Eppendorf Schizophrenia Inventory, or ESI) was constructed and administered to first-episode schizophrenics (SCHe, n=45), negative syndrome schizophrenics (SCHn, n=45), remitted schizophrenics (SCHr, n=24), depressives (DEP, n=43), alcoholics (ALK, n=48), obsessive-compulsive patients (ZWA, n=46), and healthy controls (KON, n=57).	0.5051313058661366
Comparisons between the SCHe, SCHn, DEP, ALK, and ZWA groups and a subsequent factor analysis revealed four schizophrenia-specific dimensions: attention and speech impairment (AS), ideas of reference (IR), auditory uncertainty (AU), and deviant perception (DP).	0.5074325322420096
Further analyses suggested that the AS syndrome may represent a mediating vulnerability factor while IR, AU, and DP probably are reversible episode indicators.	0.4499827082702571
The results may contribute to refinements in the measurement of specific prepsychotic signs, thus facilitating the development of early intervention approaches.	0.5480465845487122
Introduction: The conservative treatment of the most severe cases of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) can be sometimes frustrating.	0.8270243888383342
Especially with an underlying autoimmunologic disorder, even the application of artificial tears as often as every 5 min may not prevent further damage to the ocular surface.	0.5625748337743381
A microvascular transplantation of the autologous submandibular gland (SG) can be performed by a maxillo-facial surgeon as an alternative approach for those cases.	0.645990024475297
We report 2 years of ophthalmological experience with the results of this procedure.	0.8612233630889011
Aims: The predominant cause of death due to oral cancer is the failure to control local tumor due to regional tumor recurrence.	0.6270825814176691
The sequelae of surgical resection and high-dose irradiation cause substantial changes in head and neck anatomy, leading to considerable problems in the early morphological detection of recurrent disease.	0.7176573110632367
Therefore, this study evaluates the verification of cancer recurrence by means of its pathologic glucose metabolism.	0.6593392063470794
Materials and methods: We reviewed a total of 50 [18F]-2-fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) investigations performed in 44 patients who had undergone surgical resection of oral cancer.	0.75442945569929
In 23 cases, re-staging (group A) was indicated due to suspicion of recurrent or secondary tumor manifestation.	0.6499119422241246
In 27 cases, PET served as a screening procedure (group B).	0.6840002394252421
Statistic evaluation included sensitivity, specifity, positive/negative predictive value and accuracy of 18FDG-PET for the detection of tumor manifestation.	0.5119135022644515
Results: 18FDG-PET correctly identified 23 of 26 tumor sites (88%) in the re-staging group and 9 of 10 tumor sites (90%) in the screening group.	0.7316113577257284
We encountered a total number of 16 false-positive foci with an increased 18FDG-uptake.	0.5447396860506207
In six patients, 18FDG-PET detected tumor recurrence several months before a morphological correlative could be identified.	0.4678924710223034
In 5 of these 6 patients, the PET findings for the latter tumor sites determined the patient's fate.	0.6699258608021017
Specificity was 63% for local recurrence, 97% for secondary lymph node involvement and 90% for distant metastasis.	0.8220848952892397
Conclusion: According to these data, 18FDG-PET is the most effective diagnostic tool in the follow-up of oral cancer patients to date.	0.7913040599566533
Due to the high prevalence of recurrent disease in the follow-up of oral cancer, either the detection of early recurrence or the identification of additional, incurable tumors may add substantially to a rational therapeutic management.	0.7399124290635144
We therefore recommend 18FDG-PET for screening and re-staging of recurrent oral cancer.	0.5076184686577945
In over 80 % of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, the Nissen antireflux fundoplication gives good long-term results.	0.6994475205706406
Dysphagia, inability to belch or vomit as well as the gas bloat syndrome are possible sequelae after fundoplication.	0.41312823718759734
The frequency of these symptoms could be reduced by modification of the original Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication into the so-called "floppy" Nissen fundoplication, a short and loose wrap of mobilized gastric fundus.	0.6445916284003431
Failures of the antireflux procedure are mainly due to disruption or displacement of the wrap with the telescope phenomenon.	0.35719776788047447
Here, reoperation with refashioning of the original wrap may lead to same functional results like a primary fundoplication.	0.4694943885309929
Technical alternatives may selectively be chosen, when gastroesophageal reflux disease is complicated by fixated hiatal hernia, esophageal shortening, or serious esophageal motility disorders.	0.47386682888143494
Such specific anatomic or functional abnormalities are detected by preoperative endoscopy, barium swallow, 24-h pH monitoring, and manometry.	0.5546276641851976
Alternative techniques are mainly transthoracic repairs, including the Nissen fundoplication, Collis gastroplasty, and the Belsey Mark IV.	0.6555238183108588
Modifications of the 360  ° Nissen operation are partial fundoplications like the Hill repair and the Toupet dorsal fundoplication.	0.35065564095492807
Because of a high failure rate in the long-term follow-up, application of the ligamentum teres cardiopexy and of the Angelchik prosthesis is not recommended.	0.6869016744757972
We report a sporadic case of giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) starting in a 5-year-old boy with gait disturbance.	0.6714848963195654
At the age of 10 years he showed signs of a sensomotoric polyneuropathy and central neurological symptoms: intention tremor, nystagmus and visual disturbance.	0.4958495262519726
The boy also had curly hair.	0.22407784920275184
Sural nerve biopsy showed many giant axons with accumulation of microfilaments, which were also found in cytoplasma of Schwann cells, endothelial cells and fibrocytes.	0.6390673994315892
Similar changes were detected in endothelial cells of a muscle biopsy, which additionally displayed neurogenic atrophy and target fibers.	0.604994858048098
Immunohistochemically, desmin, vimentin, heat shock protein 70, and ubiquitin were not detectable in giant axons, which, however, contained neurofilament protein 68, 200 and  -tubulin.	0.6262608546739488
Our case shows that careful ultrastructural examination of a muscle biopsy may point to the diagnosis of GAN.	0.57384924931238
The endoscopic release of the carpal ligament gives the opportunity to treat the carpal tunnel syndrome in a comfortable and minimal invasive way.	0.49686568057062
Between 1 October 1994 and 7 May 1995, 46 patients who underwent endoscopic surgery on 55 hands were documented in a prospective study.	0.6885163726048055
The following results were taken from a questionnaire.	0.5291626521389602
There were not any complaints, or the complaints were so much diminished that complete division of the carpal ligament could be viewed as accomplished in 51 of 55 cases.	0.5776593839122918
There were continuing complaints in four cases, and after an additional check two patients were operated on again.	0.7766437229587614
The advantage of the endoscopic method is the inconspicuous scar and the reduced postoperative disablement.	0.5577966598331591
For surgical removal of a malignant choroid melanoma, it is necessary to reduce systolic blood pressure to around 50-60 mmHg in order to prevent choroidal haemorrhages.	0.7356068452337636
However, blood pressure reduction is associated with the risk of cerebral ischaemia.	0.7580926178330334
We report a patient with a malignant choroid melanoma in whom waves I and II of the brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) disappeared during surgery under controlled arterial hypotension and hypothermia (31.1 ° C).	0.6048397837085416
The waves could be recorded again immediately after the mean arterial pressure was increased from 48 to 77 mmHg.	0.5406937976151766
The oesophageal temperature had dropped by 0.3 ° C at this time.	0.527388092736778
The 2-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no irregularities during this time period.	0.6500056174502566
A bilateral, reversible, apparently blood-pressure-dependent loss of waves I and II during arterial hypotension despite a normal EEG has to our knowledge not been previously described in the literature.	0.5514335746544655
The isolated loss of waves I and II with maintenance of waves III, IV, and V is unusual.	0.5928474953895543
The literature contains reports of acoustic neurinoma patients in whom only wave V could be recorded.	0.5631301315649231
This is regarded as an indication of continued impulse conduction despite the loss of waves I to IV.	0.5178263778110337
Others have observed a patient with temporary and reversible loss of BAEP wave I due to vasospasm of the internal auditory artery that apparently occurred during or shortly after manipulation of the internal auditory meatus.	0.5358582026935524
Assuming anatomic peculiarities in the blood supply to the generators of the BAEP waves, a stenosis of the basilar artery could be considered as the cause of the bilateral reversible loss of waves I and II.	0.6633155004384148
Another potential source could be the induced hypothermia, but this does not seem very likely because the patient's temperature was 0.3 ° C lower at the return of the waves than at their loss.	0.7663441525502704
In the syndrome arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy, little is known to date about the mechanism for the development of arrhythmias.	0.5284330035864453
In a group of 54 patients with documented ventricular tachycardia during longterm ECG recordings, the determinants for the development of VT and the relationship between signal-averaged ECG and the morphological characteristics of the disease are investigated.	0.7093924807181143
The analysis of the long-term electrocardiographic data includes the measurement of RR-intervals 30, 15, 5, 1min and immediately before onset of the VT, the determination of the morphology of the previous ventricular premature beats, and the frequency of the atrial arrhythmias.	0.7669522308970117
Normal values for the analysis of late potentials in the ECG signal accquisition with bidirectional filters between 40 and 300Hz were defined a maximum of 113ms for a QRS width, LAS of 38ms, and RMS40 of 16uV.	0.5415519173223724
The analysis of the long-term ECG produced monomorphic VT in all cases without previous atrial arrhythmia and in only 4 cases with previous polymorphic ventricular premature beats.	0.618111499701546
A long-short phenomenon could only be proven in 4VT episodes.	0.5566640861491347
In 84% of all tachycardias, no arrhythmia were found immediately before onset of the arrhythmic event.	0.6917878493228258
According to the circadian clock, two peaks, mornings between 6 and 9h and evenings between 6 and 9h, could be determined.	0.5776871971514603
In patients, who were recently diagnosed with ARVD, a significant shortening of the RR intervals before the onset of VT as an indication of an acceleration of the sinus rhythm was observed.	0.7518220485541937
This effect could not be observed in patients with a past medical history of AVRD.	0.7702359599228724
Late potentials were determined with a prevalence of 74% overall.	0.5667773472827504
Increasingly, late potentials were observed with morphologically diffuse forms of the ARVD.	0.6133014634411105
A correlation to the severity of spontaneous arrhythmias (ventricular, sustained or not sustained VT) could not be established.	0.5987622271594032
In comparison to the origin of VT in coronary heart disease, previous arrhythmias play a less important role in arrhymogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy.	0.5828606180610495
Most importantly, an intensified sympathetic tone before onset of VT and an increased prevalence of positive late potentials are observed.	0.5972697031377612
We present the case of a 54-year-old male patient with a Syme amputation of his left leg following diabetic gangrene of the foot.	0.5338025121963168
A  local infection of the stump was treated successfully with two  endoscopic debridements and lavage.	0.5342857107131836
Additionally, the patient received local antibiotics by the application of antibiotic collagenous fleece and antibiotic chains.	0.6691017133619725
This therapeutic management combined with early weight bearing led to a stable stump.	0.4785223338136804
We describe an eighteen-months-old boy, who suffered from congenital vitium cordis, jejunalatresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphies and psychomotor retardation in connection with a partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.	0.47829756441794163
In most cases the genesis of brachial plexus palsy is traumatic, often because of bike accidents.	0.6333647524832501
If physiotherapy and neurosurgical procedures such as nerve repair do not have the desired outcome, muscle transfer operations are possible.	0.5275415246094289
The results of our favored transfer of the trapezius muscle to compensate paralysis of the deltoid muscle will be presented.	0.6028650673316691
Preoperatively radiological, clinical and electromyographic examinations are necessary.	0.5706976175081899
Our results are based upon the clinical and radiological check ups and the subjective assessment of the patients.	0.8398826352225485
Thirty-one patients (7 female, 24 male) underwent a trapezius transfer between March 1994 and December 1996.	0.7350152986805832
The average age was 29 years (range 18-46 years).	0.7367900314766079
We performed the operations using a modification of Saha's technique.	0.3684068237758218
With the patient in lateral decubitus position and protection of the opposite plexus, a sagital skin incision is the first step, followed by the preparation of trapezius and deltoid muscle as well as the bony parts of the shoulder (acromion, clavicle, scapular spine).	0.7084742883975303
The deltoid origin is cut from the lateral third of the clavicle, the acromion and the lateral half of the scapular spine.	0.6367483662840578
The next step is transection of the root of the acromion and the lateral clavicle.	0.578550074718125
After elevation of the remaining trapezius insertions from the clavicle and scapular spine, the proximal humerus is exposured by splitting the partly detached deltoid muscle longitudinally.	0.5368740699489388
Then the acromion fragment and humerus are prepared for the bone-to-bone contact.	0.5210290638058865
In 90  ° of abduction the acromion fragment with its trapezius insertion is transferred and fixed to the humerus with two 4.5-mm screws.	0.6667647116809462
Finally the deltoid is sutured on the top of the trapezius and the skin is closed over two suction drains.	0.5124564134350164
Postoperatively we immobilize the operated arm in an abduction support for 6 weeks.	0.36583266430637407
The physiotherapy program starts on the first postoperative day with active training of elbow, hand and fingers and electrostimulation of the transferred trapezius muscle.	0.4902479514007502
Six weeks after the procedure we take an X-ray and start with progressive adduction of the arm.	0.7113913231606809
The preoperative subluxation of the humeral head was abolished in all cases.	0.4850956341956908
We achieved an average increase of active abduction from 7.3  ° (range 0-45  °) preoperatively to 39.2  ° (range 25  °-80  °) 1 year after the operation; the increase of forward flexion was from 20  ° (range 0  °-85  °) to 43  ° (range 20  °-90  °).	0.8720223397101968
All patients were satisfied with the improvement of stability and function of the operated shoulder.	0.7595588123245095
Finally we can conclude that the trapezius transfer for flail shoulder gives a satisfactory outcome regarding shoulder function and stability as well as the subjective situation of the patients.	0.5695846006957928
We analyzed psychiatric and criminological data from 103 arsonists.	0.2803623922548447
The following criticisms of the definition of pyromania according to DSM-III-R and IDC-10 seem appropriate.	0.44137363653819456
First, the categoric exclusion of aggressive motives does not seem very promising, since approximately one fourth of arsonists whose firesetting is based on motives quoted in DSM-III-R may also have an aggressive motive.	0.5622261389467659
Second, ICD-10 gives being drunk and alcoholism as a criterion for the exclusion of pyromania.	0.3736759878786838
This seems untenable, since the behavior classed as pyromania is largely a product of alcohol misuse.	0.484919140677704
Repeated firesetting, resulting from being fascinated by fire etc., may be less a disturbance of impulse control but rather the manifestation of a psychoinfantilism, which, supported by alcohol abuse, extends into older age.	0.6052605193799239
The mean age of such arsonists is slightly above 20 years.	0.49361237188708257
The tendency for relapses after imprisonment seems to be low; this tendency probably decreases spontaneously in older age.	0.5106897762785904
The mean age of arsonists with aggressive motives is a little below 30 years, those setting fire with suicidal motives have a mean age of 35, deluded arsonists have a mean age of 40 years.	0.6166242735443349
Concrete sexual motives are relatively rare.	0.27031603607104043
Approximately 50 % of arsonists have a purely aggressive motive.	0.5915438980505298
Retaliation is a rare cause, however, since most of them do not even know the victims.	0.7198831090762268
One third of these persons set the fire in their own homes.	0.49960644742217547
Most arsonists show a personality disorder, with insecurity and narcissism predominating.	0.5101284841529081
Data on firesetting are to be treated with caution, since two thirds of all cases are newer resolved; one fourth of cases concern minors, and in Central Europe arsonists with rational motives are hardly ever referred to psychiatrists.	0.7238373484558289
A normal ciliary beat frequency of ciliated cells is necessary for the mucociliary clearance of the nose and paranasal sinuses.	0.48060337082006926
An in vitro investigation was performed to eval-uate the influence of topical corticosteroids and antihistamines on the ciliary beat frequency of human nasal mucosa.	0.5913598843400059
The nasal sprays examined contained the corticosteroids budesonide or fluticasone propionate and the topical antihistamines azelastine or levocabastine.	0.28166760032964155
All tests were performed on cell cultures of human nasal mucosa during constant conditions.	0.48684466392411835
Three of the four nasal sprays tested contained benzalkonium chloride as preservative.	0.4246314102555243
An irreversible cessation of ciliary movement was observed in all cells exposed to nasal sprays containing benzalkonium chloride in a 50 per cent solution.	0.49537486354031196
The nasal spray containing budesonide was benzalkonium chloride-free and caused minor but fully reversible decreases in ciliary beat frequency after 20 min.	0.40038511975448815
As benzalkonium chloride can cause complete standstill of ciliary beat frequency in vitro in human nasal mucosa, we recommend that this preservative should not be used anymore in topical nasal medications.	0.596655661154818
The treatment of patients with severe burn injuries is expensive and belongs in the hands of specialized burn centres.	0.6212806720270844
In our burn centre 257 patients were treated from 1991 to June 1995 (between 50 and 60 patients per year except for 1993 with 77 patients).	0.5593783661347991
Patients were evaluated according to the ABSI score (mean 7) and had mortality of around 15%.	0.8234794055875433
The costs range between 3.7 and 4.8 million DM per year, the profit lies in the same range.	0.8239494302101814
The costs are divided into staff costs (1.4 - 1.8 million DM per year), costs for medical treatment (1.5 - 1.9 million DM per year) and costs for internal services (600 000 - 900 000 DM per year) such as laboratory examinations (247 000 - 386 000 DM per year) and blood bank (100 000 - 215 000 DM per year), the main factors in this category.	0.7801612122269261
The different fields of costs and profit are compared in this analysis.	0.4356696288030939
Possible ways of reducing costs are pointed out, and the question of effectiveness of therapy is discussed.	0.7646571579653656
Conclusions from this analysis are limited by the individuality of each case with different clinical courses, the great number of influencing factors and the comparably small numbers of patients.	0.6229626315730256
In benign laryngotracheal stenosis the amount of respiratory deterioration rather than the crude morphologic appearance will determine whether or not surgical measures such as dilatation or resection should be applied.	0.4378833805438812
This review focusses on currently available and newly developed diagnostic tools to assess the functional importance of central airway obstruction.	0.44362808673413606
After an outline of upper airway physiology is formulated, spirometric measurements at rest are collected.	0.3948917651019752
Among these, Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEF) proved to be the simplest and most reliable parameter to monitor an obstructing lesion of the upper airways.	0.6666155678799142
A novel technique for fibrobronchoscopic assessment of glottic and tracheal resistance is presented in detail.	0.411499606221756
In contrast to usual tests of total airflow resistance which cannot distinguish between central and peripheral contributions, this test identifies the pressure-flow-relationship created exclusively by the local lesion.	0.5314494223688095
In serial stenoses, it indicates which is of higher clinical impact.	0.6212687639239467
Patients with upper airway obstruction complain of impaired exercise capacity.	0.37653569441953993
They tend to hypoventilate with imminent respiratory muscle fatigue.	0.2802173973667001
Therefore, spiroergometry may play a role in defining the point of incomplete compensation of a central load.	0.5753271212773643
The decision to operate will depend upon up the degree of physical capacity required to compensate for the stenosis.	0.5372478266975909
Stroke units are hospital-based special wards aiming at optimal care by a specialized team with an integrated concept for patients with acute strokes.	0.5583513129925747
Following the initial neurolo-gical and neuroradiological evaluation, early treatment will be initiated based on the assumed pathophysiology of the stroke.	0.5341536922564295
Acute management includes monitoring of physiological, parameters, care by specialized nurses, and early implementation of physiotherapists, speech therapy and occupational therapy.	0.5246026336362023
Despite the increased initial costs, the long-term burden for the health system is decreased by shorter hospital stay and reduced morbidity and disability.	0.5977382003346968
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the most important side-effect of heparin therapy.	0.8528302017911535
Two types of thrombocytopenia can be caused by heparin: a frequent non-immunologic type causing a minor decrease in thrombocyte count without apparent clinical importance and, on the other hand, an immunologic type accompanied by thromboembolic complications.	0.5191038676448565
Patients and methods: We report on two cases with HIT type II after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).	0.6635188665364125
HIT antibodies were demonstrated by ELISA for platelet-factor-4-heparin-complex and heparin-induced platelet-activation (HIPA) assay.	0.524140518887741
Results: A 67 year old patient suffered from a HIT type II seven days after administration of heparin during myocardial revascularization.	0.6224831799125358
In this patient, a continuous fever and a signicantly reduced general condition were the primary symptoms.	0.6935758490190104
The clinical picture of this disease was reversible after aborting the heparin therapy.	0.6792327259351102
Thromboembolic complications did not occur.	0.17070337514081513
A 70 year old patient developed a HIT type II with thromboembolic complications 13 days after CABG.	0.6624704800009991
The vascular occlusions affected the A. spinalis anterior with the development of a spinalis anterior-syndrome, the coronary arteries with the development of myocadial infarction, and the A. iliaca interna.	0.7064926555877914
A white-clot syndrome with thrombi in the ascending aorta, in the left atrium, and in the left ventricle required an operation with extracorporal circulation including the use of recombinant hirudin for anticoagulation.	0.8245874729154392
Conclusion: With therapy with heparin, it is obligatory to check platelet count.	0.6052447543178344
An indication for the development of HIT type II is a decrease in platelet count or thromboembolic complications during heparin therapy.	0.5514535439658943
In the case of HIT type II recombinant hirudin was a practical altenative as an anticoagulant for extracorporal circulation and for continous hemofiltration.	0.44473042703464166
Oxygen radicals and oxygen radial mediators are thought to be important components in the development of acute lung injury, sepsis, and multiple organ failure.	0.6255439484356854
Injured patients, patients with pulmonary diseases, and multiple trauma patients also showed an elevated lipid peroxidation, indicating increased oxidant stress.	0.8172271686796742
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has been used as an antioxidant in a wide variety of experiments.	0.6869753701957952
NAC has been suggested to act by raising concentrations of cysteine, and hence glutathione, and by scavenging of oxidant species [1, 11, 17, 29].	0.7350552558648034
The present study was designed to investigate whether the application of NAC in intubated patients has an effect on concentrations of reduced glutathione in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and on the lipid peroxidation products malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes.	0.5754196106213987
Because NAC has been widely used as a mucolytic drug for the treatment of lung diseases, the influence on tracheobronchial mucus was studied, too.	0.6379473084089547
Between 1990 and 1995, 27 patients with posttraumatic disorders of the subtalar joint were treated by correcting fusion.	0.7652170905477919
Preoperatively 24 patients (88.89 %) suffered from pain; 15 (55.56 %) had a walking range below 100 m. Seven patients were unable to work in their original profession.	0.7209671718121381
After an average period of 13.85 months postoperatively the patients were examined again.	0.7850101125967437
At this time 18 (66.67 %) had no or minimal pain; 19 (70.37 %) had no claudication.	0.815125069848927
According to the score of Angus and Skuginna, in 81.48 % of patients the result of the correcting arthrodesis was successful; according to Kitaoka's clinical rating system for ankle-hindfoot, midfoot, hallux and lesser toes, the average postoperative score was 75.8 points.	0.7197994680205774
Objective: To examine changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) in children in the last twenty years and to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity.	0.8023781055933463
The review of medication has been recommended as an important part in preventing falls.	0.6885657016790105
In a random sample of 276 hospital in-patients aged 75 and over, the frequency of prescribed drugs which may increase the risk of falling by causing dizziness was assessed.	0.5079843431820792
Questions about dizziness and previous falls were included in a standardized questionnaire.	0.5029077752871282
Migration of an impacted mandibular premolar is a rare finding, whereas dystopia of lower jaw cuspids is described much more often in the literature.	0.6766383919450556
We present a patient in whom radiographic studies show the migration of a mandibular premolar to the muscular process over a period of 14 years.	0.551681808288337
Most of the tooth migration along the vertical portion of the mandibula into the processus muscularis took place after the root development had ended.	0.4194688005509626
Neither radiological nor clinical examination revealed the stimulus which changed the path and the direction of the impacted tooth.	0.4676443561206315
In atopic eczema patients the well-known abnormal cutaneous reactivity of the blood vessels (white dermographism, delayed blanch after acetylcholine, paradoxical blanching after nicotinic acid application and diminished erythema after histamine injection) were observed during acute eczematous episodes and later in an eczema-free state in comparison with controls.	0.5877436487033473
In this follow-up study the use of different stimuli allowed us to demonstrate abnormal cutaneous vascular reactions in the patients depending on the severity of their atopic eczema.	0.6500520050310106
Severely affected patients showed persistence of the paradoxical vascular reactions even in an eczema-free cutaneous state.	0.3750574040090708
We report on a 9-year-old girl with a giant cell fibroblastoma of the right anterior chest wall.	0.7105180568785204
This rare soft tissue tumour occurs predominantly in the first two decades of life.	0.7148768375656501
The typical clinical presentation is a solitary, usually 2-6 cm large, non-tender mass of blue-greyish colour which is mostly located on the back, anterior chest wall, thigh or groin.	0.6433293655328787
The histology shows a loose infiltrate of predominantly bland spindle cells in dermis and subcutis.	0.34282644504291854
Characteristic elements of the tumour are large angiectoid branching spaces lacking any endo- or epithelium, and relatively small multinucleated cells (floret cells).	0.565848960224303
The recurrence rate is high if the tumour is not excised with adequate safety margins.	0.47239684811913446
It is of pre-eminent importance to differentiate this rare benign tumor from sarcomas, in order to avoid an inappropriately aggressive therapy.	0.6677297275467052
To correct severe septal deformities, it is often necessary to perform an extracorporal septoplasty with temporary removal of the deviated septal cartilage, followed by straightening and reimplantation into the nose as free graft.	0.5834174387660167
The utilization of a compound graft, which sutures the cartilage fragments to a resorbable polydioxanon (PDS) foil, facilitates this technique immediately while simultaneously ensuring support of the nasal dorsum.	0.5041297961682442
Stress incontinence is the most frequent form of incontinence found in females.	0.6240085865598849
The usual method of surgery for this is to lift the bladder neck towards cranial and ventral.	0.4897567075340784
Two competitive techniques - bladder neck suspension in accordance with Stamey and colposuspension in accordance with Burch - were retrospectively investigated.	0.5811284070334275
A total of 95 women underwent surgery and it was possible to evaluate the postoperative course in 46 and 30 (total 76) patients respectively.	0.7552391819500656
Initially, both surgical techniques demonstrated a very good success rate (91.3 % and 96.7 % resp.).	0.8256414566212958
However, the continence rate of the Stamey patients deteriorated after 6 weeks down to 78.3 % and after more than 2 years only 28.6 % of these patients were still completely continent (mean follow-up 40.4 mths), whereas deterioration in the Burch patients was only 87 % (mean follow-up 44.25 mths).	0.8382043998798363
The disappointing results with the Stamey technique did not correlate with the degree of initial continence.	0.48818031664048245
It was noted here that obese patients showed a greater tendency towards regression.	0.5658997853297048
The three cases of recurring incontinence after Burch colposuspension were already relapses at the time of surgery.	0.5419430393959984
With respect to long-term follow-up, our results with the Stamey method were distinctly poorer than with the Burch technique.	0.6200823995416154
Therefore, in our opinion, the Burch colposuspension procedure and fascioplasty should be the method of choice for the management of stress incontinence.	0.8210203931096961
This paper is concerned with the relationship between social inequality and psychiatric disorders, an issue being neglected in German psychiatry for a long time.	0.5700537055263771
Social inequality will be discussed in it's dimensions "socioeconomic status" and "sex" referring to the present state of epidemiological and sociological knowledge.	0.5896388625071893
Because such macrosocial factors offer little explanation for the association with psychiatric disorders by themselves microsocial concepts of burden and resources are necessary to link the structural and the individual level.	0.4809631762688735
These concepts are considered to be one pathway by which the mechanisms to disease may occur.	0.5474232277403548
A short review of empirical findings and analytic approaches show the complexity of these mechanisms requiering further research not only because of analytic deficiences but also because of social change.	0.43832449087142805
Further research will concern in general the explanation of social patterns of diseases, in detail the link between individual stress and coping with the social structure, and last but not least a gender-sensitive approach to psychiatric disorders which is more differenciated.	0.6302666595332879
It is well known that alterations to the oral cavity caused by dental prostheses may affect speech articulation, although influences on the voice are not assumed.	0.5874080184538524
In addition to the vocal fundamental frequency, vibrations of the vocal chords generate overtones.	0.5463267475435377
Through the shape of the larynx and the upper airway, resonances and antiresonances are formed, and in this way overtones are amplified to a variable extent.	0.7531232902609548
Nozzle changes caused by a dental prosthesis in the oral cavity may possibly influence overtones but influences on the vocal fundamental frequency seem unlikely.	0.46901394650397243
The influence of dental prostheses on the voice is demonstrated in a patient who owned two different dental prostheses.	0.7015175827714091
The fundamental frequency rose by up to five semitones during speech and his vocal range increased by up to four semitones when a thin denture was used instead of a normal denture.	0.45302898126771196
When the position of the mandible was checked by intraoral needle point placement, a more rostral position of the mandible was recorded with the thin denture than with the normal denture.	0.7220563293964676
Sagittal magnetic resonance tomography imaging also showed that the larynx was in a more cranial position.	0.5985499746892732
This change was presumed to be due to an upward movement of the larynx induced by the tongue, which itself was found to be in a more cranial position with the thin denture.	0.7218168489484799
In this situation, increased tension of the laryngeal muscles were believed to induce a rise in fundamental frequency, shifting the voice range toward higher frequencies.	0.5707128998598407
These findings show that dental prostheses can cause vocal changes in individual cases.	0.4067088598467656
The etiology of this occurrence is still not clear.	0.6459156156956614
Its consequences, however, should be known to the dentist, ENT surgeon and phoniatrist if patients notice changes in their voice after having altered or replaced their dentures.	0.4224457551444955
Cytokine blood levels are found to be moderately elevated in chronic heart failure, as a function of severity of disease.	0.699039642406212
The source of these cytokines and the trigger mechanisms stimulating cytokine release are a matter of intense research.	0.4434851394981843
Potential players include bacterial endotoxin from intestinal translocation, a neurohumoral dysbalance with an enhanced sympathetic tone or an overspill of cytoines from the failing heart itself.	0.37664270603433925
We present arguments in favor of a direct link between the chronically enhanced sympathetic tone in heart failure and the clinically over activation of the immune system, particularly interleukin 6 release.	0.6535189653899698
Objectives: This 1998 survey was carried out on the use of the sitting position for neurosurgical procedures in the posterior fossa and operations of the craniospinal and cervical spine region by the dorsal approach.	0.6113881518854632
In addition, anesthetic management of the sitting position and the compliance with recommendations of the Neuroanesthesia Study Group of the German Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI) published in 1995 were investigated and compared to results of a 1995 survey.	0.6569537529888749
Polar body analysis is a perfect tool to exclude genetically altered oocytes prior to fertilisation.	0.35426418946950855
This helps to improve pregnancy rates and baby take home rates in assisted reproduction, primarily in advanced maternal age patients.	0.40290750379548274
This might reduce the need of invasive prenatal diagnosis for those patients.	0.5988151296261962
Polar body analysis offers treatment in reproductive medicine for female patients carrying a chromosomal aberration or a mutation before they become pregnant.	0.3583021683726838
However, it does not assess the genetic status of the embryo resulting from the oocyte tested and selected.	0.6861523740792149
The paternal contribution to the embryo is left unattended.	0.33605155508679846
Ethical considerations do not play a role, since no manipulation or selection is performed on embryos.	0.5580903552251462
Pachydermoperiostosis (Friedreich-Erb-Arnold syndrome, Touraine-Solente-Golé syndrome) is a rare disease with an autosomal dominant mode of unheritance; it occurs almost exclusively in men.	0.58838081053556
A report of typical pachydermoperiostosis in a 31-year-old man is presented.	0.5477442216227849
Associated features were clubbed digits of the hands and feet with watch-crystal nails, thickening of the skin and soft tissues, hyperhidrosis of hands and feet, hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands with seborrhoea, gynaecomastia, and ophthalmic abnormalities that had been present since puberty.	0.520607639824542
Radiological examination revealed periosteal hyperostosis of the short and long bones.	0.45496200340958737
Endocrine disturbances were not detected.	0.2340911477090668
Skin biopsies showed hypertrophy of the skin and skin appendages.	0.6607135248112649
Primary (idiopathic, hereditary) pachydermoperiostosis should be distinguished from secondary (symptomatic) forms of the disease, which are often associated with lung tumours.	0.6573535251316187
The following review will examine the outcome of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatment studies of anorexia and bulimia nervosa.	0.534759790485461
For both eating disorders, psychotherapy is the treatment of choice.	0.5173376274086601
In clinical practice "treatment packages" are offered to account for the complexity of the disorders.	0.6071720674881831
In bulimia nervosa, cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques have dominated the literature and appear to be successful.	0.5591433594532692
Newer studies reporting on the use of interpersonal therapy also find considerable improvement of symptoms.	0.28469252423431124
Antidepressive medication can be useful in the treatment of bulimia nervosa.	0.5408659303933139
Recently, a stepped care approach to treatment has been recommended, with self-care manuals as the first step.	0.8069205486513886
In anorexia nervosa there is a paucity of controlled clinical trials.	0.4232749033858558
Contingency management for weight restoration can be viewed as a necessary element in all in- and outpatient treatments.	0.5760618158331067
Family therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and psychodynamic approaches have proven useful in clinical practice; however, only a limited data base exists regarding the efficacy of these therapies.	0.6882785022402089
Medication should not be used routinely in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.	0.6039208588408034
Absorption of irrigating fluid in transurethral prostatic resection (TURP) and percutaneous nephrolitholapaxy (PNL) into veins or delayed absorption due to fluid extravasation may result in a TURP syndrome.	0.49051605184837516
The measurement of end-tidal breath alcohol concentration (et AC) as a monitor of absorption of irrigating fluid labelled with 2% ethanol is limited by the disturbance of infrared sensors by volatile anaesthetics and nitrous oxide (N2O) (Fig.	0.6092009038486202
An electrochemical sensor is acceptable for this method.	0.3167066796959417
The aim of the present study was the evaluation of breath alcohol measurements using an electrochemical sensor device (Alcomed 3010, Envitec).	0.5698580411842089
The stability of the sensor in the presence of volatile anaesthetics was examined using a lung model.	0.407252586400223
In a clinical investigation, the device was then applied to spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated patients inhaling volatile anaesthetics during endoscopic urological surgery.	0.527011122264938
Skin diseases, the psyche and psychological changes are often intertwined, especially in patients presenting for expert dermatologic opinion.	0.7045093888767779
In many cases an additional evaluation provided by psychotherapeutic medicine may be necessary.	0.5351790514160536
This resource may help with the diagnosis, explanation of the problem and estimation of the degree of disability.	0.6539545492264102
The different legal guidelines of the various evaluation boards must be considered.	0.5517402926318405
The role of psychotherapeutic evaluation is demonstrated through case examples.	0.348054430529779
The evaluation of new possibly occupationally-related disorders such as multiple chemical sensitivity and mobbing is considered.	0.4224175643924049
We investigated the impact of old age on the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation.	0.4736101816500503
32 depressive inpatients were assessed before and after sleep deprivation by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.	0.3767521747461039
The patients were divided into two groups according to their age.	0.7545040249181322
The result showed no negative impact of old age on the anti-depressant effect of sleep deprivation.	0.4273628318227585
During MRI-controlled resection of brain tumors using an open MRI system, operation-induced alterations may occur, especially enhancement of the resection cavity wall.	0.6618445897532609
This may simulate tumor areas, resulting in false assessment of the resection or resection of non-tumorous areas.	0.5410128503515451
Based on 42 MRI- and biopsy-controlled brain tumor resections in an 0.5 T open MRI (Signa SP, GE), the appearance and origin of operation-induced reactions are analyzed.	0.6143909255936396
In our opinion, there is a superposition of preformed peritumoral reactions by operation-induced microcontusions.	0.5311894019817127
The beginning of the cavity wall enhancement needs at least 10-15 min.	0.5453020114767116
MRI-controlled analysis of the intraoperative steps by the neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist allows discrimination of operation-induced reactions from tumor areas and leads to safe operation.	0.5015454351914825
Angiosarcomas are very rare but highly malignant soft tissue tumors derived from the vascular endothelium.	0.6208177192945272

Background: Lipoprotein (a) is an important codominantly inherited risk factor for coronary disease but there is little data about its distribution in childhood.	0.6985874704156796
Despite the important role of lymph node infiltration for the classification and prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), no standards exist to evaluate the quality of mediastinal lymphadenectomy.	0.6918877441450776
Researches at several centers are not convinced that complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy is necessary.	0.3138052337389538
We investigated 270 consecutive patients undergoing a potential curative operation for NSCLC including complete ipsilateral lymph node dissection in order to ascertain whether or not there is a correlation between tumor localization and lymph node infiltration.	0.6134967186733561
Patients were classified into the UICC (1987) stages I (n = 115), II (n = 42), and IIIa (n = 113).	0.6011279148581312
In patients with N1-positive lymph nodes (n = 61) we found higher 5-year survival for patients with only intrapulmonary lymph node infiltration (39 %) than for patients with hilar infiltration (21 %).	0.733333894037516
Patients with N2 disease showed skip metastases in up to 81 % of cases.	0.6003178480206364
We found that no tumor location predicted the lymph node infiltration.	0.5873700936692758
Due to the variability of lymph node infiltration and the frequently occurring skip metastases, complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy should be the standard for curative operations for NSCLC.	0.6923490731337
The muscles should be viewed as a response member in functional and structural disorders as well as in central control.	0.5732565949958548
This second part of the article will attempt to show not only that the muscles are representing an interesting and sensitive information pool for disorders in the motoric system, but also that lesions in specific leg and hip muscles have an effect on the pelvis and spine and even on scapular mobility.	0.6013580538269417
Purpose: The aim of the study was to apply laparoscopic techniques in reconstructive procedures for aortoiliac occlusive disease.	0.590128361741543
Methods: From February 1996 to February 1998, 16 patients underwent a laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass procedure (ABF) using the transperitoneal approach.	0.7276395222079066
Six, 5 to 12 mm ports were needed to dissect, cross-clamp and divide the infrarenal aorta using specific laparoscopic devices.	0.4448092041325014
The aortic anastomosis was made end-to-side.	0.5508546319159344
A long curved clamp was then passed from each groin to draw the limbs of the graft into the femoral incision.	0.5019078859712667
The distal anastomosis was then performed conventionally.	0.33550009017255283
Results: The laparoscopic ABF was performed successfully in 13 of 16 cases.	0.6431943944679653
Three times a conversion to open surgery was requested.	0.5261351532568719
One patient developed respiratory insufficiency requiring prolonged treatment on the ICU.	0.5259267760076768
Mean operative time was 292 +/- 60 min; the aorta was crossclamped for 74 +/- 18 min.	0.6202629551571196
Two patients needed transfusions of red blood cells.	0.4535384102938978
In the study group, blood loss averaged 566 +/- 434 ml.	0.6594422713789186
The bypass patency and the correct positioning of the graft were assessed by angiography.	0.581519698607777
The patients were discharged 9 +/- 5.8 days after surgery.	0.8091533857745496
At follow-up after 4.5 +/- 4 months, 15 patients were examined noninvasively in the vascular laboratory.	0.8726763074222886
All grafts were patent, and the ischemic symptoms had resolved in 14 patients.	0.6104672663063917
One patient with recurrent claudication had severe stenosis of the left distal anastomosis.	0.6984030830890016
Conclusions: The laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass is a feasible, safe and effective procedure.	0.6494127680000111
Specific laparoscopic instruments are required for the challenging procedure.	0.42902365615428295
The development of vascular staplers and retraction devices will probably reduce the operative time and the technical challenge.	0.4566718792188775
In the future this operative technique may gain relevance as a minimally invasive procedure for severe aortoiliac occlusive disease.	0.587499583892811

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of dermatophytes was established.	0.40580128403028004
The primers "TR1" and "TR2" amplify a 581 bp fragment within the gene coding for the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.	0.5143332661033897
PCR allowed the detection of isolates of 7 common dermatophytes and in addition several yeasts and moulds.	0.4010761016403399
Hybridisation with specific oligonucleotides results in the identification of dermatophytes and Candida albicans.	0.46832600932779483
Restriction analysis of the PCR product allowed us to distinguish between dermatophytes and yeasts or moulds.	0.5355375062425215
The specifity of the PCR with respect to fungi was assessed by testing human DNA collected from 42 dermis and epidermis specimens as well as DNA from selected plants and animals.	0.5054133227439109
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the PCR assay, 69 routinely collected skin and nail specimens were examined by PCR and culture.	0.688838177060837
PCR detected dermatophytes in 35 and culture in 28 of 38 specimens that were classified as positive.	0.4206859940827817
Sensitivity of PCR (92%) was higher than that of culture (73%).	0.6537058838368753
These results show that PCR has advantages over culture for the detection of dermatophytes.	0.42972153522481027
Starting with the recommendations of the "Psychiatrie-Enquête", a current empirical stock-taking was undertaken about the structure of care in psychiatric hospital units.	0.4940621554305866
319 treatment units (289 in Germany, 11 in Austria, and 19 in Switzerland) were investigated concerning size of the treatment unit, number of wards, centrality of admission, existence of large observation rooms ("Wachsäle"), spezialized wards, single sex wards, regionalization/sectorization, open-door wards, coercive measures, and intended structural changes.	0.6350094232315366
The return rate of questionnaires amounted 59%.	0.2985787568970795
The results show that the recommendations of the "Psychiatrie-Enquête" are mostly realized today, but not everywhere.	0.7027337690519964
Across countries differences resulted in size of ward, centrality of admission, open-door wards, and coercive measures.	0.43875802087275323
Treatment units in the western and eastern parts of germany differed in size of ward and centrality of admission.	0.4229152322459514
Differences between psychiatric hospitals, psychiatric departments at general hospitals and psychiatric university hospitals were, though significant, smaller than expected in the light of past controversies.	0.5234437932546567
Intended structural changes mainly concerned open-door wards, internal sectorization, decentralization of admission, and mixing the sexes in single sex wards.	0.43840569008139396

Background: Considering the high recurrence rate after conventional inguinal hernia repair, the totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair has been used.	0.5913118865879636
Methods: The present experience of the authors embraces 1085 patients with a total of 1717 inguinal hernias, including 200 recurrences.	0.7540079758114606
The operative technique is described with emphasis on pitfalls and tricks.	0.6302737411534077
Results: Analysis of the data concerning the first 403 patients with 1 year complete follow-up reveals a mean (SEM) operating time of 42 (1.2) min for unilateral and 58 (1.0) min for bilateral hernia repair.	0.8037048046435649
Mean (SEM) postoperative hospital stay was 2 (0.04) days.	0.5871601042589576
Complication rates during and after operation were 0.3 % and 3.3 % respectively.	0.901489566795308
The morbidity rate at 1 month after operation was 3.5 %.	0.7207839044502843
The recurrence rate was 0.3 % at 1-year follow-up.	0.8844317459170178
Conclusion: Totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair is safe and reproducible for any type of primary or recurrent inguinal hernia, even in patients with previous subumbilical surgery or severe systemic disease.	0.6455838186803166
Careful follow-up is mandatory to assess the late recurrence rate.	0.5862131426681092
Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively whether there are differences in spectrometrically measurable parameters of the fundus between patients with early and late age-related maculopathy (ARM), the children of the ARM patients (F1 generation) and normals.	0.7312979736341245
In approximately 4-10 % of patients presenting with renal cell cancer the transluminal propagation of a tumor thrombus into the vena cava inferior or the right atrium comes to diagnosis.	0.6830080560105785
Recent investigations have indicated that the presence of neoplastic extension into the venous system does not reveal independent prognostic value regarding the clinical course of the disease.	0.614289066282092
Although the complete surgical removal of vena cava thrombosis in patients without simultaneously occurring regional lymph node or distant metastases has become a well established treatment modality, several questions concerning this surgical strategy still remain the subject of ongoing discussions.	0.650898789514116
In the present investigation that included 92 patients with renal cell cancer and intracaval neoplastic extension it was clearly demonstrated that the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest preferably during the removal of intracaval thrombosis extending into the right atrium does not result in a substantially increased treatment-related intra- or postoperative mortality.	0.703449180469761
However, in contrast to a previously reported observation this treatment option did not reveal any substantial impact on the long-term survival of the patients following surgical therapy.	0.8705437808756171
Accordingly, the cranial extension of intracaval thrombosis was not identified as a biological variable of any prognostic importance for renal cell cancer patients.	0.613762533560259
Vascular surgery or penile prosthesis implantation are the main surgical options for erectile dysfunction.	0.5263174484832647
In this category, penile revascularization is the only causal therapy for selected patients: males younger than 50 years of age at time of surgery, maximum of two risk factors, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.	0.5963519855455959
Long-term success decreased to 53 % to 55 % in comparison to first encouraging reports of 80 % success.	0.9170531648267584
Venous surgery resulted in an even more distinct decline of success the longer the elapse of time after surgery.	0.45941579897415447
Long-term success dropped under 40 %, leaving only a few indications for penile venous ligation.	0.6739706177370299
In contrast, penile prosthesis implantation results in high satisfaction rates.	0.41830050476208663
Despite this, it is not generally recommended as first choice surgical management as it is linked to irreversible damage of the cavernosal bodies.	0.6725968008382819
Among numerous types of penile implants, preference is nowadays mostly given to the three-piece hydraulic models.	0.4673217124677218
However, such complications as defective or perforated cylinders in up to 35 % after 5 years have arisen, depending on the type of implant.	0.6953070114115085
In a selected patient group, vacuum constriction devices with a mean patient acceptance of 75 % (50 % to 90 %) seldom result in complications and are thus considered to be a well-established therapeutical option.	0.7448775608225234
It has been suggested that anhedonia, the loss of pleasure, is associated with a dysfunction of the dopaminergic reward system in schizophrenic and alcohol-dependent patients.	0.6350077455225672
In a series of neuroendocrinological and brain imaging studies, we examined pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of dopaminergic neurotransmission in non-human primates and in schizophrenic and alcohol-dependent patients.	0.5418197820168116
Among alcoholics, we found indicators of a sensitization of dopaminergic neurotransmission, which was associated with the relapse risk, but not with anhedonia or depression.	0.8717078178284796
Schizophrenics with neuroleptic blockade of striatal dopamine D2 receptors displayed psychomotor slowing and reduced motivation, but not anhedonia.	0.5536956109928247
Primate studies pointed to the importance of a temporo-cortical dysfunction in the pathogenesis of phasic dopaminergic dysregulation in the striatum.	0.4036646636149983
These observations indicate that a dysfunction of stimulus-dependent dopamine release may be associated with motivational deficits caused by a reduction in incentive salience, but not with anhedonia.	0.6261456036615257
Any operation for lung cancer that is planned as curative includes dissection of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum in order to allow correct staging of the disease.	0.5904839191944297
It is well known that ipsilateral lymph node metastases (N2) mean a poor prognosis.	0.5053987678311412
Since most patients with this finding die from metastatic tumor progression within 3 years after the operation, it can be assumed that positive findings in the mediastinal lymph nodes represent generalization of the cancer.	0.7400664249217551
Therefore, the probability of a therapeutic effect from more radical removal of lymph nodes in the mediastinum is rather low.	0.6247888145308026
On the other hand, it is justified to apply and evaluate additional systemic treatment in these tumor stages.	0.5843014060398831
In analogy with high-dose contrast-enhanced CT, there have been a few studies during recent years that have dealt with high-dose paramagnetic contrast dyes in MRI.	0.7818127170798873
One reason for these studies was the development of new and low-osmolar contrast agents in the MR field.	0.6773182171494238
Depending on the clinical problem, a high-dose contrast study in MRI is rarely indicated: (1) in metastatic disease, MR imaging with high-dose contrast material is indicated when the standard dose study is negative or only shows a solitary cerebral lesion or a number of lesions just suitable for radiosurgery; (2) in patients with malignant glioma the high-dose study allows better definition of the tumor margins.	0.842117616676195
If a radical surgical approach is planned, the diagnostic potential should be fully used; if only a biopsy or subtotal debulking is planned, a standard dose study is enough.	0.6263288798187465
(3) in patients with MS, a high-dose study is only recommended within therapeutic trials in which the number of active plaques is a primary variable.	0.821761048646377
The basic idea of the Collaborative Family Health Care is nothing new.	0.38798122558909953

At a time of basic changes in our health care system caused by cost considerations owing to the cutting back of resources it is important to note, that Collaborative Family Health Care combines aspects of theoretical models and pragmatic action-orientation.	0.5359782216222014
The basic is a systemic view of illness and health.	0.482974073899284
The doctor-patient-dyad is in this view enlarged to a treatment-triad composed of the therapist, the patient and his family, to be able to bundle the whole potential at disposal, i.e.	0.6674296747335207
the treatment motivation of the patient, the support of the family and the expertize of the therapist.	0.7361394520231181
A lot of studies support the resource- saving potential of coopertive methods.	0.3769710980899782
However, their realization is not possible without considerable learning processes of physicians, psychotherapists and other  professionals.	0.6476839785689654
A potential has to be mobilized, which affects by no means only the costs.	0.5356195135957456
The Collaborative Family Health Care offers new challenges to the professional culture of psychotherapists and new chances for influencing the world of medical health care.	0.4315141869975673
At a time of obviously reduced professional solidarity, the iniitiatives of CFHC offer a possibility for physicians, patients and their relatives to reach contentment through cooperation.	0.6514861315872027
Interested colleagues are invited to collaborate in the German Section of the CFHC.	0.5042764661239467
We evaluated the short- to mid-term results of an unconstrained total ankle prosthesis (S. T. A. R.) with uncemented fixation.	0.8669055626367839
Fifty consecutive ankle replacements were performed in 48 patients between 1996 and 1999.	0.52840988462143
The initial diagnosis was posttraumatic osteoarthrosis in 31 cases (62 %), primary osteoarthrosis in 8 cases (16 %), and systemic joint affection in 11 cases (22 %), e. g. rheumatoid arthritis (6 cases), hemochromatosis (2 cases), psoriasis arthritis (1 case), lupus erythematodes (1 case), and sclerodermia (1 case).	0.7196129299366688
There were two perioperative complications: one superficial wound dehiscence that healed uneventfully, and one injury to the dorsal foot artery that necessitated primary reconstruction.	0.5792017847853148
Seven revisions, all in cases of posttraumatic arthrosis, were necessary: local revision of the fibula for painful lateral impingement (3 cases), posteromedial soft tissue revision for painful restriction of dorsiflexion (2 cases), percutaneous lengthening of the Achilles tendon (1 case), and osteotomy and callus distraction for angular correction after stress fracture of the distal tibia (1 case).	0.7064654583659364
At the last follow-up control, 21 patients (62 %) were very satisfied, 10 patients (29 %) were satisfied, and 3 patients (9 %) were satisfied with reservations.	0.9947145125297087
The obtained range of motion was 30  ° (range, 15 to 55  °), with a maximal plantarflexion of 25  ° (range, 15 to 45  °) and dorsiflexion of 5  ° (-3 to 20  °).	0.8792135765369182
When the AOFAS-Hindfoot-Score was applied, the 34 patients scored 84.1 points (range, 44 to 100 points).	0.5552303373410661
After settling of the implants within 6 weeks, no migration was noted in any case, and all implants were considered to be stable.	0.8038400218814236
The favorable results were considered to be a result of the mechanical properties of the S. T. A. R. total ankle prosthesis that allows for unconstrained motion of the polyethylene inlay on the tibial component, e. g. anteroposterior translation, mediolateral translation and axial rotation.	0.6197239050789706
The success of implantation may depend on exact technique, correct hindfoot alignement, sufficient capsuloligamentous stability of the ankle, and a solid bone stock.	0.79394987280197
Although our first results are very encouraging, a longer follow-up is mandatory to answer the question whether ankle replacement is a viable alternative to ankle arthrodesis.	0.586929407637237
In a prospective study, the influence of the status of the peri-implant hard and soft tissues on the success of enosseous dental implants in tumor patients was assessed.	0.701355640400646
Out of 59 tumor patients with 261 implants, treated between July 1988 and August 1996, a pool of 23 patients with 99 implants provided with dentures for at least 1 year was obtained.	0.5755220544696046
Eighteen of these patients suffered from a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.	0.743190376200957
Seventeen patients underwent preoperative radiation (40 Gy).	0.514104966659321
A total of 68 out of 99 implants were inserted into autologous bone transplanted to reconstruct the mandible.	0.48891553964658
In order to assess the peri-implant hard and soft tissues, the Hygiene Index, the Sulcus Bleeding Index, the Gingiva Index, the pocket-probing depth, the peri-implant bone resorption, and the periotest were used.	0.7038051033916435
The results in the tumor patients were compared with the results in a pool of nontumor patients.	1.1526053135341605
Tumor patients had significantly worse peri-implant parameters than nontumor patients.	0.3963112482992137
The peri-implant pocket-probing depth proved to have significant influence on the success rate.	0.6018626172610717
The overall success rate was 77.8%.	0.4373182029625107
Many articles in the literature document the fact that postoperative pain therapy has not improved for decades despite new insights into pain physiology, the availability of powerful analgesics and the development of new techniques.	0.6239328720293449

Ventral spondylodesis using an H-plate was performed.	0.31449916924395116
The patient developed a pharyngovertebral fistula which remained undetected for 1 year.	0.4894411402098251
Spontaneous fusion of C3/C4 and osteolysis of the cortical block occurred.	0.272393990706542
The fistula was demonstrated intraoperatively and the implant was transorally removed.	0.6011488617117883

An interscalene block of the brachial plexus was combined with general anaesthesia for repair of a complex chronic lesion of the shoulder.	0.6621679415689161
The localisation of the plexus with electro-stimulation and the injection of Bupivacain 0.5% were accomplished easily and without painful sensations.	0.6634311550817215
48 hours later the block was still partially present.	0.36706664136194334
Paraesthesia and a sensory and motor innervation deficit affected mainly the dorsal fascicle, but also areas innervated by the median and lateral fascicles.	0.5417711742869904
The deficit did not completely disappear for 18 month.	0.26392647331744473
The cause could have been due to direct traumatisation during blockade or operation, toxic action of the injected substance (Bupivacain 0,5%, 30 ml), distension of the plexus, a cervical syndrome or an aseptic plexitis, although a definite determination is not possible.	0.6709694055724853
However, the pattern of the lesion and the lack of pain during localisation of the plexus and injection favour traumatisation during the acromioplasty.	0.6666824541780585

Systematic investigations on nerve crossing date to the beginning of the nineteenth century and were conducted by Jean Pierre Flourens.	0.38228760810727713
Within 1 week in summer 1864, two French surgeons (Laugier and Nélaton) independently carried out the first nerve sutures in humans.	0.41530455625253493
Their observations of an immediate functional recovery of the appropriate muscles after suturing were discussed controversially in scientific circles.	0.42946443874278223
Purpose: To analyze the value of electrophysiologic testing according to standards of the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) in infants less than 10 years of age.	0.6797630288068041
Aggressive angiomyxoma (AAM) is a tumor of the soft tissues predominantely occurring in the genital and pelvic area with a strong propensity to local recurrences.	0.6147556932952839
The entity was first described in 1983.	0.37912572442773124
The tumor is regarded as low-grade sarcoma by some authors; its cause and pathogenesis are presently unknown.	0.5917075871075526
This is a case report on a 27-year-old man who underwent 4 surgical procedures of the left lower extremity because of a recurrent soft tissue neoplasm, initially (August 1993) diagnosed as a myxolipoma.	0.7979992937559826
The patient suffered from recurrences in February 1995, September 1996 and February 1998.	0.4282497433981629
The diagnosis was revised at the time of the latest recurrence.	0.6605183921608421
A palliative resection with macroscopic residuals left was performed in February 1998, followed by a radiation therapy with 56 Gy total dose and a concomitant administration of the radiosensitizer razoxane per os.	0.5283801331308593
The single radiation doses were 200 cGy 5 times a week.	0.30002126739154267
The small residuals of the tumor obviously regressed although an objective response could not be shown because the lesion was not clearly measurable.	0.627465559380513
A follow-up 2 years after the radiation treatment revealed no recurrence.	0.6279095411799928
The time of the local control achieved as yet is already longer than any former time to regrowth between the surgical procedures.	0.6114501840552542
This is, to our knowledge, the first description of a therapeutic irradiation of a recurrent aggressive angiomyxoma.	0.832939079990468
Radiation therapy combined with the sensitizer razoxane is able to control a recurrent AAM for an unknown time.	0.4687524730839586
It remains open whether a radiation treatment alone would have had a similar effect.	0.4385675340440738
Micronervereconstruction of motor and sensitive nerves in the head and neck area today has an established range of indications.	0.48694095461589637
Surgical procedures of external and internal neurolyses, nerve coaptation and nerve transplantation techniques are well standardized.	0.46007406822214175
With microneurosurgery of motor nerves, satisfying or good results can be generally obtained.	0.4215122802387989
Success rates exceeding 50% following sensitive nerve reconstructions justify the performance of the procedures, more so because of the subjective improvements for the individual patient.	0.6786272412978805
Perspectives can be seen in further simplification of surgical methods of harvesting nerve grafts, e.g., by development of minimally invasive, eventually endoscopically guided procedures.	0.5459971316873947
Allogenic nerve grafts may also be applied.	0.5145736678101228
Initial experiments with nerve distractions are encouraging.	0.23012268921916212
A better understanding of nerve lesions on cellular and molecular biological levels may improve our knowledge of posttraumatic regulatory procedures and may lead to future possibilities of nonsurgical treatment options for peripheral and central nerve lesions by guided regeneration.	0.5144824898711658
Objective: The acceptance of fibromyalgia as a disease entity and its definitive diagnosis have been hampered by a dearth of knowledge concerning the underlying pathophysiology of this disease and the lack of specific biochemical markers applicable to its diagnosis.	0.648730192403845
To determine whether abnormal collagen metabolism is a characteristic of fibromyalgia, we have analyzed collagen metabolites in the urine and serum of patients with fibromyalgia.	0.8103198157749855
Methods: The diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria.	0.5850038591957083
Urine and serum were collected under standardized conditions from 39 patients and 55 age- and sex-matched controls.	0.6111388957032697
Pyridinoline (Pyd) and deoxypyridinoline (Dpyd), which represent products of lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-linking in collagen and are indicators of connective tissue and bone degradation, respectively, were analyzed by ion-paired and gradient HPLC method with fluorescence detection (HPLC).	0.5748875513266005
Levels of hydroxypyroline (Hyp), a collagen turnover marker, were also measured.	0.6131877437061001
The findings were related to creatinine levels and the Pyd/Dpyd ratio determined.	0.42588402816969484
The Pyd/Dpyd ratios in the urine and serum and the Hyp in the urine were significantly lower in patients with fibromyalgia than in healthy controls.	0.6043200180273758
Conclusion: Decreased levels of collagen cross-linking may contribute to remodeling of the extracellular matrix and collagen deposition around the nerve fibers in fibromyalgia and contribute to the lower pain threshold at the tender points.	0.4823014712421934
Analysis of altered collagen metabolism either by histologic examination on biopsy or, preferably, by HPLC analysis of collagen metabolites in urine or serum may aid to understand more about the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia.	0.5280587608583253
Background: The dynamic radionuclide nephrography (Tc99m-MAG3) is an important method in the evaluation of obstruction of the upper urinary tract.	0.7827384730290778
The aim of the present study was to assess whether radionuclid nephrography under standardized conditions with adequate hydration and Furosemid induced diuresis can reliably detect a significant obstruction at the pelvi-ureteric junction.	0.5216798001206343
We therefore tested whether minimal tracer washout (10-25%) in the presence of normal renal function could justity a non-operative managment.	0.6539297235754957
The lateral decubitus position is the standard position for nephrectomies.	0.5436519128824181
There is a lack of data about the effects of this extreme position upon respiratory mechanics and gas exchange.	0.5498881754153182
In 20 patients undergoing surgery in the nephrectomy position, we compared a new closed-loop-controlled ventilation algorithm, adaptive lung ventilation (ALV), which adapts the breathing pattern automatically, to the respiratory mechanics with conventionally controlled mandatory ventilation (CMV).	0.7239712125873604
The aims of our study were (1) to describe positioning effects on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange, (2) to compary ventilatory parameters selected by the ALV controller with traditional settings of CMV, and (3) to assess the individual adaptation of the ventilatory parameters by the ALV controller.	0.6878769987906805
The respirator used was a modified Amadeus ventilator, which is controlled by an external computer and possesses an integrated lung function analyzer.	0.5643505572109355
In a first set of measurements, we compared parameters of respiratory mechanics and gas exchange in the horizontal supine position and 20 min after changing to the nephrectomy position.	0.6710585573774865
In a second set of measurements, patients were ventilated with ALV and CMV using a randomized crossover design.	0.6216038179868697
The CMV settings were a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg body weight, a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min, an I:E ratio of 1:1.5, and an end-inspiratory pause of 30% of inspiratory time.	0.7467588314815244
With both ventilation modes FiO2 was set to 0.5 and PEEP to 3 cm H2O.	0.6323272054004815
During ALV a desired alveolar ventilation of 70 ml/kg KG - min was preset.	0.5859677937583112
All other ventilatory parameters were determined by the ALV controller according to the instantaneously measured respiratory parameters.	0.5490828221966458
Positioning induced a reduction of compliance from 61.6 to 47.9 ml/cm H2O; the respiratory time constant shortened from 1.2 to 1.08 s, whereas physiological dead space increased from 158.9 to 207.5 ml.	0.7509930516064918
On average, the ventilatory parameters selected by the ALV controller resembled very closely those used with CMV.	0.4136663663035775
However, an adaptation to individual respiratory mechanics was clearly evident with ALV.	0.5042185003874473
In conclusion, we found that the effects of positioning for nephrectomy are minor and may give rise to problems only in patients with restrictive lung disease.	0.6900723619773109
The novel ALV controller automatically selects ventilatory parameters that are clinically sound and are better adapted to the respiratory mechanics of ventilated patients than the standardized settings of CMV are.	0.46542544639130523
Noma is an ulcerative-necrotizing gingivo-stomatitis eventually leading to severe destruction of the midface, including lips and cheek, maxilla/mandible, nose and rarely the orbit.	0.4261965331671092
The defects are usually unilateral.	0.3580297394557001
Children from economically underdeveloped countries are predominantly affected.	0.22219304538179183
Medically untreated the disease has a high mortality rate, which can be dramatically lowered by adequate antibiotic therapy started in time.	0.6742334850053905
Predisposing factors include malnourishment, immunosuppression, and poor oral hygiene.	0.4742390199996634
Forty-eight noma patients were surgically treated in Sokoto, Nigeria during October 1997 by an Interplast Germany team sponsored by AWD Stiftung Kinderhilfe.	0.31424908386641026
Interdisciplinary surgical strategies and results, e. g. ankylosis release, local flap coverage and 12 pedicled musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi island flaps, as well as a noma classification (NOMAC), are presented.	0.5520910748085333
During a period of 3 years, four controled clinical studies in 34 patients with hypercholesterolaemia and 40 healthy persons - in some cases with stratification of the basic cholesterol levels and matched pair formation - were performed to find out the effects of serial sun-like UV irradiation on various serum parameters and blood circulation functions.	0.7500715640439615
The following significant effects were observed.	0.33112369955143667
Patients with hypercholesterolaemia: increase of HDL cholesterol after termination of the serial UV irradiation, increase of serum 25 (OH)D3 levels, decrease of serum triiodothyronine, decrease of serum lactate; healthy persons: decrease of resting pulse rate, decrease of recovery pulse rate, decrease of systolic blood pressure.	0.5764079518339477
All effects were induced by application of suberythematous UV doses, i.e.	0.31834715927126067
amounts of UV with a relatively low risk of side effects.	0.5610676443802093
In 1998 Minor et al.	0.18999064585553474
described a new variant of perilymphatic fistula: the "superior canal dehiscence syndrome".	0.43325643560500116
This syndrome is clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo and oscillopsia induced by loud noises or stimuli that result in changes in intracranial or middle ear pressure.	0.37865337398432297
It is caused by a dehiscence of bone overlying the superior (anterior) semicircular canal.	0.5058380400595107
Due to this dehiscence, a third, mobile window (in addition to the round and oval windows) is formed, and changes in pressure are pathologically transduced to the anterior semicircular canal.	0.7015866256508756
In the present study we evaluated proprioceptive capabilities of the knee joint with a balance test and correlated these findings to parameters which document mechanical stability.	0.6207302355175405
We compared 8 conservatively treated and 12 surgically treated patients with ACL-deficient knee joints with a control group of 12 subjects.	0.604927839896879
The balance test was performed with a Kistler force plate.	0.5879939645338736
Both the conservatively treated and the surgically treated patients showed significantly higher deviations of their centre of gravity than the control group.	0.5396874941621396
This was true not only for the injured leg but also for the noninjured contralateral leg.	0.5989949055662104
The differences were most remarkable when comparing the entire distance of centre of gravity deviations during 10 s. Additionally, the conservatively treated patients interrupted the test procedure significantly more frequently than the other two groups.	0.5702504077869868
We were not able to document any correlation between proprioceptive function and parameters for joint stability such as anterior drawer, Lachman, pivot shift and KT-1000 measurements.	0.36242794488456415
The study examined the validity of psychometric measures for the assessment of driving ability in brain-damaged subjects.	0.4910737024294166
116 patients with brain damage mainly of vascular and traumatic origin underwent  extensive neuropsychological examinations emphasizing attentional performance and visual perceptual speed and participated in a comprehensive on-road driving test.	0.4432162279670786
Only 58% of the patients passed the driving test.	0.705488754309661
Attempts to predict the outcome of the driving test by discriminant analysis or cut-off procedures based on neuropsychological and/or other subject-related data yielded a maximum of 73% correct predictions.	0.5658323121593751
In view of the frequent impairment in driving ability after brain damage and in view of the failure to reliably predict driving ability from psychometric test results, it is recommended that in each case an on-road driving test is given.	0.6105146897104916
In the planning of laser surgery for ENT operations, the specialist is often consulted by the anesthesiologist to predict possible intubation problems.	0.5626535045990474
Intubation problems in such operations can occur frequently due to the pathological findings present in the upper aerodigestive tract and the different constructions of laser-resistant endotracheal tubes.	0.6460747338830949
The aim of this study was to determine if a known predictive parameter could have a sufficient sensitivity and specificity to reliably predict possible intubation problems for ENT-related laser surgery.	0.5397809283902176
In a prospective study, 91 patients were included and the Mallampati-score modified by Samsoon and Young was analyzed and compared to a score describing the actual conditions of intubation.	0.600890464399632
The results showed a significant correlation (p <0.05, Chi-Square test).	0.7553254120776441
However, the specificity was only 72% and the sensitivity of 60% was too low to be of practical use.	0.8942482707880289
The results were independent of the endotracheal tube used.	0.7230385034156155
Although use of the laser for ENT operations provides a special situation for the anesthesiologist, there is still no system that is sensitive and specific enough to be of practical use.	0.7009109572853103
This problem is demonstrated in a literature  review.	0.6024647617081558
The treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with contraindications for a thrombolytic therapy is a therapeutic challenge.	0.7634222077081727
We report on a 12 year old patient who was treated for large cell lymphoma according to NHL-BFM 95: Block AA protocol.	0.625220861505828
During his therapy, he developed a thrombosis of his right femoral vein and pulmonary embolism affecting the left segments 4, 5, 8, and 9.	0.7878409923980176
Because of cerebral metastasis a fibrinolytic therapy was contraindicated.	0.31784007759419947
Therefore, we performed a mechanical thrombectomy using the Amplatz thrombectomy device.	0.6493600076677092
The postinterventional scintigraphy showed a markedly improved pulmonary perfusion; dopplersonography 4 months postinterventionally showed a patent right femoral vein.	0.3299563556915039
Within this chapter, tumors which produce bone matrix (osteoid) or other bone-forming tissues, like cartilage, connective tissue, and cementum or originate within the bone marrow are described.	0.6096177354451042
In addition, those lesions are mentioned which, according to the WHO, are typical for the jawbones and are therefore included within the 1992 WHO classification of odontogenic tumors.	0.6551737859070887
Vascular and epithelial tumors which may also be observed in the jaws are not described.	0.6788209617643991
All the lesions and tumors reported have in common a more or less similar clinical and radiological appearance.	0.5352490192748334
A precise diagnosis, therefore, can only be established by a sufficient biopsy which should be seen by a pathologist with experience in this field.	0.6482907814422124
In addition to clinical, radiological, and histological appearances, therapeutic necessities are described.	0.7474559376769122
The data from recent publications are taken into account.	0.5282837231181725
This presentation is based on the data collected within the reference registry of the German-Austrian-Swiss Study Group of Tumors of the Face and Jaws (DÖSAK) in Basel.	0.7841394697743731
Between 1987 and 1996 302 patients were treated for colorectal liver metastases.	0.6695479069837507
Out of this pool 252 completely documented cases were analysed.	0.3595243630715454
Forty-five patients (18 %) of this population were 70 years or older at time of admission.	0.7857928932224683
In this population 17 major resections and 8 minor liver resections were performed.	0.4505144370826993
In 9 patients irresectable metastases were diagnosed during treatment of the primary tumor.	0.6450377614063273
In 3 cases laparotomy had to be finished as exploration.	0.4957599312861364
Eight patients were treated without surgery.	0.6269365935382226
Mortality after liver resection was 4 %, morbidity 28 %.	0.6009776240659211
The 5-year-survival-rate (Kaplan-Meier) of the R0 resected patients (n = 21) was 44 %.	0.758651552331214
Comparison between the elderly patients and the younger population shows no significant differences in type and extent of treatment or in stage of disease.	0.7141847604885312
Survival, morbidity and mortality after liver resection also show no significant differences.	0.7384234234000395
These results show that even in elderly patients liver resection for colorectal metastases can be performed efficently and with a curative intention.	0.6601116161379945
The clinical course of 12 patients with mushroom poisoning was evaluated in order to define the parameters considered to be relevant to the indication for liver transplantation.	0.7605192199989126
Eight patients recovered under conservative therapy; one patient died due to pre-existing, concomitant cardiopulmonary disease.	0.6261762607468939
In three patients transplantations had to be performed because of severe liver failure.	0.7749469302557263
On admission, the transplanted patients had a decreased Quick's test score and factor V value (< 10 %).	0.6425174754155084
The peak of liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, partial thromboplastin time and azotemia were not of any prognostic value.	0.6404937217926656
Main indications for liver transplantation were a very low initial Quick's test score and factor V value (both < 10 %) and their inadequate response under substitution therapy.	0.657547137491433
The development of encephalopathy and renal failure were further parameters indicating poor prognosis.	0.3892269842361412
During submaximal isotonic back extension loading (31 male persons) surface-EMG was measured using 16 monopolar-linked electrodes in the low back region (L 3-S 1).	0.5310351021739884
By means of modification of amplitude- and frequency parameters in the EMG-signal two subject groups (6 persons each) with the slightest and most severe muscle fatigue in the paraspinal region were defined.	0.7048138572008597
For the analysis of muscle coordination, the EMG signal on the basis of an amplitude estimate at the beginning and at the end of the load situation was compared.	0.6609628852892444
During the extension phase, the group with slight fatigability showed no different spatial pattern of myoelectrical activity at the end of investigation than at the beginning.	0.5977861268539083
In contrast to this, the pattern of myoelectrical activity changed during the endurance test in the group of persons with considerable fatigability.	0.611864802283235
Therefore, in addition to the muscular fatigue also the loss of muscle coordination has to be taken into account in the assessment of spinal function.	0.8033935559803507
Background: A fractional flow reserve (FFRmyo) <0.75 is a well validated parameter for significance of coronary stenoses in cases of normal myocardial function.	0.7456903100614728
We used the FFRmyo limit in patients with impaired myocardial perfusion by myocardial infarction and/or hypertension for intermediate stenoses of the LAD for decision to PTCA and checked the indication by clinical follow-up.	0.5516600808341948
Distraction osteogenesis of the mandible is one treatment option in mandibular hypoplasia.	0.588672815016372
Usually, a non-continuous distraction mode is applied.	0.5956060778673669
The aim of the present study was to establish continuous bone distraction using a microhydraulic cylinder.	0.6659708573135864
Using a submandibular approach, the mandible was dissected subperiostally on one side in four mini-pigs; corticotomy was performed and the microhydraulic cylinder fixed with two bicortical screws.	0.5460231658039044
The hydraulic tube was connected with an automatic hydropneumatic injector system.	0.3298280518659307
Following 7 days at rest, a continuous distraction of 1.5 mm per day was performed for 14 days.	0.8480487820958515
After 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively, the animals were killed and X-rays taken.	0.8129475510127655
The mandible was then removed en bloc and microscopic evaluation of the sections was performed.	0.4710896151775451
The microhydraulic cylinder was easy to apply and to handle.	0.41384500619929965
The continuous stimulus did induce direct mineralisation of longitudinal oriented collagenous fibre bundles.	0.256208048550444
Bony regeneration seems to be accelerated, which might reduce the postoperatively stabilizing phase.	0.6393707271299786
The duration of spinal anaesthesia in infants is short compared to adult patients.	0.5155482165932466
When tetracaine is used, the addition of epinephrine significantly prolongs the duration.	0.4751775558358211
For bupivacaine, however, the influence of epinephrine on the duration is not clear.	0.585479400910332
We investigated the effects of epinephrine 1: 200 000 added to bupivacaine 0.5% on duration and haemodynamics.	0.6000857602627929
Ten former pre-term infants with postnatal respiratory problems, scheduled for bilateral inguinal hernia repair, were enrolled in the study after informed parental consent had been obtained.	0.6076209673532864
The infants were fasted at least 4 h prior to surgery.	0.2843878172921682
If they did not receive i.v.	0.305592574061449
infusions before surgery, a bolus of 10 ml/kg Ringer's acetate was injected after inserting the i.v.	0.4960295617893146
cannula, followed by a continuous infusion of 8 ml/kg 2/3 N NaCl with 5% dextrose.	0.5898670445491794
Spinal anaesthesia was performed in a sitting position with 0.6 ml bupivacaine 0.5%.	0.7875392184236361
Five patients received plain bupivacaine (group I) and five bupivacaine with epinephrine 1: 200 000 (group II).	0.7460518867104523
Heart rate registered by ECG and non-invasive blood pressure were recorded prior to positioning the baby for lumbar puncture and 2, 5, 10, and 20 min after injection of bupivacaine.	0.6621314157116801
The duration of spinal anaesthesia was defined as the time from injection to the time when the first movements of the legs were observed after stimulation.	0.8315173215610235
For testing statistical differences the U test was used between the groups and the Wilcoxon and Wilcox test within the groups.	0.490232986078758
Results (expressed as median and range).	0.3518990270237852
Additional epinephrine significantly prolonged the duration of spinal anaesthesia (group II: 95 min [60 - 120] vs group I: 50 min [37 - 85]).	0.7016038911032728
Haemodynamic parameters did not differ at any time between or within the groups.	0.5181556979807775
In group I, one infant had high spinal anaesthesia with impaired respiration but without cardiovascular effects; after 10 min of assisted ventilation by mask, sufficient respiration as judged by pulse oximetry and clinical observation had returned.	0.5670211800504691
The duration of spinal anaesthesia in this child was 60 min.	0.5615562268050002
Epinephrine 1: 200 000 significantly prolongs the duration of spinal anaesthesia in former preterm infants.	0.46477586102821916
Haemodynamic parameters in this age group remain unchanged during spinal anaesthesia and are not influenced by the addition of epinephrine.	0.5639756497538065
Purpose: Debate about the potential implementation of Spiral-CT in diagnostic algorithms of pulmonary embolism are often focussed on sensitivity and specificity in the context of comparative methodologic studies.	0.5729587519719844
We intend to investigate whether additional factors might influence this debate.	0.44034222197358613
Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) should be an "evidence-based" diagnosis derived from clinical and echocardiographic screening of informed and consenting relatives of index patients, and on the examination of clinical reports for deceased relatives.	0.6008934188123289
Most familial dilated cardiomyopathy pedigrees show an autosomal pattern of inheritance.	0.33051583398948986
Very few of them are X-linked and matrilinear.	0.6352945151287818
Autosomal recessive inheritance is difficult to be assessed in an evidence-based setting.	0.5626317819912942
By linkage analysis, several loci, but no disease gene, have been identified.	0.8351788500969398
At present, few cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy can benefit of a molecular diagnosis.	0.4353819124866484
As the results of the structural reform policy regulating the health care sector, the paper presents the possible path of increasing intrasectoral risk selection and intersectoral risk externalization (especially between the law of health care insurance, the law of statutory nursing inusrance, and the German poverty law).	0.7231302217406311
Particularly the new developments in the hospital sector will be analzyed regarding the dynamics of risk selection and risk externalization.	0.6413022748972522
The new economic ways of financing the hospital sector are inducing the need of systematic integration of the different branches of social law, especially more developed networks of the health care, the nursing system, and the social care services.	0.8090243277032825
Purpose: The inactive form of pyruvatekinase could be established in different tumours.	0.6100299139989765
Purpose of this study was to demonstate the presence or absence of the inactive form of pyruvatekinase in renal cell carcinoma, metastases and benign renal tissue by immunohistology.	0.5011855390062459
Introduction: The hemodynamic parameters of 95 patients undergoing maxillary or bimaxillary orthognathic surgery in 1996 and 1997 at the Department of OMF Surgery/Plastic Surgery, Krefeld, Germany, were analyzed retrospectivly to study the effect of intraoperative blood loss.	0.5796454539268158
Materials and methods: The parameters included the blood loss volume, age, weight and sex of the patients, the mode of osteotomy and the operation time, the surgeon, the average blood pressure, the infusion volume, the anesthesiologist, the thrombocyte counts and their function, the activity of the coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII and von-Willebrand-factor, and the pathological coagulation factor counts of each patient, the rate of autologous blood donation and the rate of retransfusion.	0.7484686577937503
Statistical analysis was done using the Speraman-Rho-test.	0.4734661772549202
Results: The average blood loss during maxillary osteotomy was 670  +/-  380 ml and during bimaxillary surgery 1120  +/-  510 ml.	0.6306020606763232
Men lost about 300 ml more than women.	0.22802240372709884
Operations of more than 3.5 h in length led to a blood loss of 1200  +/-  520 ml as opposed to 670  +/-  310 ml.	0.6552609603324874
The average blood loss among various surgeons was between 670 ml and 1180 ml of various anesthesiologists between 730 ml and 1200 ml, without statistical evidence.	0.4370178479141141
Some 17.9% of patients showed pathological thrombocytic function concerning medication with aspirin; 34.7% had pathological activities of coagulation factors, but only 2.1% with clinical significance.	0.8266982491911802
Conclusion: Mode of operation, maxillary or bimaxillary, und length of operation were the most significant factors of intraoperative blood loss.	0.5920986025945331
Patients with pathological coagulation had nearly the same rate of blood loss as patients with physiological coagulation.	0.47932813134640323
In most cases this was determined by restriction of aspirin.	0.5851796708102593
Analysis of the rate of autologous blood retransfusion showed a significant correlation to blood loss in bimaxillary surgery.	0.7266601387172521
Maxillary osteotomy led to a retransfusion of only 14.2% of autologous blood unit.	0.6762810815942606
This should be reviewed critically especially concerning costs.	0.3776736063962182
Purpose: Course and pathophysiology of a typical syndrome after irradiation of the cauda equina were studied.	0.464133139289084
Wells' syndrome (eosinophilic cellulitis) is a rare inflammatory skin disease of unknown etiology and pathogenesis.	0.6960154640453825
Only 18 cases in childhood have been reported.	0.4563881954027626
We report on a 5-year-old girl who showed the typical biphasic and recurrent course of the disease: initially edematous-cellulitic lesions associated with blisters, followed by morphea-like changes on the extremities.	0.6605324652090192
Eosinophilia of peripheral blood was apparent, which, however, was not correlated with the severity of the current condition.	0.8103485201513689
After a recurrent course for 4 months and intermittent systemic administration of antibiotics (on the assumption of erysipelas and phlegmon) and glucocorticosteroids, the disease healed without sequelae.	0.7207496137160625
Trigger factors or systemic hematologic malignancy could not be detected.	0.350109214935673
Diskussion: Wells' syndrome is probably more common than believed and should be included in the differential diagnosis of urticarial, morphea-like and bullous eruptions in childhood.	0.4340211651436977
In 1996, several employees of the French governmental organization for Blood Collection and Transfusions (CNTS) have been condemned by ordinary courts.	0.503044693567553
They were found guilty in the affair on HIV-infected blood transfusions.	0.4198140554166573
Over 3800 persons, mostly hemophiliacs, have been infected in France and suffer from HIV disease.	0.534006698671337
Many of them died already.	0.46977159008727815
The public in France urgently demanded the condemnation of the persons who were politically responsible for the time delay that postponed the introduction of HIV-tests for blood donations in France.	0.4786593895590708
Such a test was available from the american company ABBOTT in the early 1985, but the french authorities preferred to wait for the HIV-Test from Pasteur-Diagnostics.	0.6329915270449096
A special court, the "Court de Justice de la République", authorized to judge on members of  the governement, has been created by the French Parliament on Nov. 23, 1993.	0.49504222835816997
Six years later, the three politicians, the former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, the minister for  Social Affairs, Mme Georgina Dufoix, and  her undersecretary of state for health, Mr.  Edmond Hervé, have been accused of involuntary homicide.	0.660581759791571
March, 9, 1999, after five weeks of deliberations and statements, the CJR rendered his sentence: The former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and the Minister  G. Dufoix were discharged, but the secretary of state for health, Edmond Hervé, has been declared guilty.	0.5634895020623043
However, also Mr. Hervé could leave the court room as a free person, because the President of the Court, Mr. Christian Le Gunehec, didn't want to pronounce a judgement against him, as Mr. Hervé had to suffer from almost 15 years of public  critics and attacks before he was found guilty.	0.541181524428632
The hemophiliacs and other AIDS-patients as well as their families protested loudly against this judgement.	0.41826475954920905
They plan to file charges against the three ministers through a common court to hold them responsible.	0.30716921662901814
Classical insight therapy, derived from Freud, and `maternal' holding therapy, derived from Balint, Winnicott and others, are two contrasting treatment techniques in psychoanalysis.	0.4903241746161555
The authors believe that each of these two techniques presupposes specific philosophical basic assumptions about the nature of human beings.	0.6202143293523568
The position of Freud is that of the basically traumatic character of human experience.	0.5415436612497424
The contra-position of the object relation psychologists stipulates the priority of love in human experience.	0.32700940464585265
These assumptions seem to be more latent than overt guidelines of therapeutical techniques and therefore their reconstruction and reformulation have important implications for psychoanalytical therapy.	0.43578213020383416
Univentricular hearts represent rare complex cardial malformations.	0.1555521094795675
We report a case of a 34-year old male with single ventricle, two atria, tricuspid atresia, large atrial septal defect, complete transposition and pulmonary valvar stenosis.	0.7234355013488812
There were no signs of chronic pulmonary hypertension.	0.5373277097963566
Intensive clinical analysis of the cardiac malformation was first performed at the age of five years.	0.6539065255580321
Conclusion was that the patient would have no benefit from operation.	0.548823833787229
The patient had nearly normal live conditions with a profession, family and some sportive activities like squash.	0.5219581950220764
He died of sudden cardiac death.	0.29014851347593307
The malformation was examined by sequential segmental analysis and in comparison with the embryonic development.	0.5419317970676988
Clinical picture, prognosis and therapy are reported from literature.	0.6045965737427808
During the last years development of cardiac surgery achieved good results.	0.6590509406248254
Special morphologic constellations, as in our case, may be the reason that conservative therapy can be sufficient for prolonged survival with good quality of life.	0.799188851349948
The assessment and measurement of pain is essential in the implementation and control of pain relieving strategies.	0.673780946602635
The measurement of pain in infants and children should be based on the consideration of age, cognitive level, psychological status, intercurrent diseases and the social context in order to register the child's individual situation and to avoid misinterpretation.	0.694420678739927
From its origin to its death the human organism is submitted to functional, material and morphological changes that are perceptible.	0.4480520248148113
These changes permit classifying an individual as young, adult, old, active or infirm.	0.44675492885798906
But this estimation is not always correct.	0.5038826464871149
Some appear younger, some older than expected from their chronological age.	0.472977226598784
But what is ageing and how can it be measured?	0.2572868157359818
For this, so-called markers or biological markers of ageing are used which are measurable indicators of ageing in live organisms.	0.4763307060143147
A description of the complexity, the asynchronous course and the biological variety and variability of biological age is less successful with a single indicator than with the inclusion of several markers in a multi-factorial measuring system, in a so-called test battery.	0.6940165650383446
Various test batteries have already been applied in numerous studies that consist of biochemical scans, mental and also social parameters in different combinations.	0.5115477370341377
A more precise description of such a test battery can be seen in the following discussion of the ILSE study.	0.8346833756173336
The documentation form for pathohistologic findings (version III) for tumors of the maxillofacial region is presented.	0.5493281916636739
It is part of the site-specific documentation of the German Association of Tumor Centers (ADT).	0.5898372170232716
Its handling is explained by instructions which are based on the ICD-O classification and the TNM system.	0.5266697748423612
The prognostic relevance of the standardized documentation has already been proven by various histomorphologic investigations concerning oral and oropharyngeal cancer.	0.420305097583538
By means of a multicentric observational study the German Austrian Swiss co-operative group DÖSAK will develop a new prognostic model for oral and oropharyngeal cancer.	0.4417851772027441
The development of a middle ear cholesteatoma is usually associated with chronic inflammation and displacement of the mucosa present by the invading squamous epithelium.	0.5804906000524013
To analyze the clinically different behaviors of both epithelia, we used immunohistochemical methods to study the distribution and expression of interleukin-1 (Il-1), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-), epidermal growth factor (EGF), epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R), the proliferation marker MIB 1, c-myc proto-oncogene product and activation marker 4F2.	0.6197122796278369
Results stromal that keratinocytes in a cholesteatoma exhibited a much higher activation and proliferation rate when compared to middle ear mucosa cells.	0.4769708587560771
Middle ear epithelial cells showed no immunoreactivity for TGF-alpha, EGF-R, Il-1 and c-myc in contrast to the markedly positive immunoreactivity found in cholesteatoma matrix.	0.5606938311895997
The local release of cytokines and growth factors, such as TGF-alpha, EGF and Il-1 by inflammatory cells seems to be an important factor for the hyperproliferative behavior of cholesteatoma epithelium.	0.6647603016037803
Our findings could contribute to the pathogenesis of middle ear cholesteatoma and give a possible explanation for the sustained progression of its growth leading to displacement of the middle ear mucosa.	0.615579749594977
The role of hip sonography in neonatal hip screening is still a controversial matter.	0.576519790084226
This paper reports the results of the Austrian ultrasound hip screening program, in which all Austrian babies undergo hip sonography twice: at the birth clinic during the 1st week of life and at an age of 12-16 weeks.	0.7696938504567148
Data from all public health insurance companies since 1985 and all ICD data about children hospitalized because of CDH in Austria were collected and analyzed.	0.43796367948804615
The rate of sonographically pathological hips was 6.57 % (1994).	0.5718185294166712
The treatment rate before introduction of hip sonography was 13.16 % (1985).	0.6578371906680883
The rate of open reduction went down to 0.24 per 1000 newborns, including a high number of unscreened children born abroad and also children with teratological dislocation of the hip.	0.6207136150705719
Hip sonography screening proved to be effective in detecting true instability of the hip joint as well as dysplasia.	0.5935528204779712
The optimal time for sonographic screening does not seem to be immediately after birth when only "high risk" hips (clinical instability, positive family history, breech delivery) should undergo hip sonography, but at an age between 4 and 6 weeks when the hip has already shown its true nature.	0.6655118031065955
Since one sonographic scan appears to be sufficient for screening, a further reduction of costs could be accomplished.	0.6579224619125441
Disability owing to DDH can be avoided in a number of cases, and costs for conservative and surgical treatment as well as for later endoprostheses and early retirement can be economized.	0.7098408865611825
Transactional analysis (Berne 1958) in its original concepts was intended to help even lay people to understand personal structures and psychodynamic processes.	0.483364860383091
This intention lead some of the following authors to superficiality and a "happy-go-lucky" perspective.	0.47831118704046693
Others, most of all European transactional analysts went back to the roots of the original contents and aims and showed that they offer great clinical relevance for the understanding and treatment of a variety of disturbances.	0.6636957649996059
This article will illustrate these aspects, using the borderline syndrome as an example.	0.6873555572041883
The structural model of egostates serves to describe the borderline structure, concepts of the frame of reference and the script as patterns for the development and maintenance of the pathology, the concepts of transactions, games, symbioses and passivity as indicators for the stable instability of the relationships, and devaluations and grandiosities as examples of defence patterns.	0.5861341931249084
Practical ideas about the therapeutic contract as a basis of various working agreements, about methods of decreasing anxiety in therapeutic processes, and about contact and attachment as a substrate for corrective experiences, a healing atmosphere and dedramatisation of the process follow.	0.5182868758373252
The article ends with transactional analytic considerations of transference, counter-transference and how to deal with regression processes.	0.36693641772028923
After separation of symblepharons in ocular pemphigoid, transplantation of nasal or bucal mucosa is recommended to prevent recurrent lid fusion; however, it is not always successful.	0.5341587852021559
The disturbance of generalized cheerfulness (serene-calmness disorder) is an illness, which is often recognised very late.	0.6848484928600427
It is characterised by a uniformity of psychic experience in the face of circumstances which would otherwise give cause for depressiveness, despair, great anxiety, self-accusations or aggression directed against others.	0.4738914175723842
Early diagnosis and specific therapy may decisively improve life-quality of the patients and may also prevent detrimental individual and social long-term consequences.	0.788267167544528
Disturbances of microcirculation in coronary artery disease can be seen in the presence of critical stenosis of epicardial coronary arteries, as a result of endothelial dysfunction in the absence of significant stenosis or during recovery of ischaemic myocardium after successful angioplasty of stenosed or occluded coronary arteries.	0.613853924072568
Diagnostic methods are morphologic/morphometric analyses, measurement of the global coronary reserve, measurement of the regional coronary microcirculation (scintigraphy, positron emission tomography) and laboratory analysis of haemorheological alterations (plasma, erythrocytes, leucocytes).	0.5038015109642141
After successful angioplasty, normalisation of glutamate extraction rate takes three to six months.	0.4571779034701465
In patients with unstable angina, changes in plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation and neutrophil activation occur.	0.5110748024339529
Neutrophils are activated after successful angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction and even after elective angioplasty (when measured in the coronary sinus).	0.6080531921250768
Therapeutic improvements of disturbed microvascular flow can be obtained by increasing perfusion pressure (by revascularisation, nitrates, calcium antagnoists, physical training), by improving the fluidity of the blood and by reducing the extravascular component of coronary vascular resistance (by antihypertensive treatment).	0.6650383124259424
Intracytoplasmic injection of sperm (ICSI) extracted from testicular tissue (TESE) represents the only possibility for men with non-obstructive azoospermia to father a child.	0.4475641254527996
ICSI is also the only treatment for men with obstructive azoospermia if microsurgery is not possible or not successful.	0.5376810581885152
However, approximately only every fifth treatment cycle leads to a pregnancy.	0.4396898296074516
Thus, in most cases, several treatment cycles have to be performed to achieve a pregnancy and therefore testicular biopsies have to be taken several times.	0.905814495565607
Cryopreservation of testicular tissue offers the possibility to store testicular tissue for several treatment cycles of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and to detach surgical sperm retrieval in the man and infertility treatment in the woman (ovarian stimulation, ovum pick-up, embryo transfer).	0.5857588716564869
For the man, cryopreservation offers the advantage that only one testicular biopsy has to be performed for diagnostic reasons and for sperm retrieval.	0.6255005529709693
The advantage for the women is that infertility treatment is started only if testicular histology confirms spermatids, at least in the testicular tissue.	0.5270353516737254
The cumulative pregnancy rate of IVF/ICSI/TESE-cycles can be increased by cryopreservation of supernumerary pronuclear stage oocytes and embryo transfer after thawing in successive cycles.	0.3549340233543905

In Europe, saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis represents the only mycotic infection relevant for thoracic surgery.	0.3749363974929376
From the pathogenetic point of view, it is a colonization of preexisting lung or pleural cavities following other severe pulmonary diseases.	0.5188485671659756
The incidence amounts to 0.4% among patients in a special hospital for pulmonary diseases.	0.7359459205150959
Concerning this review, the diagnosis is based on histologic examination for all 66 patients we operated on between 1961 and 1996.	0.7187822628358109
Preoperative proof of the fungal infection remains difficult.	0.32922605801954946
The majority of patients (77%) are male.	0.6980715084276339
There is a correlation between cigarette smoking and abuse of alcohol on the one hand and the incidence of the disease on the other hand.	0.7464942708729081
A higher incidence of saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis was found for people working in agriculture, in the building trade, and in paper mills.	0.7284989970935762
Pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia were present in the past history in 47% of the patients.	0.7646820298497861
Usually, the tentative diagnosis is based on chest x-ray, especially if hemoptysis is present.	0.7250618950081333
Major hemoptysis is the most severe and most dangerous complication caused by aspergilloma.	0.6351156768302442
Clinical presentation and chest x-ray findings are non-characteristic.	0.4527614332279537
Nowadays, the typical x-ray of pulmonary aspergilloma, almost always localized in the upper lobes, became a rare finding.	0.7779546171443612
If an aspergillus infection is suspected, serologic methods are reliable and sensitive.	0.3426831023642504
A surgical procedure is absolutely indicated in patients with major hemoptysis in their history, in case of disease progression or indeterminate mass and in order to avoid fungal dissemination.	0.6693919191401563
If a saprophytic aspergillosis is suspected according to radiologic findings, clinical examination, and patient's social history, an operation is justified.	0.6965617027003976
Relative surgical indications are hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects of the mycotoxins.	0.4384744432542864
The lobectomy, if necessary carried out as pleuro-lobectomy, is the adequate resection in most patients (68%).	0.7914975804112561
However, this operation is technically demanding and it usually requires a longer operating time as compared to lobectomies for other underlying diseases.	0.6360510304661584
Peri- and postoperative complications occur in 60% of resections for pulmonary aspergilloma.	0.874259669517838
A higher incidence of postoperative complications was found for smaller resections, like segmentectomies or wedge resections, as compared to lobectomies.	0.7480077686312617
Persistent pleural space problems connected with a prolonged stay in the hospital remains the main problem.	0.6849780542066087
It requires a primary or secondary thoracoplasty in a number of patients.	0.4880721338082151
The operative mortality rate is 3%.	0.4074459472104571
A systemic antifungal therapy is not an appropriate treatment for saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis and can even cause specific complications.	0.5685854554341747
Introduction: Postoperative delirium is a common psychic disturbance occurring acutely after various surgical procedures and typically presenting with a fluctuating course.	0.6109000954409604
These patients' recovery takes longer.	0.2721747194770017
In this study we analyze the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing vascular surgery and try to identify risk factors for its development.	0.8066413612189153
Methods: Patients undergoing elective arterial operations were included.	0.5708208132698711
Their medical history, the specific vascular diagnosis and operation performed, the medication and laboratory data were monitored.	0.6794105149141252
Additionally the patients were preoperatively interviewed by a psychiatrist.	0.5691284704194262
Intraoperatively the drugs, infusions, possible transfusions, blood gases and pressures were monitored, as were the times of surgery and anesthesia.	0.7170430661055927
Postoperatively patients were seen daily by the psychiatrist and the surgeon for at least 7 days.	0.44825887655491353
Postoperative delirium was diagnosed according to DSM IV criteria, and mild, moderate and severe delirium were distinguished.	0.601041119626067
Results: Fifty-four patients entered the study.	0.4713701232562151
Twenty-one (38.9 %) developed postoperative delirium (11 mild, 2 moderate, 8 severe).	0.8270847859035741
Patients with aortic operations developed delirium more frequently than those with non-aortic procedures(55.5 vs 22.2 %, n = 27 each).	0.5840097471302875
Some preexisting diseases (hearing disturbance) increased the probability of postoperative delirium, while age was not identified as a risk factor.	0.6707155681092206
General psychopathological and depressive disturbances increased the likelihood of postoperative delirium.	0.3797289945393085
Patients who had a severe intraoperative course developed postoperative delirium more frequently.	0.5811365181916395
This was not seen in the absolute time of surgery or anesthesia nor in the intraoperative development of blood pressure or intraarterial gases, which did not differ between patients with and without postoperative delirium.	0.7215608097943814
More reliable parameters were an increased intraoperative need for crystalloid volume, intra - or postoperatively decreased hemoglobin values (Hb < 10 g/dl) and the development of acidosis that had to be treated.	0.8420288294488135
Patients with delirium had serious complications more often (8/21 = 38.1 % vs 6/33 = 18.2 %) and needed Intensive Care treatment longer (2.7 vs 2.1 days, only aortic surgery 3.2 vs 2.4 days).	0.8528128979264253
Conclusions: Postoperative delirium after vascular surgery is frequent.	0.4997613724659447
Patients undergoing aortic surgery, with specific concomittant medical disease, psychopathological disturbances and a severe intraoperative course, are at risk of developing postoperative delirium.	0.6556338819411137
This report summarizes our experiences with the subjective visual vertical (SVV) as a clinical neuro-otological tool.	0.6554515534032347
In the SVV test, patients have to orient a dim light bar in an otherwise dark surrounding earth-vertical, using a remote-control.	0.546572987412164
Normal subjects in an upright position did not deviate more than 2 ° from true vertical.	0.37819207436153696
After vestibular neurectomy, the SVV was consistently tilted by some 12 ° toward the affected ear.	0.4698074742451525
Smaller tilts (~7 °) of the SVV occured in patients with spontaneous peripheral vestibular diseases.	0.7771304709994301
This shift in SVV disappeared within weeks to months, similar to the spontaneous nystagmus.	0.5040886421769964
After stapes surgery slight deviations of the SVV towards the unoperated ear were seen in about 20% of the patients, indicating a slight irritation of the otolith organs.	0.6156510811693565
Assessed in an upright position, the SVV thus may be regarded as reflecting tonic otolithic input differences between the two ears.	0.6290689503101057
Introduction: Vocal cord paralysis is a important complication in thyroid gland surgery.	0.36427408573247066
A prospective study was conducted ascertain the frequency of laryngeal nerve palsy not caused by surgical trauma.	0.6646196582606042
Patients and Methods: Two hundred and ten patients were investigated laryngoscopically pre- and postoperatively after short-term intubation in the course of operations far removed from thorax or neck region.	0.5948061387454158
We noted the inner diameter of the tube, intubation problems, the qualification of the anaesthesiologist and the positioning of the patient.	0.7069058749413901
Results: Preoperatively we found previously unknown unilateral laryngeal nerve palsy in 1.9 % of cases.	0.693080742649824
Postoperatively there were pathological findings of vocal cords in 13 patients (6.2 %).	0.6409438131032674
In 10 patients a direct lesion (oedema, rubor, haematoma, granuloma) was established.	0.6005650132953451
Three patients (1.4 %) were found to have a movement disorder caused by a neural lesion without morphological findings, leading to restitutio ad integrum in two of three cases after 6 months.	0.7668819044216316
Conclusion: The frequency of intubation-related recurrent nerve palsy is 1.4 % transiently and 0.5 % permanently.	0.6658985503446767
Preoperative laryngoscopic investigation of vocal cords should be carried out before intubation.	0.35790907350568
Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) are the most frequent infections cause of genital ulcerations.	0.8511724827506199
Although genital infections by HSV-1 are increasing HSV-2 is dominant in recurrent infections.	0.4086141123775838
This study was conducted on a panel of sera collected anonymously in 1996 and 1997 from blood donors (1979 samples) and hospital patients (3079 samples) without risk factors for herpesvirus infections such as STD, other infectious diseases and immunosuppression.	0.6669371330342828
Serum samples were tested with ELISAs using monoclonal antibody-selected native gG1 and gG2 as antigens and an immunoblot using type-specific recombinant glycoproteins.	0.3470461677502528
Equivocal results were confirmed with an in-house Western blot.	0.43917985499168494

We report on three family members suffering from both autosomal dominant Hailey-Hailey disease and bipolar affective disorder.	0.5128861157741482
As molecular biology techniques have made the localization of genes causing simple Mendelian traits possible as a routine task, the gene for Hailey-Hailey disease will presumably be localized in the foreseeable future.	0.5528235607499428
The Hailey-Hailey gene and its chromosomal surrounding will then be a region of interest for linkage studies in bipolar affective disorder.	0.4005282883588019
Background: Osteoporotic fractures occur frequently also in men.	0.35846009804446916
Epidemiologic data from Germany indicate that more than 900,000 men are affected by osteoporotic fractures.	0.4064858566606184
Diagnosis and therapy of male osteoporosis are hampered by a lack of clinical studies.	0.638294846732362
Recurrent headaches and recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) are the most common pain syndromes in childhood: The prevalence of tension headache amounts to 20-50 %, of migraine to 5-7 % and of RAP to 15-30 %.	0.8408401885891645
In nearly 50 % of children the complaints persist over many years of their life-span.	0.6892936648004861
The unfavourable long-term prognosis support the indication of early and specific interventions.	0.6076216774102259
Empirical findings on the etiology, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology are still very limited.	0.5597915436409916
Actual approaches suggest to understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance, and in this context there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial influences.	0.761153258299908
The behavioral-medicine proceeding bases upon an extensive family anamnestic exploration and symptom analysis.	0.26952092006975603
The psychological interventions applied in clinical practice include prophylaxis (stress inoculation, cognitive redefinition, problem solving), reduction of pain symptoms (relaxation, distraction, imagination) and environmental modification (parental reinforcement and modeling behavior).	0.5756813842245242
During the last years there has been an increasing trend to create more complex and multidimensional behavioral pain management programs for children.	0.6072329823715785
The aim of our study was to develop noninvasive stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with choroidal metastases.	0.6026503281881103
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is standard therapy for urolithiasis.	0.5183069441606385
With comparable technical principles, various lithotripters have been developed and are in routine use.	0.6304887325078118
Renal pelvic stones, calyceal stones, ureteral stones, and other special forms can be treated with varying results.	0.6762305674019286
Currently, the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the recurrence of calculi are under discussion.	0.5155087478309817
Whereas the side effects of ESWL are well known, studies comparing ESWL with other endourological procedures are still lacking.	0.5554157280349409
Suramin has long been used in the treatment of onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis.	0.45057012475234565
Recent investigations showed an antiproliferative effect of suramin on prostate carcinoma cell lines.	0.4648760911477113
Ongoing clinical trials have confirmed the effect of suramin on metastasizing prostate carcinoma.	0.50019588367015
Five patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma resistant to classic hormonal therapy were treated with high-dose suramin.	0.6585157360849618
Four of the five developed a papulovesicular or maculopapular rash within 2 - 4 weeks of starting therapy.	0.6211889778073704
The rashes disappeared after discontinuation of suramin within 10 days.	0.29585048193991464
In tumour therapy, high dosages of suramin are used to achieve a serum level of 200 - 300 µg/ml.	0.7358592385723365
Therefore, a toxic reaction to suramin is suspected as the explanation for the skin rashes.	0.5657575936280497
Acetylcholinesterase (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema is supposed to be an uncommon cause for oropharyngeal edema.	0.5971212420373457
Between January 1, 1993 and February 1, 1997 we treated 20 patients with edema of the oropharyngeal region that was not caused by infection or irradiation.	0.5985586699654765
The most common reason was an ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema and occurred in 9 cases, all of whom required inpatient treatment.	0.705304947700529
The medical management consisted of the administra- tion of intravenous (i.v.)	0.5129491487447543
glucocorticosteroids in all cases, H1-blockers in 6 cases, epinephrine by inhalation in one case and i.v.	0.6005502414953567
Tracheostomy had to be performed in one patient.	1.0424237550375706
In our experience it is necessary to reconsider ACE inhibitor-induced angioedma in any case of an oropharyngeal edema.	0.647450836624069
However, there is no reason for the routine application of epinephrine in these cases.	0.8739952818245742
After treatment of more than 3000 kidney and ureteral stones with the Siemens Lithostar Multiline the results of the first 1400 ureteral stone treatments using the "Booster technique" and 3-month follow-up findings are reported.	0.6964662184640062
There was a disintegration rate of 98 % directly after treatment; 1 week after "Booster technique" treatment 96 % of the patients were free of stones and without any symptoms.	0.746808626373749
The 3-month follow-up showed a stone-free rate of 97 %.	0.6125950790377013
Only in 13 % of the cases auxiliary procedures were neccessary, 7 % of them before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and 6 % after ESWL.	0.8417993320311135
43 % of the treatments were performed without any premedication, anaesthesia or sedoanalgesia.	0.6882229102981212
Our data even prove that in situ ESWL is a safe and effective method for the treatment of ureteral stones.	0.5716135767496314
In comparison to endoscopic procedures, it is superior in regard to invasivity, side effects, complications and neccessity of analgesia, while being just as efficient.	0.6252190433562472
Therefore it is recommended as first choice method in the treatment of ureteral stones.	0.6828968871332839
The perspectives for active hearing implants lie in the treatment of patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).	0.4316706293291748
The majority of patients with SNHL suffer from a cochlea amplifier (CA) failure which is discernible by a positive recruitment and loss of otoacoustic emissions (OAE).	0.5029639799169914
Therefore, the electronic implant is expected to partially replace functions of the CA.	0.6179242359193955
Thus, the implant is thought to function as a CAI (cochlea amplifier implant).	0.6211845938283894
An approved implant for routine use is not yet available.	0.5744306698714471
Clinical studies have thus far only used the high energy consuming (HEC), narrow-band, electromagnetic floating-mass transducer, as well as the Maniglia-HEC implant.	0.48521361139564445
The high energie consuming, yet broadband Canadian Fredrickson implant is soon to be used in humans.	0.5575088474812574
Of the piezoelectrical implants, a German CAI (Tübingen implant) at present consisting of a piezoelectrical transducer and a microphone has thus far been acutely implanted in first patient.	0.5781736113024736
It is a low energy consuming (LEC), broad-band implantable system for patients with sensorineural hearing loss.	0.551300910273184
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) was de-scribed electroclinically by Janz and Christian in 1957 and consists of myoclonic jerks in  varying combination with the absence of seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, a typical circadian distribution on awakening, sleep deprivation, alcohol consumption and flickering stimuli as characteristic precipitating factors, typical EEG abnormalities with generalized epileptiform discharges, normal physical and neuroradiological findings, and often a family history of epilepsy.	0.5361429849087437
Although the misdiagnosis of this well-classified and easily treatable syndrome is supposed to occur rarely in Germany, we retrospectively investigated how often the wrong initial classification had been made among patients who were finally treated in our outpatient epilepsy unit.	0.6118852931618487
Between 1993 and 1995, 30 patients with a typical JME-like symptom constellation were identified who had been misdiagnosed initially.	0.6283077391326793
In all patients, localization-related epilepsy had been classified, although regional EEG abnormalities were rare (n=5).	0.5503186472257318
All patients reported the typical circadian distribution, abnormal neuroradiological findings were absent, and typical EEG abnormalities were present in all cases.	0.7057619396819581
Under treatment with appropiate antiepileptic drugs 97% of the patients became almost completely seizure-free.	0.5811449228658166
Even 40 years after the first description of the syndrome, JME is an underdiagnosed illness.	0.7360589220359759
The generally  positive course underlines the importance of its correct identification.	0.3335182039335041
Background: The aim of the study was to evaluate results of visual acuity and binocularity and complications after cataract surgery with primary capsular bag-fixated IOL implantation in children.	0.6081025201820558
Arterial hypertension is known to be an important risk factor for cerebral and cardiovascular disease.	0.8748790502253762
Previous studies have demonstrated alterations in the perifoveal microcirculation in patients with essential hypertension.	0.5580814898186964
During follow-up a progression of these alterations has been reported.	0.572856681639884
In the present study we quantified the retinal microcirculation of patients with hypertension under different systemic antihypertensive medication.	0.612981384812498
Vaginal and uterine bleeding is a common symptom in gynecology.	0.5204458810442678
The cause of the bleeding should be investigated so as to exclude carcinoma as its origin.	0.6197464340201455
First, the basic circulation parameters should be determined.	0.5739502497262682
Blood volume and oxygen substitution are essential.	0.39558613390100217
Depending on these findings, further diagnostic or therapeutic steps must be undertaken.	0.6198107111270204
If the situation is stable, diagnostic measures are indicated to localize the bleeding and the tumor.	0.6441414645472695
A general examination, including a vaginal and rectal examination, must be performed.	0.6675562701976148
Other diagnostic procedures such as ultrasound (vaginal and transabdominal) and CT or MRI may be required.	0.6229390454189465
If available, an angiography should be performed.	0.5282730102766043
Medium-term results with a follow-up of at least 3 years were done in 160 patients (average follow up 51 months) after ACL reconstruction using IKDC evaluation form and Noyes score and in 110 patients (average follow Up 53 months) after non-operative management.	0.8328677121790451
Unlike objective good parameters the subjective assessment of knee function according to the Noyes score reveals significantly worse results in cases with ACL reconstruction compared to the knees without surgery.	0.5810693986064959
The best functional results we found in professional athletes after ACL reconstruction.	0.4781553184261417
Comparable positive results of knee function is only achieved in approx.	0.5104174365298406
15 % of the patients from the natural history group, who can maintain high risk pivoting activity level feeling no giving way.	0.7240171870256445
In our opinion compensatory proprioceptive mechanism account for the surpassing results in these two groups of patients.	0.7263455660103827
It will be postulated that it is not the absolute power of the hamstring but the latency period of recruition that influences the compensation of anterior knee instability.	0.5908148767966566
We have modified our rehabilitation methods in order to improve proprioception and dynamic stability of the ACL-deficient knee.	0.5242038839449149
Based on our results we primarily limitate the ACL reconstruction on a group of patients practicing high-risk-pivoting sports.	0.7047785683685808
Only when menisceal lesions appear or patients suffer from giving way episodes we support secondary surgery.	0.315651728178381
The pivot shift sign is reflecting the dynamic aspect of knee instability.	0.3117848731797607
In our opinion it is the decisive parameter to assess knee instability unless there are useful technical procederes.	0.6472022054991724
Multiple injuries in elderly patients are still a common problem.	0.9106923534294947
The present study was performed to investigate mortality and complications in multiple trauma patients aged 65 years or more.	0.8074848193829055
A total of 1154 multiple trauma patients with an injury severity score (ISS) of at least 18 points were divided in two age groups: Y: 16 - 64 years, n = 1022; O: 65 - 94 years, n = 132.	0.6821291028785055
Older patients were injured as pedestrians in most cases (69%), while younger patients were more frequently injured as car and drivers passengers (41%).	0.6036430075188769
ISS was comparable in both groups (Y 28 +/- 1, O 27 +/- 1).	0.8475444342363896
During ICU-therapy incidence of ARDS (Y 10%, O 11%), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOF; Y 6%, O 9%) and pneumonia (Y 17%, O 21%) were comparable.	0.7429508517227499
In contrast, septic complications were more frequent in older patients (Y 19%, O 27%).	0.6958839078839536
Length of ICU stay (Y 19 +/- 2, O 18 +/- 1) and ventilation time (Y 14 +/- 2, O 17 +/- 1) were comparable.	0.8347737146602603
Mortality was significantly higher in older patients (Y 15%, O 53%).	0.6797976804011275
The major cause of death was sepsis in older patients (Y 15%, O 31%) and MOF in younger patients (Y 54%, O 29%).	0.7365926264356137
In conclusion, older trauma patients had a higher mortality due to the development of septical complications.	0.6519405148811435
The Raynaud phenomenon occurs in 90-100% of patients with systemic scleroderma.	0.7011121509661936
It is caused by dysregulation of the vascular tone between vasocontrictive and vasodilatory influences.	0.452788479200888
Early damage to the vascular endothelium and the activation of platelets lead to the release of vasoactive substances.	0.5682944094752964
Structural and function impairment of the perivascular neural fibers contributes to the vasospasm.	0.44004562765305927
New vasodilatory treatment strategies, e.g.	0.2732297874709547
infusions with calcitonin gene-related peptides, could be useful in the control of vasospasm in the peripheral extremities as well as internal organs in systemic scleroderma.	0.6277984466007513
Due to the limited efficacy of drug therapy in atrial fibrillation and the high rate of recurrence, strong efforts were made to find non-pharmacological strategies.	0.6854943999126138
For three years now, the implantable atrial defibrillator Metrix from InControl has been available as an alternative therapy.	0.5906953940881698
From October 1995 to the present the atrial defibrillator was implanted in 179 patients worldwide.	0.5317465820803273
The sensitivity of the system and its algorithms to detect atrial fibrillation is 90%; the specifity to detect sinus rhythm is 100%.	0.6769960379479184
In 121 of 179 patients, 748 episodes of spontaneous atrial fibrillation were treated with 2.4 shocks per episode.	0.5746353699018694
No proarrhythmic event or stroke was seen.	0.16806579593692023
A cardioversion to sinus rhythm could be achieved in 95% of patients; the overall clinical success rate was 88%.	0.8285795736586613
In 7% of all patients, early recurrence of atrial fibrillation (ERAF) occurred that could not be converted into stable sinus rhythm after further cardioversions and antiarrhythmic therapy.	0.6979410885818971
In 4.1% there were lead-related complications, in 4 patients the device had to be explanted because of ineffective therapy, and in 3 patients the device had to be changed because of loss of telemetry or early depletion of battery.	0.7343150110066446
In 8 patients, postoperative complications were seen (infections, pneumothorax and thrombosis of the subclavian vein).	0.7173207216578009
Overall, the implantable atrial defibrillator Metrix is an effective and safe alternative in treating atrial fibrillation.	0.7362205570632514
Background: The success rate of combined glaucoma and small incision cataract surgery is not yet established.	0.7514056372176554
The somatosensory system of preterms and newborns differs substantially from adults.	0.2968986143420146
These differences are of considerable preclinical and clinical interest.	0.38382193302503964
Maturation of A- and C-fibre synaptic connections in the dorsal horn and development of descending inhibition from the brainstem all take place postnatally in the rat.	0.5730739035866714
In early stages of development there is no definite spatial sepraration in the dorsal horn between the nociceptive and the non-nociceptive system.	0.6069495372435447
In preterms but not in adults non-noxious stimuli can induce central sensitization.	0.4034620280759446
Many neurotransmitters and signalling molecules involved in pain pathways are expressed early in the developing nervous system but do not reach adult levels for a considerable period.	0.41153212481101037
More important, receptors are frequently transiently overexpressed or expressed in areas during development where they are not seen in the adult and may have a different functional profile.	0.5686133127368929
The descending pain inhibitory system that provides an important protection against central sensitization developes later than the ascending nociceptive system.	0.4012448314884872
Thus, during a critical period of time the immature nociceptive system is highly vulnerable.	0.752408481412373
For example, neonatal circumcision in the absence of analgesia results in increased pain responses during subsequent routine vaccination months later.	0.3628716392421178
Numerous studies conducted during the past decades indicate that the public's attitude toward the mentally ill is strongly prejudiced.	0.502501480151928
Since the attitude of the general public also has an effect on community-based psychiatric care, we must ask how public opinion might be influenced.	0.6007633964107694
One possible approach could be through so-called key community leaders - those who are highly respected in society because of their competence in a particular area.	0.5493784501435234
Doctors belong to this group of people.	0.48090396742689445
For this reason we questioned medical students, as future key community leaders, with respect to their attitudes toward the mentally ill within the framework of their first contact with psychiatric patients during their studies.	0.604333339649398
In order to make a direct comparison possible, we interviewed a sample of the Mannheim population who live in a part of the city where a variety of complementary facilities have been set up.	0.5666101703448972
The comparison shows that medical students do not have a more positive attitude toward the mentally ill; in fact, in certain areas they have an even more negative attitude toward the mentally ill than the general population has.	0.6306188902216562
We were not able to establish what effect teaching has with respect to changing attitudes.	0.31437897729802544
Systematic lymphadenectomy for colorectal cancer aims to remove potentially metastatic lymph nodes from the tumor's drainage basin.	0.4849988795297771
This requires knowledge of normal lymphatic anatomy and metastatic routes.	0.3918319758211352
Systematic lymphadenectomy performed as a standard or as an extended resection is a prerequisite for pathologic tumor staging.	0.5925305562249171
An intensive search by the pathologist for lymph node metastases is critical for precise staging.	0.4600143914815653
Recommendations as to the extent of lymphadenectomy are derived from potential improvement of prognosis and procedure-related complications.	0.5518981748559592
Life threatening hemorrhage in patients with malignant tumours of the head and neck area are often, as a result of tumour infiltration, postoperative anatomical changes, infection and radiological necrosis, difficult to control.	0.753478226742844
One option for prophylaxis and treatment is the ligature of the external (ECA) or common carotid artery (CCA) and superior thyroid artery (STA).	0.6454972710880118
52 patients were examined in a retrospective study to determine both the hazards and the therapeutic use of the procedure.	0.8979851541996301
The external carotid artery (ECA) was ligated prophylactically during the operative procedure of tumour resection and neck dissection in 25 patients.	0.6361426031806838
In 27 cases closure of the ECA, CCA or ECA and STA was carried out as an emergency procedure for acute hemorrhage following completed primary treatment (operation, primary or postoperative radiation or radiochemotherapy).	0.5873377933992155
There was no postoperative hemorrhage after prophylactic ligature of the ECA.	0.5262505156975629
One patient with multiple cardiovascular diseases suffered from an ipsilateral cerebral infarction 1 year after operation.	0.6306835459028101
In 6 of 9 patients and in all 3 patients, in whom ligature of the CCA or ECA and STA respectively was carried out as an emergency procedure, severe neurological complications up to an apallic syndrome occured.	0.7349013555239756
The number of deaths due to acute hemorrhage was considerably smaller among those patients with prophylactic ligature of the ECA performed during operative procedure of tumor resection and neck dissection.	0.5793668124111258
In addition there were much less unfavourable courses in the sequence of prophylactic closure of the ECA than observed after ligating the CCA or ECA and STA in an emergency situation.	0.5258992719506895
The carcinoid tumor of the middle ear is a very rare neoplasm which in general is regarded as benign but may be mistaken for an adenocarcinoma because of its histological heterogeneity.	0.6250252622652831
Typical, however, is its neuroendocrine and mucinous differentiation so that an unequivocal diagnosis is possible by means of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.	0.5823519021048847
As the tumor is very rare, there is no statistical evidence as to whether further treatment is necessary after primary exstirpation of the tumor.	0.7646222190384089
Therefore, a review of the literature was performed.	0.8350129774870257
We report about a 28-year-old male patient with a carcinoid tumor of the left tympanic cavity.	0.7577777062036019
Without any further treatment there has been no evidence for either recurrence or metastases 32 months after surgical resection.	0.6536189599124974
As treatment of choice we recommend conservative surgery with complete removal of the tumor and a clinical follow-up on a regular basis.	0.7800880245294636
Intraoperative precision in computer-assisted surgery depends on the characteristics of a navigation system, the precision of correlation between object and data set, the position, number and fixation of landmarks, and the parameters of the data set.	0.773887527066945
The characteristics of a navigation system, in particular the immanent precision, can be detected by the use of the geometric model and navigation analyzer developed at the University of Regensburg with the support of Carl Zeiss, Germany.	0.705212781345992
The precision of five navigation systems of different types and technology was measured: Viewing Wand (ISG, mechanical system), the SMN microscope (Carl Zeiss, infrared system with laser autofocus), the MKM system (Carl Zeiss, robot platform with laser autofocus) and the STP pointer (Leibinger, infrared system).	0.5615216119607246
The immanent precision of these systems ranges from 0.1 to 2.0 mm.	0.9779015792991556
An electromagnetic system (3-Space Digitizer, Polhemus) was compared; this produces serious spherical deviations of 10.0 to 20.0 mm in the presence of metal, surgical and rotating instruments, and circuits.	0.7822695921148225
The application of these different systems for craniomaxillofacial surgery is discussed.	0.5111804944493423
The aim of the study was to record retrospectively the events of Pneumocystis carinii-Pneumonia (PCP) among HIV-infected children (<18 years) in Germany.	0.7886433748716201
The patients were evaluated with regard to prophylaxis, course of disease and prognosis.	0.9548863350580974
In this study we looked at the relationship between extracorporal circulation and changes in blood electrolytes.	0.713074217220335
Glucocorticoids are a potent cause of osteoporosis and thus a potential source of substantial morbidity in patients who are already significantly disabled by their underlying condition.	0.5925204069602278
These agent interact with calcium metabolism at many levels; in particular they reduce the osteoblast's synthesis of the principal proteins of bone matrix.	0.5460966169255022
They also reduce circulating sex hormone concentrations, particularly in men and postmenopausal women.	0.5287451412335182
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), which form a rare group of neoplasias of the gastrointestinal tract, have not yet been fully investigated.	0.6299454438252323
Although good progress has been made in their diagnosis, classification of these lesions with regard to their histogenesis and biological behavior remains problematic.	0.6575690669840171
Between 1994 and 1998, 18 GIST patients underwere operation in the Department of Surgery.	0.5002129117050194
Twelve of these patients (67 %) had stromal tumors in the stomach, and six (33 %) had intestinal stromal tumors.	0.8398221225735287
The primary tumor could be removed in all patients with R0 resection.	0.9070813195167132
Six patients developed hematogenous liver metastasis, with the size of their primary tumor exceeding 10 cm.	0.6505320120658846
Extrahepatic distant metastases were not found in any case.	0.6487096066539155
Lymphadenectomy showed that lymph node metastases did not occur.	0.4433304489112815
Histological evaluation was made according to the guidelines of Lewin, Weinstein and Riddell.	0.4304785821339509
Currently established therapy is limited to complete surgical resection of the primary tumor and its metastases.	0.8542134523145128
Adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy approaches have failed.	0.24067556436615586
Acute leptospirosis in Europe (Weil's disease) is a rare and in more than 90 % of the cases undiagnosed febrile, self-limited disease.	0.8028293603012395
We report the case of a 39-year-old sewerage worker, who was admitted to our hospital with fever, jaundice, pain in his calves and acute renal failure.	0.6615592087491037
Serology revealed elevated antibody titers against Leptospira canicola, L. icterhaemorrhagica and L. sejroe.	0.32615463719004956
The patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with diffuse gastrointestinal bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.	0.57934729706723
The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with irregularly irregular rhythm.	0.44668021001225344
Cardiac arrest developed, most likely due to hypoxia, with a drop in the blood pressure.	0.8319430356694129
Despite immediate resuscitation efforts the patient developed severe hypoxic brain damage and died a few days later.	0.6143131616078514
Autopsy disclosed histologic signs of a generalized leptospiral infection, signs of shock and within the lungs a necrotizing herpes simplex virus pneumonia causing the death of the patient.	0.5311571759034002
The virus pneumonia most probably was caused by retrograde canalicular dissemination of oral secretions since herpetic tracheitis and esophagitis were found and herpetic lesions were readily identified on the lips and tongue.	0.4044601423968548
A medical opinion asked for by the professional association having liability for occupational safety and insurance was given, the disease being recognized as an occupational disease.	0.5681854140738936
During the past decade, the molecular mechanisms in the process of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have become better understood.	0.8171882602668753
Cancer metastasis consists of multiple, complex interacting steps.	0.3985616836241244
Each of these steps is crucial and limiting, since a failure to complete any one prevents the tumor cell from producing a metastasis.	0.5463251806156715
Detachment from the solid tumor by loosening the intercellular junctions and proteolysis of the extracellular matrix enables tumor cells to enter blood- and lymph vessels.	0.4787393045504763
The intravasation into the circulation is supported by the secretion of angiogenic factors, which induce degradation of the basal membran in blood vessels.	0.6227834518213443
Adhesion to endothelial cells, extravasation from the circulation, and induction of angiogenesis are further essential steps for completing the metastatic process.	0.48127549132829517
Furthermore, it is well known that once a tumor cell has entered circulation, it will survive only by evasion of the immune system.	0.6604866581349039
The systematic identification of tumor antigens opens up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic approaches.	0.31020169648510665
Hypogonadism is the main indication for testosterone substitution in the ageing male.	0.4655178711672608
The choice of the testosterone preparation should be based on the principle that serum levels of testosterone remain in the normal range and fast termination of therapy is possible.	0.6057863053100337
To date, transdermal testosterone systems appear to be best suited for substitution therapy in the ageing male.	0.44195542627360423
Future promising developments are testosterone gels and intramuscular testosterone undecanoate.	0.19898208554870206
Any testosterone therapy in the ageing male has to be monitored closely, especially regarding erythropoiesis and the prostate.	0.619898847667926
Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a disease that involves the lining of joints, bursae and tendon sheaths.	0.5318207846131077
The incidence is low and estimated to be 1.8 patients per million population.	0.6291152303898591
The cause of PVNS is unclear and discussed to be either inflammatory or neoplastic.	0.4638292589063404
PVNS has been described in 2 forms different for prognosis and treatment (nodular and diffuse).	0.5634210249013447
The articular form almost appeares in the knee joint as we describe below in a 14 year-old patient.	0.6030253072283341
In this retrospective study, 13 patients with subtle Lisfranc joint injuries were examined after a mean period of 23 months using clinical assessment, radiography and dynamic pedographic gait analysis.	0.5135389816607219
The aims were to identify the factors leading to a mobile flatfoot deformity, evaluate the functional and clinical outcome of these injuries, and draw practical conclusions for initial management and subsequent intervention.	0.6211280685222811
All patients showed a mobile flatfoot deformity, increased motion in the subtalar joint, increased load on the hindfoot, decreased load on the forefoot, and a prolonged contact phase during the stance phase.	0.7393879002430718
Radiographs revealed progressive osteoarthrosis in the joint and a residual displacement of the medial Lisfranc joint.	0.5975469832412841
An unstable medial Lisfranc joint results in the development of a mobile flatfoot.	0.6685708444942694
Initial treatment of a subtly displaced Lisfranc joint should consist of exact anatomical reduction and additional maintenance of the longitudinal arch of the foot.	0.5257929017065964
After failed initial treatment, early arthrodesis of the midfoot is recommended as a salvage procedure for the foot.	0.6734102604598198
Cross-sectional imaging with CT and MRI plays an indispensable complementary role to endoscopy in the pretherapeutic workup and staging of laryngeal neoplasms.	0.5149419185575469
Adequate interpretation of the CT and MR images requires a thorough knowledge of the patterns of submucosal spread and familiarity with the diagnostic signs of neoplastic invasion as seen with each modality.	0.5598440671864287
In addition, the radiologist should be aware of the implications of imaging for staging and treatment.	0.5160233107451685
Both CT and MR imaging are highly sensitive for the detection of neoplastic invasion of the pre-epiglottic space, paraglottic space, subglottic region and cartilage.	0.5104447266327524
The high negative predictive value of both CT and MRI allows exclusion of neoplastic cartilage invasion quite reliably.	0.4938445001241275
The specificity of both CT and MRI is, however, limited and both methods may therefore overestimate the extent of tumor spread.	0.6024670846935719
Nevertheless, both cross-sectional imaging methods significantly improve the pretherapeutic staging accuracy of laryngeal tumors if used in addition to clinical examination and endoscopic biopsy.	0.6857769811188648
In the presence of a submucosal mass, CT and MRI play a key role for the diagnosis, as they may characterize the lesion, reliably depict its submucosal extent, and guide the endoscopist to perform deep biopsies that allow a definitive histological diagnosis.	0.658588644420747
Background: HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology.	0.5013252508812739
Organ culture storage leads to loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells.	0.37066147011633255
This study investigates the importance of prolonged storage period for the success rate after penetrating keratoplasty.	0.6042412803071778
Ergotamine-containing drugs are widely used in the treatment of acute migraine attacks.	0.5933301204912885
Among others, spastic vasoconstrictions are one of the possible side effects usually affecting the lower extremities and sometimes leading to gangrene.	0.522498170489151
The case of a 75 year old woman is presented who was suffering from migraine-attacks since adolescence.	0.613574241806266
Due to longterm use of ergotamine containing suppositories she developed perianal ulcers.	0.2666242277819716
After withdrawl of the drug the ulcers healed up entirely.	0.4832865490023345
The spectrum of ergotamine-induced side-effects and possible intervention strategies are discussed.	0.5586334403530342
In this article, a model of quality assurance for inpatient psychotherapy is discussed, which was developed in cooperation between researchers and clinicians.	0.7946780622647495
This model is based on the concept of internal quality assurance with external help.	0.5910780175051968
The Heidelberg Model of Active Internal Quality Assurance has three elements: (1.)	0.6375946452074812
a QA-Inventory for routine monitoring; (2.)	0.6723580408118631
rules for evaluating the outcome of every patient and (3.)	0.8458349323607741
a feedback model for communicating the results to the therapists (quality circles).	0.4363961848900635
The focus of this model is the recognition of problematic results.	0.5755060123297737
It is mainly these results that will be discussed in our quality circles, where the outcome of treatments from the perspective of the inventory and of the therapists are discussed.	0.6966416355934346
This feedback model and the quality circles will be explained with three examples of patients.	0.5066466028371093
The Heidelberg Model of Active Internal Quality Assurance will be seen as the basis of a concept of Quality Assurance, which is aimed at assuring and improving the quality and rationality of the psychotherapeutic service.	0.6899089549641834
Aims: In this study the technique of intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier block) was evaluated as an experimental tool to differentiate peripheral and central effects of analgesics.	0.8128253296439872
A pre-term infant weighing 900 g, gestational age 25 weeks, developed an acute abdomen.	0.5162402631975189
Intravenous lines had been inserted previously in the left (silasticcatheter) and right (24 G cannula) saphenous veins in the neonatal intensive care unit.	0.6455038543855022
During surgical exploration, a perforation of the terminal ileum was found.	0.5661399440701165
The operation consisted in partial resection of the perforated ileum with an end-to-end anastomosis and a double-lumen colostomy.	0.46532810916018397
Major blood loss during the procedure caused serious haemodynamic problems.	0.47798683473934195
Despite transfusion of erythrocyte (100 ml), thrombocytes (75 ml), and albumin (50 ml), the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension.	0.8230747194762673
Administration of atropine, adrenaline, and calcium IV had no effect.	0.5009442053512015
The operation could be finished only with extrathoracic resuscitation.	0.308604819590497
When the drapes were removed, livid, swollen lower limbs raised the suspicion of an acute thrombosis of the inferior vena cava.	0.5275747962064468
After insertion of a 24 G IV cannula into a vein of the right upper arm, the circulation stabilised after rapid transfusion of 40 ml blood and 25 ml thrombocytes and resuscitation was successful.	0.6139759528856192
Paediatricians and anaesthesiologists must consider the risk of thrombosis of the vena cava.	0.508309678238369
If venous lines in the lower limbs are not visible to the anaesthesiologist during the operation, venipuncture of veins of an upper limb is recommended before starting the surgical procedure.	0.6159972319346317
Due to the high incidence of vena cava thrombosis caused by central venous lines and the difficulty of peripheral venipuncture in pre-termintanty, a safe venous line should be inserted if necessary by pre-operative venesection.	0.577985511450541
While complementary medicine and homeopathy is becoming an increasingly prominent part of the health care practices, there is a lack of controlled studies concerning their effectiveness.	0.5834501364130594
In our study, we wanted to answer the question whether a combination of Formica rufa D6 and reinjection of the patient's own blood is superior to injection of placebo.	0.6927769519935142
104 patients with ankylosing spondylitis entered a prospective, randomized, double-blind study.	0.43142257703031295
During four weeks they received twice weekly either 1 ml of Formica rufa D6 in combination with 0.5 ml of blood or 1.5 ml NaCl intramuscular.	0.7004287864458191
Before and after therapy, mobility, thoracic excursion and doctor's overall assessment were measured in addition to patient's health status, using a German version of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales, before and after therapy as well as four, twelve, and twentyfour weeks later.	0.703954373943965
We were not able to detect any statistical difference between treatment and placebo group in any of the parameters measured.	0.5843178903481828
Therefore, the therapy under study may not be regarded effective.	0.6394312695160576
A 32-year-old man was accused of attempted rape.	0.5010746350630232
While urinating at the side of the road he felt an erection.	0.355694056209606
He approached a 9-year-old girl who happened to be coming along and pressed his penis between her legs until ejaculation.	0.4474910942078521
Shortly afterwards he was arrested.	0.1873856218648545
He confessed, but claimed partial amnesia and had no explanation for the offence, which he normally would never have thought of.	0.5571209212237217
Shortly before the event a witness had seen him nearby in a poor state of orientation.	0.36243662715858077
Three months later in prison he suffered massive subarachnoidal hemorrhage from an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery.	0.5361037638047776
The evaluation of his legal responsibility must take account of a putative psychomotor seizure at the time of the offence.	0.5144938072503338
With regard to the aneurysm diagnosed later, a pathogenetic connection, in terms of a preceding warning leak, might be assumed.	0.6540804064686292
We present a 43-year-old patient who has had up to 15 frontal lobe seizures nightly for 12 years.	0.594446749896956
The patient had no complaints apart from excessive daytime sleepiness.	0.5480774701254331
Neurological and psychiatric examination as well as cerebral computed tomograph and magnetic resonance imaging were normal.	0.4663409229050742
After sleep deprivation an interictal electro-encephalogram demonstrated a recurrent excess of theta activity over the right frontal and frontopolar area.	0.3317785280380655
A cerebral PET study showed diminished glucose metabolism of the right cingular and frontomesial region.	0.5043723443197479
The sleep structure was extremely fragmented.	0.22453908880628856
There was an excessive reduction of slow-wave sleep and REM sleep.	0.4958029166148711
Carbamazepine therapy produced complete seizure control lasting a few weeks, followed by return of up to 8 seizures per night.	0.41211800670787846
Vigabatrin as add on therapy diminished the noctural seizures to 1 to 3 per night.	0.35758725677974923
Introduction: We attempted to optimize the determination of energy expenditure and substrate utilisation in VLBW infants for practical use in a tertiary care center.	0.494065996801393
The influence of measuring conditions upon results as well as of caloric intake and food composition on substrate utilisation and growth were investigated.	0.4638189900678144
We report a truck driver with severe soft tissue contusion of both legs who developed atypical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) after a thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin; despite a thrombosis the patient showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin in combination with elevation of thrombocytes and positive heparin-dependent antibodies.	0.6177185613190783
Six days after the initial trauma deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and fasciotomy was performed, preventing an imminent compartment syndrome.	0.7211130899579643
Another 5 days later the patient developed exanthema of the trunk and upper extremities and urticaria on his face, as well as severe headache.	0.6739388666825876
His platelet count increased from 134 000/µl to 258 000/µl.	0.31942262449574665
After exclusion of other causes for these symptoms, a reaction to heparin-dependent antibodies (heparin-platelet-factor 4 complex) was demonstrated 2 days later.	0.696869856962512
Thrombosis prophylaxis was changed to hirudin (Refludan) and elevation of thrombocytes to 445 000/µl was noted.	0.49465726022735795
Shortly after rinsing of an intravenous line with less than 50 IE unfractionated heparin at day 36 after trauma the patient developed an anaphylactic shock, which could be managed with cortisone.	0.6416012054101655
We suggest that in HIT the thrombocytopenia may represent only one form of an allergic reaction to heparin.	0.5261633861029067
The cause of the thrombembolic event is an antigen-antibody reaction to heparin taking place on the surface of the thrombocyte.	0.5706047580540851
This is similar in all forms of systemic reaction to heparin application, even though the symptoms may vary.	0.7097962289016939
As thrombocytopenia may not be the main symptom of a heparin-induced antibody reaction - in our hospital only 5 of 10 patients with HIT - the disease should rather be named "heparin allergy".	0.8516697514599698
We suggest a new classification of different pattern of heparin allergy types I-IV.	0.5416427380700186
The new types I and II are similar to HIT types I and II.	0.45900913204816773
Type III is the reaction of antibodies without decrease of thrombocytes, and type IV the reaction of antibodies associated with systemic allergic symptoms.	0.5570011740129192
In recent years, lengthening the human mandible by distraction osteogenesis has become an accepted treatment to correct severe mandibular hypoplasia.	0.48634295417737405
Using intraoral unidirectional and extraoral bidirectional distraction devices we report about our experiences and results in the application of the bone distraction technique in four selected cases of syndromal disease, including various forms of mandibular hypoplastic malformations.	0.6815879818770111
The patients involved were a boy with Pierre Robin syndrome, a girl with unilateral facial hypoplasia in Goldenhar's syndrome, a case with Nager's syndrome, and a rare case of midline deficiency caused by partial deletion of chromosome 18 (18p-syndrome).	0.6406479525835108
The distraction period lasted from 6 to 30 days and new bone formation, ranging from 6 to 28 mm, was achieved.	0.6583811966878611
Real leg length discrepancies may be cosmetically disturbing and lead to gait abnormalities, pelvic obliquity with subsequent lumbar scoliosis as well as functional disturbances of hip, knee and ankle joint.	0.4932313443808127
Morbidity and mortality after reversal of Hartmann's procedure following perforated sigmoid diverticulitis are high and the rate of intestinal restoration is low.	0.5098011077046843
Aim: To investigate whether laparoscopically assisted reversal of Hartmann's procedure is technically feasible and whether the laparoscopic procedure offers any benefit to the patient.	0.6156634329190409
Method: Nineteen patients were investigated.	0.4711516574250464
The postoperative course was followed prospectively.	0.5191556507178656
All patients were reinvestigated 9 months after surgery.	0.6713987279804816
Results: Laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann's procedure was attempted in 19 patients.	0.5146780801714244
One patient did not want the laparoscopic technique.	0.3895466973430075
In two cases (11 %) conversion to the conventional technique was necessary; thus, 16 patients were operated laparoscopically.	0.7947823861948985
Median operative time was 114 (65-180) min.	0.6084661669976918
With the exception of three wound infections no immediate postoperative complications were noticed.	0.4281718414842324
Patients' convalescence was fast.	0.20275798098784956
First evacuation took place 3.3 (3-5) days after surgery, complete oral nutrition 3.6 (3-5) days after surgery.	0.9919214499584681
Duration of postoperative hospitalisation was 7.5 (5-12) days.	0.882507969005602
One patient developed later a clinically significant anastomotic stricture which needed endoscopic dilatation.	0.4158826393288183
Conclusion: Laparoscopically assisted Hartmann's reversal is technically demanding but feasible.	0.3771363968692935
Postoperative morbidity is low, duration of hospitalisation short, convalescence fast.	0.449138798376153
Thus, good arguments exist for performing reversal of Hartmann's procedures laparoscopically.	0.4700793766454921
Mechanical ventilation is a well-etablished strategy in intensive care medicine.	0.566894022658241
ICU trauma patients require analgesia, and sedation mostly consists of benzodiazepines and opioids with increasing doses over time.	0.501033416344913
The weaning period is complicated by the withdrawal syndrome, showing tachycardia, hypertonia, tachypnea and restlessness.	0.4669475585628991
Although treatment with clonidine can influence these symptoms, tachypnea still remains the main problem in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation.	0.5273168092784134
Adding sufentanil, an opioid with greater effects on analgesia than on respiratory depression compared with fentanyl, tachypnea can be reduced to normal frequency.	0.6108618859419195
In this way weaning management can be managed more easily for the benefit of both, the patient and physician.	0.903377982517761
In comparison with a group of 50 patients treated with clonidine alone, 72 patients treated with clonidine/sufentanil showed a shorter period from the start of spontaneous ventilation until extubation (4.8 vs 7.6 days) and until discharge from the ICU (7.7 vs 12.4 days).	0.8396889012036195
The number of reintubations caused by respiratory exhaustion decreased from 16.0 to 2.8 %.	0.5629004812928421
Background: With regard to penetrating keratoplasty methods to culture corneal donor tissues, microsurgical techniques, HLA typing and understanding of basic mechanisms in inflammation and especially graft rejection, and postoperative treatment schedules have been improved in recent years.	0.5973343715342561
This now enables successful penetrating keratoplasty in many more patients than previously performed.	0.33768876774780965
However, in rare cases relevant problems in wound closure may appear.	0.5762543972646911
The occurrence of a new influenza virus subtype in 1997 in Hongkong caused only minor outbreaks due to the swift and determined actions of the institutions involved.	0.47481812119480477
However, this incident again made it clear that an influenza pandemic is still a pending threat.	0.5817035604287707
As a result the WHO presented a pandemic preparedness plan which is to facilitate the global measures taken to fight an imminent or ongoing pandemic.	0.5311649292183778
Strong efforts of influenza surveillance and the coordination of worldwide measures are essential to this plan.	0.4240528209356173
Furthermore the WHO suggested the developement and introduction of similar national preparedness plans.	0.33193602013462187
Given the high mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock, immunomodulation has been considered as an attractive adjunct therapy.	0.5700122342618749
Many agents have been studied that have the therapeutic potential to interfere with cytokines and other pathways which are activated during sepsis.	0.46329857806323144
Drugs having the properties to neutralize lipopolysaccharides have also been considered.	0.3216253198830573
So far all the large clinical trials with immunomodulating agents (HA1A, E5, anti TNF antibodies, ILra) have been shown to be of marginal or of no benefit.	0.6290733645833726
In certain trials results were indecisive, or mortality was increased which led to discontinue the studies.	0.47772347456638364
In certain other trials, like those on antibodies against TNF, some positive effects were seen in subcategories of patients.	0.6395081580169644
Thus, new trials are on their ways.	0.5708178802421295
So far the results of early trials has forced investigators to re-examine the concept of immunomodulation, and to redefine strategies to optimally use agents in a way that benefits the host, while not putting him at risk.	0.6281450194260341
Recently, percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) has become more frequent, since the technique can be mastered relatively easily.	0.7584996423319973
PDT is neither time-consuming nor does it require much personell or material.	0.37187075029128314
Our study seeks to evaluate PDT in terms of its effectivness and practicality on a cardio-surgical ICU.	0.34972609516719155
Recently, two new halogenated volatile anaesthetics, sevoflurane and desflurane, have been approved for clinical use in Germany.	0.7274367298967291
Their low solubility in blood is the most important common property, and this represents the most obvious difference from the inhalational anaesthetics currently used.	0.6873427148752043
Extensive clinical and experimental evaluations have confirmed the superior pharmacokinetic properties predicted.	0.45686407601095974
Both sevoflurane and desflurane provide more rapid emergence from anaesthesia, permit easier titration of the anaesthetic dose during maintenance and offer more rapid recovery from anaesthesia.	0.3917662669090129
For sevoflurane, there are additional advantages: a pleasant odor, negligible airway irritation, and excellent pharmacodynamic characteristics that even provide cardiovascular stability comparable to isoflurane.	0.556093411618432
A certain disadvantage and source of potential nephrotoxicity result from the metabolism of sevoflurane (2-5%) to anorganic fluoride and degradation to compound A in carbon dioxide absorbents.	0.6324268444844698
The extensive clinical data reported to date have revealed no evidence that sevoflurane has adverse renal effects.	0.5823595097976464
New insight into the pathomechanism of nephrotoxicity associated with either production of fluoride or compound A may well support clinical experience.	0.38839853503442967
Desflurane strongly resists in vivo metabolism and because of this it appears to be devoid of toxicity.	0.38724956162182717
Nevertheless, potential side-effects may result from degradation in dry absorbents and subsequent release of CO, from its extreme pungency and irritating airway effects.	0.5212133928671012
Thus, desflurane is not recommended for induction of anaesthesia, especially in children.	0.7089441037236658
The tendency for desflurane transiently to stimulate sympathetic activity, especially at concentrations above 1.0 MAC, limits its application in patients with cardiac disease.	0.6528634314418361
The doctor in charge, who is generally the medical director, is liable if patients suffer harm through organizational faults within his or her department.	0.5628312275609609
Even the suspicion that an error has arisen as the result of defective organization is enough for the person responsible - that is to say the medical director - to be liable.	0.7018060445544623
For this reason, the doctor in charge must be in a position to recognize structural defects in organization and to correct these by means of staff training.	0.5725840444275915
Every training measure must guarantee specialist standards; this means that the work of doctors with no specialist training and those still in training and working under supervision is guaranteed to be of the same standard and performed with the same degree of meticulous care as that of a qualified specialist.	0.661233396899852
A legally valid consent from the patient and documentation of the patient information must be accessible at all times.	0.7097317269780858
Operations carried out by doctors in training must be supervised by a qualified specialist; otherwise the doctor in charge is guilty of a defect in organization.	0.4919928775971693
Because of staff shortages it often happens that inexperienced beginners - often doctors doing their practical training - are on call very early on.	0.5468998423710583
In the high-risk specialty of obstetrics it is particularly important that doctors still undergoing practical training can call on an experienced colleague for help at all times.	0.5467880705261491
The changeover from day duty to emergency duty must be organized by the doctor in charge in such a way that the medical staff are rested and that adequate free time is guaranteed.	0.45571267636684387
There must be no friction when cooperation with other disciplines concerned is needed.	0.33443397953915976
Each sector must know its own area of responsibility.	0.25762603767863823
The doctor in charge is resonsible for seeing that his or her staff members are familiar with the use of the medical equipment.	0.5033826948822255
Uniform guidelines will make it possible for the medical director to train his/her staff and prevent systematic organizational defects.	0.48882372915417044
Georg Friedrich Stromeyer (1804- 1876) is generally known as one of the founders of orthopedics and orthopedic surgery and also made many contributions to modern military medicine.	0.48692331248675025
Furthermore, every oral and maxillofacial surgeon in Germany knows him because of the "Stromeyer hook", which is used for elevation of zygomatic arch fractures.	0.6910981245646347
This special aspect as well as Stromeyer's biography is presented in this article from the history of medicine.	0.5846753452665949
Changes in clinical presentation of Crohn's disease (CD), patients' age at the time of disease manifestation and operation, general condition and duration of medical management were investigated in a retrospective study.	0.7397999148436627
395 operations for CD were divided into consecutive groups and analysed.	0.3549274275418095
In an increasing number of cases patients presented with the "fibrostenotic type" rather than the "fistulizing type" of complaints.	0.7000664363450539
The duration of disease and of medical management increased.	0.7461381597147546
Patients in later groups were younger and in better general condition.	0.34507312180659033
We found a rise in frequency of patients with recurrent CD or prior abdominal surgery for other reasons.	0.6205808381692279
Primary surgery for CD increasingly consisted of resection of solitary segments of gut; in the case of recurrence, of multiple, minimal resections.	0.6563512233730961
The average total length of the resected intestine could be significantly reduced.	0.5070448731486494
The complication rate was equal in elective and emergency surgery.	0.492016019085649
Even among the uncommon aneurysms of the visceral arteries the aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery is considered a rarity.	0.4691591227995676
Etiologically, numerous factors must be taken into account, the most significant one being arteriosclerosis.	0.7526250806734676
The clinical presentation is unspecific and ambiguous.	0.5359808779702436
CT and, above all, intra-arterial DSA allow for a diagnosis.	0.5229589579574507
A generous consideration of indicating operative intervention, even in asymptomatic patients, is especially justified because of the imminent risk of rupture.	0.6791892412018926
The preferrable therapy consists of elimination of the aneurysm either conventionally by proximal and distal ligature of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery or endovascularly by embolization.	0.447148967760114
In the future a treatment with coated stents (TPEG) would also seem possible.	0.6119931520363574
Special attention must be paid to concomitant occlusive disease in other visceral arteries since measures for vessel reconstruction may be required because of intraoperative impairment of the collateral circulation.	0.49878603322843695
We report on the rupture of an aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal inferior artery in association with celiac axis occlusion.	0.6216943291051682
Background: Clinical courses of eight patients with urea cycle disorders (deficiencies of carbamylphosphate-synthetase (4), argininosuccinate-synthetase (2) and argininosuccinate-lyase (2) ) are described.	0.6617007303056072
Methods/Therapy: Emergency treatment consisted of benzoate and arginine i. v. as well as peritoneal dialysis and/or modified hemodialysis.	0.5150110848546275
Chronic treatment comprised a low-protein diet and substitution of essential amino acids, of benzoate or phenylbutyrate and of branched-chain amino acids.	0.47913966603345803
Results: Within 72 hours after birth hyperammonemic coma with cerebral edema developed, leading to developmental retardation later in life.	0.4294136983685628
Four patients died between 2 weeks and 4 years of age.	0.6423295513737183
During follow-up, all patients suffered hyperammonemic derangements treated conservatively.	0.6103337451146427
Phenylbutyrate had less gastrointestinal side-effects than benzoate, branched-chain amino acids had favourable effects.	0.3918413743919435
One patient was treated conservatively since birth followed by a normal development.	0.7058511368932877
Conclusions: Neonatal respiratory distress with alkalosis and rapid global deterioration should raise the suspicion of a urea cycle disorder.	0.3776327985518256
Specific therapy as described can be life-saving, although most children exhibit marked developmental delay.	0.5586141130860058
Sodium phenylbutyrate has fewer side-effects than sodium benzoate.	0.43387235329384666
Therapy prior to cerebral edema can prevent complications.	0.3562337685076224
Pronounced osteoporosis of and surrounding the acetabulum commonly leads to early loosening of endoprosthetic hip replacements following implantation.	0.325468509980581
Large osseous defects in the subimplant bed are the result and the reason why multiple revisions of loosened acetabular cups have to be performed so often in rheumatic surgery.	0.5466142917128599
The defects extend from the cranial to the central; ventral and dorsal anchorage losses may occur in addition to this.	0.5852446724792266
The anchorage of a new implant must be adapted to the individual circumstances.	0.7042925145865936
The new implant must be selected in accordance with point of surgical access, the patient's general status and osseous regenerationability.	0.7164069010202395
In the optimum case, osseous buildup of lost anatomical structures is the preferred method.	0.3786129439400325
If this is not possible, special implants, mostly custom-made prostheses, have to be incorporated.	0.8414666016266782
However, the survival time of the implants is much shorter than in patients with degenerative diseases.	0.8810853876618294
In patients with progressive muscular dystrophy (PMD) invasive electrophysiologic studies can detect hidden intracardiac conduction disturbances.	0.4711894128579659
The aim of this study was a long-term follow-up of these patients.	0.8190762613948851
Twelve consecutive patients (9m, 3f, age 28 +/- 4 yrs) without cardiac symptoms and with normal echocardiographic findings were included in the study.	0.664029881642584
They suffered from different stages of PMD type Erb (n=4), Becker-Kiener (n=4), Duchenne (n=2) and Landouzy-Déjerine (n=2).	0.361442288529519
At the beginning of the study all patients underwent an invasive electrophysiologic study (EPS).	0.6874167656940345
The follow-up of 5.5 yrs included regular clinical visits, ECGs, and Holter recordings (every 3 months) as well as an echocardiography every 6 months.	0.646085099464352
In 4 patients the EPS revealed a hidden interatrial conduction disturbance (AHRS-ACS 120 +/- 18ms), and in 10 pts an infrahisian conduction disturbance was found (HV max.	0.5583414280451927
Conduction defects were seen independently from the type of PMD and the stage of the disease.	0.5036712703354106
During the follow-up the initially hidden interatrial conduction disturbance became evident in the surface ECG in 2 of 4 pts.	0.5497856872477112
One of them developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.	0.45104298467155857
Five of 10 pts with an initially hidden infrahisian conduction disturbance developed an AV block grade I-III and in one case additionally a bundle branch block.	0.5630752752609209
Four of these pts - whose PMD showed progression or who developed congestive cardiomyopathy - needed pacemaker implantation because of a first-degree AV block + bifascicular bundle branch block (n=1), a Mobitz II second-degree AV block (n=1) or a third-degree AV block (n=2).	0.612377882703662
None of the pts with normal findings at the EPS showed abnormal p-waves, an AV block, or an intraventricular conduction disturbance during the follow-up.	0.5832539360033319
We conclude that intracardiac conduction disturbances, especially infrahisian defects including high-degree AV blocks, are a common finding in pts with PMD.	0.7323677005589742
Therefore a regular cardiological screening including an ECG and a Holter recording is reasonable in these patients.	0.37842440699922947
Accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional decline in the core temperature below 35 °C and is caused by exposure to cold, drugs, endocrine dysfunction, central nervous system disorders, skin disorders, and trauma.	0.5968164359577398
Depending on the degree of hypothermia, there is a progressive depression of metabolism in each organ system with specific alterations.	0.6316690028857528
Bone is among the most common sites of metastatic disease in cancers of the breast, prostate, and lung.	0.7657918070086436
The decision about systemic therapy depends on the histology, presence and extent of extraskeletal disease, and the performance status of the patient.	0.7559859654579945
For patients with estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer or prostate cancer, hormonal treatment represents the treatment of choice.	0.610460449451395
In estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer, and for patients who have failed hormonal therapy or have liver metastases, chemotherapy should be initiated.	0.7581600397570041
All patients with small-cell lung cancer should receive chemotherapy.	0.5552542800733583
Bone metastases of differentiated thyroid cancers can be treated with radioisotopes.	0.5473909707884709
In non-small-cell lung cancer or renal cell cancer, systemic chemotherapy should be confined to younger patients and patients in good general condition.	0.6268628238138982
Radiologic assessment of responses of skeletal metastases to systemic therapy is often difficult.	0.5807144173225345
New approaches in measuring bone metabolites in urine might prove helpful.	0.35151239357821873
Although most prenatally diagnosed anatomic malformations are best managed after birth, we can presently offer prenatal therapy to an increasing number of fetuses with simple anatomical defects that have predictably devastating developmental consequences.	0.4745737253812395
A condition amenable to prenatal intervention must fulfill a number of conditions.	0.31154047128472523
It must be severe enough to warrant the risks associated with in utero treatment and must be reliably detectable before birth.	0.44285692317606434
Furthermore, the pathophysiology must be reversible by fetal intervention, significantly improving the prognosis over postnatal treatment.	0.5410738885369206
Current indication for prenatal intervention include decompression for obstructive uropathy, temporary tracheal occlusion for congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and tumor debulking for congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung and sacrococcygeal teratoma.	0.5718184196894086
Prenatal repair of myelomeningocele is currently being developed but remains controversial since this is not a lethal malformation.	0.6021990966828554
Maternal safety remains paramount in considering fetal intervention.	0.18281778965640066
The main associated risks are pre-term labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes.	0.42368835089649537
To reduce maternal morbidity and the risk of prematurity, minimally invasive fetoscopic techniques were developed and are increasingly employed.	0.5145339568546249
These developments will in all probability reduce the importance of open fetal surgery in the future.	0.5062644790193744
Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) has become an important cause of severe infection in hospitalized patients all over the world.	0.69051921349756
In Germany a significant increase of nosocomial infections due to MRSA has occurred during the last 10 years.	0.6581076214397671
Especially elderly patients with chronic illnesses are at increased risk of becoming colonized or infected with MRSA.	0.5559211282756094
This report focuses on epidemiology and therapy of MRSA, and on the recommendations concerning management and prevention of spread of MRSA in hospitals and nursing homes.	0.6252827243924685
During general anaesthesia gas climate significantly is improved by performance of low flow techniques.	0.40780150047827196
Gas climatisation, however, markedly also will be influenced by the temperature loss at, and corresponding water condensation within the hoses, factors which are related to the technical design and material of the patient hose system.	0.6479820964478094
The objective of this prospective study was to investigate 1. how anaesthetic gas climatisation during minimal flow anaesthesia is influenced by the technical design of different breathing hose systems in clinical practice.	0.6992737370986785
2. to investigate, whether a sufficient gas climatisation also can be gained with higher fresh gas flows if that hose system is used, proven beforehand to optimally warming and humidifying the anaesthetic gases.	0.5563525977979256
Introduction: Undifferentiated, embryonal sarcoma is a rare malignant tumour of the liver, the incidence of which is highest in children between 6 and 10 years of age (14.1 %).	0.8121855261412171
Among the primary tumours of the liver in childhood it ranks in third place after hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia.	0.508798059893087
Embryonal sarcoma is much rarer in adults.	0.3815718678581447
To our knowledge, only 18 cases have been published in the last 50 years.	0.8637610801623709
Methods and results: We now present the case of a 29-year-old woman with spontaneous rupture of the liver caused by an undifferentiated sarcoma.	0.7237366102145362
Conclusion: This case report illustrates the possibility of an embryonal sarcoma being the reason for spontaneous rupture of the liver.	0.7258388664735094
The management of this case comprised primary tamponade, interventional embolisation of the feeding artery, and secondary resection under stable conditions.	0.6536869438857209
Substance dependency is one of the most frequent disorders, which can be treated successfully by psychotherapy.	0.8245417143907946
However reasons are discussed, why psychotherapists probably hesitate in treating these patients.	0.34814555246157913
Insufficient psychotherapeutic education concerning dependency, structural problems, expected difficulties with these patients or expected poor treatment outcome may be overcome as well as blind areas in healthprofessionals' perception concerning dependency among their patients and themselves.	0.4221976134777972
Though psychotherapy with addicts is sometimes exhausting, the readiness of psychotherapists to treat patients with substance disorders is increasing.	0.4613081660331639
Diagnosis nowadays is based on the distinction between drug depencency and drug abuse on the one hand and substance induced disorders on the other hand.	0.5266565781494287
Readiness for change and motivation for treatment are basic objects of psychotherapy in these patients.	0.5434410505206574
Therapeutic approaches to deal with this promising aspect of psychotherapy are presented.	0.4426870030628089
They are based on an empathic and clear therapeutic attitude.	0.5069350741787435
They can be easily implemented in different settings.	0.5148462568014669
At the end of the first part of this review in- patient and outpatient settings for the treatment of substance disorders are outlined.	0.738356561802762
This will be followed in the second part by an outline of different specific psychotherapeutic approaches.	0.5850509859862265
The following experimental study was conducted to develop biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in fractures of the distal radius and to evaluate their stability.	0.7088824620011823
A model of dorsal wedge osteotomy in the distal radial metaphysis was used to develop the surgical technique and to test the stability of the alternative methods of osteosynthesis.	0.7291652693287798
The concept for this model was based on commercially available materials which were either biodegradable or osteoconductive.	0.42976431199822607
Four different forms of biocompatible osteosynthesis were compared to combined Kirschner wire osteosynthesis (KWO), our preferred method of treatment of unstable Colles fracture.	0.6179490987073663
Biocompatible osteosynthesis was achieved with an invasivity and stability comparable to that of KWO.	0.5496529035330905
In conclusion, injection osteosynthesis exceeded the other biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in all respects.	0.43886812129025754
Regarding the recent developments in injectable materials for osteosynthesis it offers the best perspective for clinical application.	0.41532415796132965
The "pain in the lower limbs" (growing pain) represent one of the most frequent complaint pictures in the child orthopaedic consulting hour.	0.7746090045807066
The delimitation compared to other diseases is difficult and laborious on account of many differential diagnoses.	0.47618862492238856
Destination of our investigations was it to set up a standardized investigation diagram with recording all differential diagnoses.	0.32618225323791245
In psychotherapy with patients who do not tolerate the conditions of the 'talking cure' because they tend to act instead of verbalizing their experiences interactive entanglements are rather common.	0.4399803076379352
Often this is a consequence of nonverbal gestural behavior that directs interaction in the therapeutic dialogue while the exchange of words has taken a back seat.	0.48519706846452143
The symbolic space of verbal understanding gets lost then.	0.2071013413725331
Gestural behavior does not form an independent communication system as usage of 'body language' suggests.	0.31758626662226264
Instead as permanent concomitant of utterances it has primarily the function of regulating the interaction of patient and psychotherapist.	0.4231460545647024
The surgical treatment of varicous veins demands complete exclusion of the primary recirculation circuit.	0.5474894951468687
The diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical and ultrasound symptoms, on i.e.	0.8642311523083844
If there is saphenous vein agreement between them, phlebography will yield no additional information concerning the strategy for operation.	0.4729443149435726
The prospective comparative examination of non-invasive diagnostic methods versus phlebography shows different results in 12% of cases for the great saphenous vein and in 3% for the small with a correction of the operative procedure.	0.8319322861589697
In 10 cases of incomplete trunk varicosis, only one diagnosis was correct with non-invasive measures.	0.7628993511516258
This leads to the conclusion that phlebography should be done at the time of the preoperative examination if there are differences between the clinical and ultrasound symptoms.	0.8812986940942712
Undislocated odontoid fractures may lead on the basis of conventional x-rays only to a wrong conclusion with regard to biomechanical aspect of stability.	0.48701557577898746
In this aspect the classification based on Anderson and D'Alonzo takes a high risk to missunderstood the fracture stability and can results in a secondary fracture dislocation.	0.5617400266017628
Therefore it is important to make the decision about operative versus nonoperative treatment on the base of the trauma mechanism.	0.6839008830226466
In this case report we elucidate this problem and the higher risk of anterior approach for correction.	0.6644890333913842
Furthermore a better classification of densfractures will be recommended.	0.3115601856525842
In a period of 4 years between March 1994 and March 1998, 143 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery.	0.5610019853424344
According to manometric studies 76 patients had a short-floppy Nissen fundoplication, patients with impaired motility or paraesophageal hernias received a hemifundoplication (Toupet = 42, Dor/Thal = 25).	0.49328527075183703
Recurrent reflux symptoms appeared in 6,3 % after mean 16,7 months follow-up (Nissen = 2.6 %, Toupet = 2.3 %, Dor/Thal = 24 %, P < 0.01).	0.5916150987894329
Persistent dysphagia with reoperation occurred in 2.1 % (Nissen = 2.6 %, Toupet = 2.3 %, Dor/Thal = 0 %, n. s.).	0.6220199432205421
The assessment of Visick's score at the latest control showed the following: Visick I = 63.6 %, Visick II = 30.1 %, Visick III = 6.3 %, Visick IV = 0 %.	0.5686301127804932
The outcome of the operation was rated "excellent" or "good" by 91.6 % of the patients.	0.7076159189458867
In contrast to auditory brainstem potentials (ABR), a more apically defined generation of middle latency evoked potentials (MLR) can be assumed due to the longer integration time present.	0.6139492017948903
To date, the effect of stimulus frequency spectra on MLR has not been completely known.	0.5152854698463419
By using masking with high-pass filtered white noise in 12 normal-hearing adults, we measured the dependence of amplitude and latency of ABR and MLR on filter frequency.	0.5458119729522749
No differences were found between the masking effects for ABR and MLR evoked by tone bursts of 0.5 and 2 kHz.	0.6814555081652002
The high-pass masking of click stimuli showed a greater influence on the amplitude and latency of the ABR than on MLR.	0.6038531850272569
These different qualities have to be considered clinically when evaluating the methods and results of hearing testing with acoustic evoked potentials.	0.6445749585824709
Our findings show that MLR evoked by tone bursts should be used for the frequency selective diagnosis of hearing thresholds, especially in low- frequency ranges.	0.6903369707366573
Objectives: To clarify the incidence of sudden arrythmic death and associated risk factors in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation (HTx).	0.6569806286935593
Background: Some reports indicate a significant rate of sudden death in heart transplant recipients limiting long-term success of the operation.	0.7137155475014626
Incidence, underlying risk factors, etiologies, and methods for prediction or prevention of sudden death are poorly defined.	0.5658556090435187
Methods: Retrospective analysis of our cohort of 120 cardiac allograft recipients surviving the perioperative phase out of a total of 142HTx patients of the years 1984-1999.	0.5593937135129866
Clinical events (death, mode of death, Re-HTx, resuscitation) were noted and analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and related to the patients' characteristics by multivariate analysis.	0.7142239074509767
Sudden death in or out of hospital was defined as death within one hour of symptoms or unwittnessed death.	0.560782578804516
Clinical and postmortem findings (autopsies are available in 12/18 sudden death patients) were correlated to the mode of death.	0.6598328549145346
Results: During a mean follow-up interval of 4.6 +/- 3.5 years, 45 patients died (38%).	0.8806589181044091
The mode of death was non-sudden in 27 inpatients.	0.5513616593673394
18 deaths were sudden, 14 of these out of hospital.	0.48892637412700257
In addition there were three cardiac arrests with successful resuscitations, one of those patients died three month later suddenly, giving a number of a total of 21 cardiac arrests in 20HTx patients.	0.6154362232331788
The actuarial risk of cardiac arrest was 20% after 6 and 40% after 12 years.	0.9062455259001749
Based on postmortem analysis the etiologies of the events were attributed to transplant vasculopathy in 15 patients, rejection in 5 patients (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade >3A), and to unknown reasons in one.	0.6097078767723744
All three patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest had documented bradycardic events (2xtotal AV block, 1xsinus arrest).	0.3629333348587968
Pacemakers were implanted in these patients.	0.39311405678184
One of those died suddenly 2 months later.	0.4545930094356603
Significantly more HTx patients dying suddenly are smokers, had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and worse hemodynamics.	0.5867001555941386
QRS width and PR interval were significantly broadened in patients with transplant vasculopathy and cardiac arrest.	0.38463418909762553
In three cases, a decrease in heart rate variability, the occurence of sustained VT, and ST segment depressions prior to the cardiac arrest could be demonstrated.	0.7347492201070436
Conclusions: Sudden death occurs at a substantial rate after HTx.	0.4148625109846369
As HTx patient numbers are rising constantly, sudden cardiac death in this population will represent a significant problem.	0.5688198980204044
In our patients about 75% of the arrests can be attributed to graft-vasculopathy and one quarter to acute rejection.	0.5946469197283941
Diagnostic strategies have to be developed to detect patients at risk.	0.6412523372081319
Interestingly, some events may be caused from bradyarrhythmic rhythm disturbances.	0.553564005949413
Introduction: Traumatic dislocation is the most severe ligamentous injury of the knee.	0.7512602936669812
The indications for operative and conservative treatment are still controversial.	0.6078049766283193
Methods and results: From 1974 to 1994, 38 patients with documented knee dislocation were treated operatively in our department.	0.6412984710373189
Thirty-four of these patients were followed up for 3-16 years (mean: 8.6 years).	0.9539290457190652
In 29 cases of the follow-up group, reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments was performed.	0.5315439483866702
In the remaining cases the cruciate ligaments were left alone.	0.5875694662440674
At the time of follow-up, 90 % of the patients showed good knee stability, but 90 % had lack of motion as well.	0.8420933678353782
Post-traumatic osteoarthritis was mostly mild to moderate.	0.4136643785708717
Thirty-five percents of the patients achieved excellent to good results in the Lysholm Score.	0.7022522213668008
Conclusions: Positive prognostic factors were an age less than 40 years at the time of the accident, a low-energy trauma, e. g., a sports-related injury, early reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments, and initial postoperative functional treatment.	0.6958547521749545
Huntington's disease (HD) is member of a growing family of neurodegenerative diseases which are caused by a CAG-Triplet expansion in the coding region of their respective genes.	0.5345904880943477
The results of the research of the last years is very suggestive of a common pathomechanisms of all these diseases even though their clinical appearance may be quite different.	0.6930499020738197
The development of new animal models by transferring the human gene defect into the mouse genome has led to the finding of so-called intranuclear inclusion bodies.	0.4973643342680579
This new observation allowed to come closer to solving the problem how this genetic defect causes neurodegeneration.	0.33931589572644294
Recent studies on transgenic HD mice could also demonstrate a possible connection between the genetic defect and glutamate exitotoxicity in the neurodegenerative process of HD which had been emphasized by earlier animal models of the disease.	0.503844134284088
Transgenic animal models of HD will have an important impact on the understanding of the disease mechanisms and may contribute to a faster development and testing of new therapeutic approaches.	0.7597814340152309
Background: The Whipple operation (PD) is the standard operation in patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas and the periampullary region.	0.9068989971800449
However, the pylorus-preserving duodenopancreatectomy (PPPD) is supposed to be superior in gastrointestinal function.	0.7325978526009878
Methods: In a prospective randomized trial (October 1994-October 1998) PD and PPPD were compared in terms of global and gastrointestinal quality of life, operation time, duration of hospital stay, transfusions and perioperative morbidity.	0.6837082891021383
Quality of life was analyzed under standardized conditions (EORTC-QLQ-30) pre- and postoperatively (weeks 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60).	0.7580775574794205
Results: A duodenopancreatectomy was performed in 48 patients because of cancer of the head of the pancreas (n = 38) and the periampullary region (n = 10) (PD, n = 24; PPPD, n = 24).	0.7876906610119068
The PD and PPPD groups did not differ according to age, gender or UICC stage.	0.5353977578911532
Operation time was shorter in the PPPD group (206  +/-  48 vs 306  +/-  54 min) (P < 0.05).	0.5905601374569808
Morbidity did not differ between the two groups (PPPD 20 % vs PD 30 %, P > 0.05).	0.811781844360459
While there was no difference in global quality of life, gastrointestinal quality of life was postoperatively increased in the PPPD group regarding appetite, nausea and diarrhea (P < 0.05).	0.5596702183107164
While the preoperative body weight was reached after 6 months in 85 % of the PPPD group (n = 20), this was true in only 60 % of the PD-group (n = 14) (P < 0.05).	0.6616676108345815
Conclusion: PPPD seems to be associated with a better postoperative gastrointestinal quality of life than PD.	0.5622807151098744
Oxygen uptake (V.O2) and carbon dioxide elimination (V.CO2) can be measured with an indirect calorimeter; this method is well established in routine monitoring of ICU patients to evaluate metabolic state as a reflection of stress.	0.7321910533368172
In various experimental studies it was demonstrated that anaesthetics can influence whole-body metabolism.	0.42372000461725606
The purpose of this study was to examine whether indirect calorimetry can be used intraoperatively during routine anaesthesia and whether presumable changes in metabolism can be detected immediately.	0.6373449779234311
Abdominal aortic cross-clamping changes circulation, nutritional supply of the lower extremities and thus V.O2 and V.CO2.	0.640076129790724
We therefore used this operation for our study.	0.33953798149507336

The desmoplastic type of the squamous cell carcinoma (DSCC) of the skin is an entity which is readily distinguished by light microscopy.	0.730982958887369
The DSCC has fine branches surrounded by a desmoplastic stroma and shows in some cases typical perineural, perivascular and widespread intradermal invasion (maximum 6 cm!).	0.46075816386112595
This type accounts for 8.2% (n=44) of our collective of 594 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the skin and vermilion border.	0.7678285004973372
Clinically DSCC look like other malignant epithelial tumors of the skin.	0.5069336530537996
All tumors were followed up for at least 3 years (maximum 10 years).	0.689598006173791
The local recurrence rate was high (24.3%) even though micrographic surgery was carried out.	0.7683050279861579
The rate of local or regional metastasis was also very high (22.7%).	0.6604697040121532
In comparison the recurrence rate and the rate of metatasis of the remaining common 91.8% SCC's (n=550) was low: 2.6% and 3.8%, respectively.	0.7566303490263664
The DSCC seems to be identical with the so called neurotropic SCC, the fine stranded SCC or the SCC with perineural invasion which have a high rate of local recurrence and metastasis as well, but DSCC is a better generic histopathologic term for the entire group.	0.5918026573458638
The DSCC is best treated with micrographic surgery and wider safety margins than any other type and should be followed up very frequently.	0.524156619357883
In the final stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) the majority of patients develop chronic respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness.	0.5960635720010458
The interaction between the patient with ALS and the physician should be characterized by continuous communication, especially with respect to the prospect of ventilatory failure and for support.	0.7694103757726971
The patient and his family must be informed thoroughly about the natural history and the prognosis of ALS, depending on the individual disease process.	0.7361757155442177
Already in the early stage of the disease coping strategies should be discussed so that imminent respiratory emergencies can be handled.	0.7368168583416154

The immune response of the host is obviously stimulated by this treatment.	0.497662120733544
ECP is normally performed for 4 h per day on 2 consecutive days every 4 weeks.	0.4566381479116277
The treatment is well tolerated and causes few side effects.	0.6184003328446521
In our department, 1210 ECP treatments were administered to 41 patients between 1990 and 1994 and a preliminary evaluation was performed.	0.5683994564765679
These patients included 21 with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), 10 with progressive systemic scleroderma, 4 with chronic graft-versus-host disease and 1 each with pemphigus vulgaris, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, lupus erythematosus and cutaneous mucinosis.	0.5371074233963561
Patients with erythroderma and preserved immunocompetence achieved the best responses of all patients with CTCL.	0.5756128218006743
A treatment combining ECP with rlFN-, PUVA and/or radiation was also successful in patients with tumour-stage CTCL and lymph node involvement.	0.5207395683710971
Progressive systemic scleroderma responded in more than 50% of our cases.	0.7238201415108436
Treatment results were impressive in 4 patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease presenting with sclerodermatous and lichenoid changes of the skin and mucous membranes.	0.651233607090352
A clear improvement was also observed in the patient with pemphigus vulgaris refractory to standard therapies and in another patient with scleromyxoedema (Arndt-Gottron syndrome).	0.689730867146749
The effectiveness of ECP seems to be quite well established in CTCL, but remains to be examined in autoimmune dermatoses.	0.6436199218744271
ECP is an attractive addition to the dermatological therapies available but our experience is still preliminary.	0.46851383378017925

The indication for immunosuppressive treatment in MG should be regularly reconfirmed, particularly since at least 50% of patients can discontinue AZA after two to four years without risk of exacerbation.	0.6607348909664537
Failure to find the gallbladder at the usual or most common atypical sites during surgery for cholecystolithiasis is a rare but known problem.	0.5893580667537405
Although ultrasonography has 95 % sensitivity for the diagnosis of cholelithiasis, occasionally a small contracted gallbladder with stones and chronic cholecystitis will be difficult to visualize and can lead to erroneous interpretation.	0.48423923452883044
We report on the case of a patient presenting with abdominal colic and ultrasonographically confirmed cholecystolithiasis.	0.6756981023496943
During laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the gallbladder could not be detected.	0.5517324632970931
After laparoscopic staging followed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and abdominal computed tomography, agenesis of the gallbladder was confirmed.	0.38962019762209604

Malignant melanoma is the most important differential diagnosis in both clinical and histologic examination of melanocytic nevi.	0.7768251548243927
UV exposure with an erythemagenic dose and mechanical irritation of melanocytic nevi are able to induce reversible morphologic changes which simulate malignant melanoma.	0.3919348636572075
These changes are associated with an increased expression of HMB-45 antigen.	0.6595133851801595
In addition, an increased proliferation and repair activity is observed after UV exposure.	0.5639658480618496
The increased number of melanocytes located in suprabasal layers of the epidermis is accompanied by a change in keratinocyte adhesion molecule expression.	0.5133157427275717
The UV light is also able to influence the adhesive properties of melanocytes in vitro.	0.357734462317574
Therefore, both keratinocyte-derived factors and direct influence of UV on the melanocyte system are probably responsible for the morphologic changes.	0.5475179356814368

In 2 years, 2489 breast cancer cases were registered (status 6/98).	0.40167206200227207
Screening data were available for 1319 patients.	0.38530554684570656
The reduction in mortality, found in randomized studies, due to mammography in women over 50 years old was confirmed.	0.5777859938069828
A relative reduction of 44.8% in 10-year mortality could be estimated through mammography and 25.1% through palpation, in comparison with "doing nothing".	0.7542776090628809
We could also estimate the participation of screening and the used methods in the Munich region.	0.5311419433519069
If the mammographies carried out today were used at 2-year intervals for women aged between 50 and 70 years, then the mammography screening could be performed with no additional costs for 70% of the women.	0.7038799350677761
The known facts regarding the population-based mortality and regarding the acceptance of the palpation screening and frequency of mammography are additional aspects for inclusion in the discussion of what research projects in Germany are and what they should fulfill.	0.5162875018855936
Insufficiency after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a typical complication.	0.3871728372380825
Between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1997 a total of 604 operations at the ACL were performed in the traumatology department of Nuremberg hospital.	0.5948863736992923
During the same period 48 "transplant failures" were treated.	0.7060284494262606
There were various reasons for the failure of the transplant, some of them technical, occurring during the operation or during aftercare.	0.7123620776335516
Another reason for a re-rupture of the transplant was by trauma.The different reasons for the failure of the transplant were analysed in our patient population.	0.674527933389086
The 48 patients were classified into five groups depending on the primary operation and the means of treatment (I = ACL sutures, II = artificial ligament, III = semitendinosus tendon, IV and V = ipsi- or contralateral bone-patellar-bone graft harvest after ACL reconstruction), so that the different ways of treatment were better comparable.	0.6906053767337474
Of the 48 patients 36 were followed up over an average of 2 1/2 years using the Lysholm scores and the OAK scores.	0.6633208478426302
The total score of the 36 patients was 81 points and can be valued as good using the evaluation scale of Lysholm and Gillquist.	0.5020490541690692
Using the OAK score we found an average of 71 to 81 points in the different groups; results in the group with the ipsilateral bone-tendon-bone graft harvest after ACL reconstruction were the worst.	0.6919676071165869
The totalscore using the OAK score was 74 points and was considered "moderate".	0.3731575263755963
The score results were discussed and compared with the current literature.	0.5682466246381196
In this case report, we focus on the importance of scurvy as a differential diagnosis in a newborn presenting with swollen legs.	0.6787911319983512
Scurvy is rare in highly developed countries and often overlooked.	0.421978831501662
Medical history, clinical symptoms and radiological findings are crucial for diagnosis.	0.7364181067633968
The diagnosis is confirmed by successful treatment with ascorbic acid.	0.5219472405668828
Hemangiomas of the skull base are rare neoplasms and are easily misdiagnosed as acoustic neuromas when occurring in the internal auditory canal.	0.5773928704495267
Among these tumors, ossifying hemangiomas are characterized histologically be newly formed bone tissue within their substance.	0.32892585363175203
We describe a 26-year old female patient who presented with left-sided sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus.	0.7532385164658671
T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a bright space-occupying lesion of the internal auditory canal with extension to the geniculate ganglion.	0.5306550485452367
Bony erosions of the internal auditory canal were proved by high-resolution computed tomography.	0.5862912475994749
A hemangioma was suspected preoperatively and was resected via a middle cranial fossa approach.	0.40961775371909237
Histologically, new bone formations were found in a cavernous hemangioma.	0.788050295375174
In general, radiologic findings can suggest a hemangioma of the internal auditory canal and help to differentiate it from acoustic neuroma.	0.477542559981666
Based on the histological findings of intratumoral bone formation, the hemangioma in our patient was classified as an ossifying hemangioma.	0.7224438834401394
However, reactive bone formation at the borders of a tumor in the internal auditory canal can also be mistaken as new intratumoral bone formation.	0.6194521725946115
Myocardial ischemia results in myocardial dysfunction.	0.31134621524404305
Recovery may be delayed ("stunning"), or persistent if perfusion remains reduced ("hibernation") and ischemia may go on to necrosis, thus, contributing to chronic heart failure.	0.63067998690338
In addition, myocardium not directly affected by ischemia may undergo adaptive processes like hypertrophy and dilatation, which may result in chronic left heart failure.	0.5916982570683877
This process is characterized by hemodynamic, neurohumoral, and progressive morphologic changes of the heart which are closely interrelated.	0.6459055164210856
Hemodynamic changes basically consist of an increase in left ventricular filling pressure and a decrease in global ejection fraction, and, in most cases years after myocardial infarction, in an increase in systemic vascular resistance and right atrial pressure.	0.7257768709179577
Neurohumoral changes consist of an increase in plasma catecholamines, atrial natriuretic factor and vasopressin, and in an activation of the renin-angiotensin-system.	0.6828134146103991
Plasma endothelin-1 was recently reported to be increased in patients with heart failure, and prognosis was related to endothelin levels.	0.6148399305036218
Diminished response of vessels to endothelium (EDRF/NO) dependent vasodilatation suggests impairment of vascular endothelium in heart failure.	0.4170036705915237
Local changes of cardiac neurohumoral systems could contribute to structural changes of the heart, e.g., systemic activation to hemodynamic changes.	0.5921437369382404
Structural changes of the heart are characterized by an increase in volume and thickness of surviving myocardium and an expansion of ischemic and necrotic myocardium.	0.6324494663016413
Molecular control of these processes which include various cell types, such as cardiomyocytes and cardiofibroblasts, are currently an issue of intense research and could result in specific therapeutic importance.	0.5005191731459723
Postoperative infection in the locomotor system may lead to malpractice suits.	0.4191917594501881
The aim of the study was to determine the success rate of these claims and the type of expert-confirmed medical negligence so that strategies for avoiding such negligence can be offered.	0.5895490808732213
A total of 261 decrees concerning suspected malpractice after postoperative infection in the locomotor system were retrospectively evaluated.	0.399133028294581
Of these, 43.7 % claims were successful.	0.5552707911721916
The most frequent type of negligence was late diagnosis (34.2 %), followed by inconsistant treatment (27.2 %) and insufficient surgical revision (5.3 %).	0.7305146251646627
In 33.3 %, combined types of negligence were found.	0.5629752560103429
Most frequently, negligence was suspected after infection following hand surgery and internal fixation of long bones.	0.5434379335940323
The highest success rate of claims was seen after puncture of joints (69.2 %).	0.5798904953513587
Insufficient documentation was confirmed in 15.3 %.	0.4620525486281149
The majority of negligence resulted from diagnostic and therapeutic doubts, which could be avoided, e. g., by a clear definition of infection, consultation of a second opinion, a 2nd-look operation, undelayed and radical surgical revision, painstaking follow-up and disciplined documentation.	0.6878701214185682
Abstract   Patient satisfaction plays an increasing part in the analysis of the outcome of medical treatment.	0.7949830401966004
The aim of the study was to compare health-related quality of life in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular or conventional surgery.	0.7561056559738011
A total of 40 patients were included (20 treated by endovascular and 20 by conventional surgery).	0.7257174398342142
A questionnaire with 28 items similar to the SF-36 was answered during scheduled appointments.	0.4783172632665348
On the third postoperative day, the conventionally treated patients were more frequently confined to bed (80% vs. 32%) and complained of intervention-related pain (90% vs. 42%) and incisional pain (26% vs. 15%); 55% of the patients suffered from obstipation (vs. 5% of the endovascular group).	0.7331601161843093
Furthermore, the preoperative psychological stress seemed to be intensified.	0.6269565021921555
In comparable percentage, both the endovascular and conventionally treated patients were limited in social activities perioperatively.	0.5307014970084822
Sexual dysfunction was more frequent in the conventional group (33% vs. 13% three months postoperative).	0.6494846908651218
In addition, the conventionally treated patients were more limited in their physical activities (25% vs. 40%) and had more fear of ambulation (35% vs. 6%).	0.6441224034133995
The patients treated by an endovascular approach complained about frequent examinations (39% vs. 5%) that were often related to X-ray exposure (67% vs. 20%).	0.6838377836348005
All of the conventionally operated patients had a sense of improvement (vs. 89% of the endovascular group); nevertheless only 28% felt completely healthy, compared to 11% of the endovascular treated patients.	0.68264990142817
Advantages of the endovascular treated patients were "short hospital stay", "decreased pain", "smaller scars", and a "shorter confinement to bed".	0.781025468289527
After intervention the conventionally treated patients were more limited in almost all quality-of-life aspects.	0.5255519260461669
After 3 months, differences between the groups decreased except for sexual dysfunction and limited physical activities.	0.5919625786540855
The patients treated by endovascular surgery complained more about frequent X-ray examinations than the conventionally treated group.	0.5539904943543927
In the majority of ventilated patients endotracheal intubation is required only for a short time period.	0.5155097583634964
However, about 20% of the patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation.	0.7424869053699706
Apart from dysfunction of the central nervous system with a reduced respiratory drive, the vast majority of patients being difficult to wean suffer from either an increased load or a decreased capacity of their respiratory muscles.	0.5673388133884971
Furthermore, beside compromised respiratory mechanics other causes of difficult weaning are, e.g., left heart failure, inadequate sedation, neuropsychiatric issues, malnutrition and aspiration.	0.4903440591241879
The mere application of a consistent weaning strategy (independent from its concrete content) leads to an improved success rate.	0.47505719974454896
In this article three essential aspects of a weaning strategy are dealt with: 1) The concept of interventions (in particular focusing on mechanical ventilation modes unloading respiratory muscles), 2) pathophysiologically based parameters to predict weaning success or failure and 3) organisation of the T-tube trials.	0.5982037121868651
A new approach in weaning of long-term ventilated patients is non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NMV).	0.5981510190467465
Compared to invasive mechanical ventilation NMV aims at reducing weaning time, decreasing complication rate and improving prognosis.	0.43810572627898986
Finally, the last section addresses terminal weaning.	0.5045617277637378
The psychoanalytic cure is characterized by a basic antinomy of time and time-lessness.	0.5548615423974952
Freud based the daily psychoanalytic work on the order of the mechanic clock (the time of the machine) to regulate a relationship which is unique in our culture.	0.6661221140009612
The temporal order of the cure responds to the logic of the temporal path.	0.4755136791399883
On the opposite, in the world of the unconscious the familiar concepts of cause and effect as well as of before and after are abolished.	0.7230612347510733
"Symmetrical madness" prevails (Matte Blanco).	0.23015724966517773
The temporal core of the analytic situation is bi-logical.	0.4360288249929514
This ambiguity is reflected in the technical principles.	0.3871587359500935
Free association breaks through the logic of the temporal path, again and again.	0.48373678612654547
There are, however, different defence strategies defusing its unforeseeability.	0.42232539250963724
The tension between the time that determines the analytic setting and the timelessness of free association gets once again a process of temporal order going.	0.4161889772009864
Present social changes and in connection with them the changed time strategies endanger the temporal order of the analytic cure.	0.441368292409117
Several historical reports focusing on the heredity of migraine, as well as recent studies on its epidemiology and molecular biology, have revealed evidence for a decisive role of genetic factors in the aetiopathogenesis of familial migraine.	0.6535238411157533
Indeed, family studies, segregation analyses and twin studies have shown that genetic factors play an important role in disposition towards migraine but could not explain the entire aetiopathogenesis.	0.5184101522258856
The influence of extragenetic factors, however, remains mostly unknown.	0.43594041473885825
Recent linkage analyses have provided evidence for genetic heterogeneity.	0.37510273805602445
A locus for Familial Hemiplegic Migraine (FHM), the only known type of migraine that follows autosomal-dominant transmission, has been linked to chromosome 19p13 but genetic heterogeneity has also been shown, i. e. different types of migraine could be excluded from this locus.	0.5937578740171231
Further investigations should concentrate on identifying the FHM gene on chromosome 19p13, on linkage analyses with markers for different susceptibility genes, and on genomic analyses of highly informative pedigrees.	0.5667685028059176
This would lead to further clues to the pathogenesis underlying migraine and, thus, to therapeutic developments.	0.6754803716001954
Radiographic findings suggestive of osteopenia and osteoporosis are frequently encountered in daily medical practice and can result from a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from highly prevalent causes such as postmenopausal and involutional osteoporosis to very rare endocrinologic and hereditary or acquired disorders.	0.42391647521397713
As bone mass is lost, changes in the trabecular and cortical bone structure occur.	0.520906530537303
The changes that are visible on conventional radiographs may give specific information on the etiology of the underlying disease.	0.6765604021917894
Even though conventional radiography is indispensable in the differential diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis, visual assessment of bone mass and its changes is subjective and strongly depends on the radiographic technique.	0.5939880659742736
With radiogrammetry and radiographic absorptiometry two methods exist that rely on conventional radiography and allow for a quantification of bone mass.	0.4286973325269066
This article describes the author's experience during the 1-year AGA Pittsburgh fellowship from 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1997.	0.5790977640439167
The article is focused on the work in the Musculoskeletal Research Center and the Center for Sports Medicine of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery in Pittsburgh.	0.5573328208323511
The author describes projects on the biomechanics of the cruciate ligaments, using robotic technology.	0.5277675177563501
Organizational and social aspects of the life in Pittsburgh are discussed.	0.5151550129111679
The different subgroups of hypercalciuria cannot be separated clearly by the Pak calcium-load test.	0.30351827527902003
To improve the diagnosis and therapy we examined all relevant parameters of calcium metabolism in 32 patients with calcium urolithiasis and hypercalciuria (> 6.25 mmol/day).	0.7785390324426591
We also conducted bone mineral density measurements as well as the Pak calcium-load test.	0.40160910794061483
In most cases the pathophysiological constellations which Pak takes as the basis for his classification of hypercalciuria could not be shown.	0.6740456102581712
To date, diagnostics only insufficiently explains the genesis of hypercalciuria (except pHPT).	0.3735956218057421
As a consequence, a therapeutic problem arises: a low-calcium diet should not be generally recommended, since some patients may develop osteopenia.	0.7325920360724271
From our investigation the following diagnostic and therapeutic conclusions can be drawn: (1) Hypercalciuria in primary hyperparathyroidism should be treated by surgical removal of the adenoma.	0.724424036833204
(2) The parathormone-independent osteogenic form should be treated with thiazides.	0.6534040426054905
(3) Hypercalciuria with increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D should be treated by low-calcium diet.	0.5658413302297061
A 58-year old man with wilson's disease sustained a bilateral spontaneous rupture of the quadriceps tendon.	0.6112697442762687
The histological investigation showed advanced degeneration of tendon structure and cupper deposits.	0.3422106320952244
After tenosuture the patient had complete cure with full range of movement.	0.5059292156734584
We discuss about relation of wilson x s disease, cupper deposits and degenerative changes of tendon tissue.	0.4028345631651403
Within the framework of the National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 the Short Form Questionnaire SF-36 has been applied to measure the health related quality of life (HRQOL).	0.5095111665326857
This opened more opportunities than simply creating a new normative sample for the German adult population.	0.3863423714945918
Thus, the very complex interdependence between morbidity, satisfaction, risk factors, health related behaviours, social status, age and sex on the one side and the subjective assessment of health related quality of life on the other hand may be investigated.	0.7082951310313957
First results of the Survey data are presented which open the discussion of the possibilities and limits of the SF-36 instrument for measuring health related quality of life at the population level.	0.6378473308962415
The von Willebrand's Disease affects about 1-3 % of the population and it is undiagnosed in most people.	0.6917386735604456
Originally described by the Finish physician Erik von Willebrand in 1926 this disorder is associated with mucous membran bleeding including epistaxis, hypermenorhoea and excessive bleeding from surgery and dental procedures.	0.3712255690921762
In von Willebrands disease the patients have a quantitative or qualitative abnormality in the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) which has two major functions: it serves by bridging between platelets and injury site in the blood vessel wall, and it circulates as a complex with factor VIII, protecting it from rapid degradation.	0.6396068808755815
More than 20 different types and subtypes of vWD have been described but almost all patients can be classified as having 1 of the 2 most common types of vWD.	0.7024447548063998
About 70 % of patients have type 1 and about 10-20 % present themself with type 2A and 2B vWD type 3 in about 10 %.	0.647772609452703
By taking a clinical history of bleeding it is important to think about vWD and to make the appropriate diagnosis.	0.626645844759705
If the vWD is suspected diagnostic tests should include an activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, factor VIII:C, Ristocetin cofactor, and vWF antigen.	0.44438393334120596
Additional testing of ristocetin induced plattlet adhesion (RIPA), the multimeric structure and collagen binding test and gen-analysis allow diagnosing the different types of v. Willebrand Disease.	0.44937957087977753
The treatment of choice in mild forms is the synthetic agent desmopressin.	0.6287515341161343
In patients with severe type 1, type 2B, 2N and type 3 or in people who do not response to desmopressin, the appropriate treatment is a factor VIII concentrate that is rich of vWF.	0.6471856056919767
Until now no recommendations in the orthopaedic literature have been found regarding diagnosis and treatment of vWS patients.	0.5736974476168994
Based on the experience with 43 orthopaedic patients presenting vWD over the last 15 years a contemporary guideline for the successful perioperative management of vWD in orthopaedic surgery is presented.	0.5500502005355572
In a close collaboration between the orthopaedic surgeon and the specialized haemostaseologist every invasive procedure in patients with vWD can be undertaken without the risk of excessive bleeding.	0.4933816181131454
Patients with a prior myocardial infarction (MI) have a high risk of perioperative reinfarction compared with the normal population (5%-8% vs. 0.1%-0.7%) [10].	0.9479392835601188
According to Rao [13], a reduction of this risk is possible when patients are monitored invasively and all haemodynamic parameters are kept within the physiological range.	0.580854126082821
In most institutions it is not feasible to treat patients as Rao recommended: this would overstrain both hospital structure and financial resources.	0.6192516504347116
We studied the incidence of perioperative MI and other cardiac events in patients with prior MI.	0.5669744774056464
During the study period the anaesthesia and intensive care methods of our institution were neither changed nor influenced.	0.48054718090429316
In addition to this clinical evaluation, we performed perioperative Holter electrocardiographic monitoring and measured serum levels of the recently introduced marker troponin T (parts II and III).	0.6514487069814692
Small basal cell carcinomas of the trunk are usually regarded as relatively harmless.	0.5525493062311675
In contrast, large and ulcerating basal cell carcinomas may become a therapeutic challenge with a less favourable prognosis and high risk of recurrence.	0.6488091885745644
The development of mutilating giant basal cell carcinomas appears less due to the biological aggressive character of the tumors, but rather to the patients' attitude of neglect.	0.7291142006171218
The case of a 62-year-old patient, featuring such attitude, demonstrates how a common basal cell carcinoma of the trunk can grow over a period of years to a troublesome ulcerating tumor.	0.5490778294883201
This epidemiologic, retrospective follow-up mortality study is based on the data gathered in the department of forensic medicine at the University Hospital of Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt/Main.	0.577409541148958
Over a period of 21 years (1972-1992), roughly 21,000 forensic autopsies revealed 39 cases (0.19%) of natural deaths occuring during sexual activity.	0.5410793727572706
Except for two women, all of these cases were men of an average age of 61.3 years.	0.8055707241918678
The most frequent cause of death was myocardial infarction (n=21/53.8%), three of these cases involving pericardial tamponade accompanied by myomalacia.	0.6808842071031306
The medical history of twelve of the deceased showed a previous myocardial infarction.	0.5745810697343066
Most of the deaths took place during or after sexual intercourse or manual stimulation.	0.4838986443644538
In most cases sudden death occured during the sexual act with a prostitute.	0.42015531799825184
The annual incidence of sudden cardiovascular deaths during sexual activity is estimated to be 0.2/100,000 men.	0.6133869760699561
The risk for women is lower by a factor of 12.	0.5516627900381735
Problem: An investigation into CT-controlled carve-suction biopsy for a histological clarification of indefinite intrathoracic masses.	0.4601088283449927
Current concepts in treating arthritis by gene transfer are described, including different vector systems and strategies of gene transfer into target cells.	0.4782641349635412
Promissing antiarthritic gene products are a variety of growth factors which facilitate increased matrix synthesis and mitogensis in articular chondrocytes.	0.4099776215338874
Furthermore, rheumatoid joint destruction can be treated genetically by the transfer of certain antiinflammatory cytokine genes, which provide locally high concentrations of the antiinflammatory gene product.	0.6338493437435816
First clinical trails using the IRAP gene (interleukin I receptor antagonist protein) to eliminate the inflammatory reaction caused by interleukin I in rheumatoid joints are on its way.	0.5245230689063246
In order to investigate potential improvement in cartilage regeneration retroviral TGF- gene transfer in rabbit articular chondrocytes has been carried out.	0.4428523185599558
The TGF- group showed an in vitro increase in collagen type II neosynthesis by 304 %, compared to normal chondrocytes.	0.5569491135517214
Spreading depression is a fascinating phenomenon that can be provoked by chemical, electrical or mechanical stimuli of the cortex.	0.4732535799260516
Spreading depression-like transient depolarizations are observed in the periinfarct tissue after focal ischemia.	0.4484583814003471
The reduction in electrical activity and a negative direct current potential shift propagating over the cortex with a rate of 2-5 mm/minute are the physiological hallmarks.	0.5994985311657985
It is thought that spreading depression and peri-infarct depolarizations might play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine and stroke.	0.43259742931667977
However, these events have never been detected in humans.	0.6334715327299366
This paper reviews the physiological characteristics of spreading depression and peri-infarct depolarizations and discusses their potential role in migraine and stroke.	0.37706546458630164
Because of the shifting age peak, measles, mumps and rubella will be more and more a danger for adults.	0.46178424007415314
The MMR combined vaccination reveals an effective method for prevention of these diseases and their consecutive symptoms.	0.5798046869453546
By means of the twice-done MMR vaccination measles, mumps and the congenital rubella syndrome could be eliminated.	0.418050276159882
With the increasing demands on hospitals for improved quality and lower costs, hospitals have been forced to reevaluate their manner of operation and quality assurance programms.	0.625605366761246
Hospitals have also been faced with customer dissatisfaction and intense competition.	0.32242099868834256
This article reviews current quality-management systems and examines their position in dermatology.	0.4657114380024563
The continuous follow-up of all cruciate ligament lesions showed the correctness of patient-adapted procedures.	0.5873399655670921
While the gold standard for repair is a replacement procedure, direct repair with autologous augmentation is an excellent option in adolescents.	0.5829177271877825
The results of 13 single-stage reconstructions of large and complex defects in the head and neck by using eight free radial forearm flaps as well as five pectoralis major myocutaneous flaps were analyzed.	0.5126223186354939
No complete flap loss occurred in any case.	0.27798406393614905
The results with radial forearm flap reconstructions proved to be better functionally and aesthetically.	0.5430520750573185
Due to the time needed for the microvascular anastomoses, the length of the operations was sometimes prolonged.	0.6745013009243277
Pectoralis major flaps were found to be more difficult to handle and were used in those cases in which the application of free radial forearm flaps was expected to produce higher risks.	0.6965744181820701
Psychotherapists have the alternative, to design quality assurance within certain boundaries by themselves, or otherwise leave this important task to external instances.	0.5175763651313249
Those will apply their own criteria in developing a concept.	0.3008649812273114
This paper discusses the question, how far quality assurance in the field of analytic psychotherapy has to accept the definitions and concepts from other fields such as industry or somatic medicine, without changing or deteriorating the quality that in the end should be improved.	0.5527702365051741
Differentiation is necessary between the use of the Psy-BaDo for individual quality assurance of the individual psychotherapist and for quality- and psychotherapy-research.	0.6279459130308396
This paper points out new approaches to modifying the present concept of quality assurance for the purposes of analytic psychotherapy.	0.49352960662573214
Cicatrical pemphigoid (CP) comprises a groupf of patients with a chronic subepidermal blistering disease which primarily involves mucous membranes; lesions characteristically heal with scarring.	0.47004239431111866
Immunofluorescence investigations typically demonstrate deposits of tissue bound and circulating immunoreactants of the IgG and less frequently of the IgA class in a linear pattern along the basement membrane zone.	0.3395359354107837
These autoantibodies are thought to play an important role in the blister formation of CP.	0.44580983586780615
Most patients show binding to the bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 (BPag2), collagen type XVII, with a molecularweight of 180 kD.	0.6427661998510285
A smaller group of patients with CP have autoantibodies to laminin 5.	0.5001905385496481
Animal models confirm that autoantibodies binding to these two adhesion molecules (BPag2 and laminin 5) are important in blister formation.	0.6112269551837236
There are other autoantigens described in CP; however, they are only found in small groups of CP patients and most of them are not further characterised.	0.6034972839021073
The described molecules are part of the hemidesmosomal adhesion complex.	0.36462395431870614
Impaired function of any component of this complex may lead to a separation of the epidermis from the dermis; better knowledge about the single molecules and the exact localisation of epitopes within these molecules may lead to further understanding of the clinical picture.	0.6723050318096844
Study objective: The clinical effect of ketoprofen is based not only on the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.	0.6577429316225099
Ketoprofen also acts through kynurenic acid as a central antagonist on the NMDA receptor.	0.31324950052600303
Due to this central analgesic mechanism of ketoprofen, we expected an analgesic preemptive effect.	0.551816518503693
This study was carried out following the Breivik/Stubhaug preemptive effect study design.	0.4560825918748072
Dystopies of the bony orbit are caused mainly by craniosynostosis, facial clefts and encephaloceles.	0.4537476447497833
This article presents the results of the surgical correction of orbital hypertelorism in 24 patients.	0.720383370506881
Using this operation technique, the bony interorbital distance was decreased from an average of 47.6 mm to 22.8 mm.	0.6969613210648732
However, the distance between the soft tissues was not reduced by the same amount as the distance between the bony orbits.	0.612776752637889
The intercanthal distance decreased from an average of 58.5 mm to 44.5 mm, whereby an additional refixation of the medial palpebral ligament resulted in a reduction of the intercanthal distance to 40.8 mm.	0.7609970216659235
A strabismus divergens was seen preoperatively in 18 patients, postoperatively only in 8 patients.	0.5290098730426576
Four of the latter had to undergo operative correction of the diplopia.	0.6077395934603655
We conclude that the operative technique is not reserved only for complex cases of hypertelorism because it shows satisfactory functional and aesthetic results with a low complication rate.	0.6430267201140026
Four years after extensive pneumonectomy on the left side with resection of the aortic wall and patch reconstruction for a T4 carcinoma, 2 years after adjuvant radiation and 10 months after drainage therapy of late intrathoracic empyema, destruction of the infected Dacron patch led to rupture of the aorta descendens.	0.6734929065717999
Successful primary emergency reconstruction of the aorta descendens was followed by venetian blind plasty (Heller) and transposition of the omentum majus for omentoplasty of the aortal wall and reduction of the pneumonectomy cavity.	0.5456894972054274
The rate of prosthetic infections is between 0.3 and 2.5% and must be taken into consideration even in cases of intrathoracic vascular reconstruction with alloplastic prostheses.	0.8141890891124207
After lung resection it is necessary to cover up the prosthetic graft by using autogenous material to obtain prosthetic incorporation into the protective tissue.	0.42682313065632116
In intrathoracic infectious complications, extra-anatomic bypass grafting or autogenous vascular graft implantation should be considered.	0.47612067051785345
If there is no possibility of carrying out these procedures, first aggressive local debridement of the infected vascular wall and afterwards coverage with alloplastic prosthetics with omentum transposition and thoracoplasty are essential to minimize postoperative infection and obtain solid anchorage in the surrounding tissue.	0.5105969627346593
The evaluation of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most intriguing and challenging aspects of the daily practice in dermatohistopathology.	0.6572468989118243
For the diagnosis of malignant melanoma and melanocytic nevi, standardized and reproducible criteria are required.	0.5908235809526674
In case of the diagnosis of melanoma, the histopathological report must include all important data relevant for the prognosis which may also influence the therapeutic procedure.	0.6897544662108056
The following paper summarizes the recommendations of the study group on malignant melanoma formed by the Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft.	0.6036627582552487
Recent studies have shown that acute infections, especially of the respiratory tract, are an important risk factor for cerebral ischemia.	0.8447305542400528
Additionally we know that chronic dental infections may be a risk for myocardial infarction and artherosclerosis.	0.6397372208696752
However, the connection between stroke and dental infections has hardly been examined so far.	0.5586068202185326
Therefore we performed a case-control study using a standardized questionaire and examination.	0.6087751342646459
We investigated 66 patients consecutive to a acute cerebral ischemia/stroke and 60 age- and sex-matched nonstroke neurological patients as a control group.	0.5326899315953356
Dental status was determined by a so called total dental index (TDI) which reflects primarily caries, periodontitis, periapical lesions, devital and missing teeth as well as by a panoramic index (PI).	0.530089009702191
Specifically, older patients with cerebrovascular ischemia tended to have a significantly worse dental status and had more severe periodontitis and periapical lesions than control subjects.	0.5480658985144095
A predefined poor dental status was associated with cerebrovascular ischemia independent from other vascular risk factors and social status.	0.5452799399150308
In conclusion, poor dental health, mainly resulting from chronic dental infections, may be associated with an increased risk for cerebrovascular ischemia.	0.6834060001851922
The results must now be verified in larger studies.	0.3438245891306519
As chronic dental infections are a common and also easily treatable factor, their identification as a risk factor for stroke would be quite important in the field of preventive medicine.	0.6535015449969361
Adjuvant basic therapy plays a central role  in the therapeutic approach to atopic eczema in childhood.	0.7392288164688936
It involves the regular use of emollients and oil baths according to the clinical picture.	0.5326915984790372
Emollients containing urea may cause problems when used in younger children due to their stinging effect.	0.43566295034787145
Glucocorticosteroids still form the mainstay  of anti-inflammatory therapy and are superior to other topical drugs with anti-inflammatory effects.	0.5904509291988932
Antihistamines preferably of the sedative type can be used successfully  during periods of exacerbation.	0.5366765865906862
Systemic use of antibiotics is essential in cases of impetiginized atopic eczema.	0.573647946155684
In cases of bacterial-triggered eczema, the topical use of antibiotics in cases of limited or of antiseptics in generalized disease may be helpful.	0.6427113085098153
The present paper presents data obtained over a 12 year period, on the matrix synthesis and turnover in some 650 arthritic and 180 non-arthritic (N) human cartilages using a standardised in vitro method.	0.676261500103771
When the relative metabolic (synthetic/repair activity) of these human cartilages was compared, it was demonstrated that in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cartilages synthetic activity was diminished by approximately 50% as compared with N cartilages.	0.6931385862589294
However, the turnover rate of matrix was not significantly different between Non-arthritic and OA, but was very substantially increased in RA cartilages compatible with the activity of inflammatory cells and proteolytic enzymes released from pannus.	0.6515839993894803
The action of 13 NSAIDs was compared in terms of their effect on cartilage GAG synthesis.	0.45100588904699157
3 of these NSAIDs were also studied in terms of their effect on cartilage collagen synthesis.	0.42000840987132865
Consideration of the results in this study and from published material, led to the suggestion that NSAIDs may be divided into 3 categories in respect of their in vitro action on the extracellular matrix of human arthritic cartilages:   1.	0.7256980144363517
Those such as Aceclofenac, Tenidap and Tolmetin which can stimulate matrix synthesis 2.	0.33313066813681735
Those such as Piroxicam, Tiaprofenic Acid and Aspirin which appear to be without significant effect on matrix synthesis and, 3.	0.5008430819635442
Those like Naproxen, Ibuprofen, Indomethacin, Nimezulide which significantly inhibit matrix synthesis.	0.2847928088745244
It is suggested that the stimulatory action of group 1 NSAID is due to inhibition of locally produced IL1 and consequent expression of growth factor activity.	0.44869985466640544
Other NSAIDs may also inhibit IL1 synthesis or release, but probably do not have a beneficial effect on chondrocyte synthetic activity as they have toxic effects on cartilage metabolism.	0.5275701593522758
These experiments led to the suggestion that NSAIDs such as Aceclofenac would be appropriate for long-term treatment of arthritic conditions provided that one is prepared to extrapolate between in vitro experiments on human cartilage and what may be happening in vivo.	0.45154110254684027
The article begins with a general introduction to the problems of pre-operative anxiety and its impact on the post-operative course development.	0.632524195567293
Then the treatment of a patient who developed an anxiety-syndrome before a necessary heart operation is described.	0.7834322789132807
The treatment lasted 6 hours and included psychotherapy by guided affective imagery.	0.3232271863350414
One and a half years later a follow-up interview was carried out by a colleague of the original therapist.	0.6074856374030777
The interview was based on the assumption that patients are able to give a competent statement about their previous treatment.	0.6100308134037364
The results are discussed under the aspect of therapeutic factors of psychotherapy.	0.5839148303949309
Physiologically, angiogenesis in adults is a controlled process which plays a role, for example, in wound healing.	0.6305860590059532
Pathological angiogenesis is observed in tumor formation and represents a multifactorial process, in which specific angiogenic factors, as well as growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules are involved.	0.6009687620256571
Tumor growth is characterized by an imbalance in favor of angiogenic over angiogenesis-inhibiting factors.	0.45017812438732724
Some of the most frequently examined angiogenic factors are vascular endothelial growth factor, acidic/basic fibroblast growth factors and the platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor.	0.6240195791986962
The most important angiogenesis inhibitors are angiostatin and thrombospondin.	0.4422916312578898
To date, the clinical relevance of tumor angiogenesis has been shown for several human tumors.	0.8256030965886532
For most urological tumors, the grade of tumor vessel formation, measured as microvessel density, has been associated with metastases, tumor growth and clinical course.	0.6569913524677068
The prognostic value of this feature of malignant growth seems to be higher than that of most of the classical and newer prognostic factors.	0.6269892068928755
Systematic investigations of tumor angiogenesis are becoming increasingly relevant for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and offer opportunities for the development of new specific therapeutic approaches in clinical oncology.	0.7056985657848531
Introduction: CPR is an essential part of resuscitation.	0.571699669712166
German medical students must take part in at least two low-level basic life support courses, one for a driver's license and one for admission to medical school.	0.5980130039585774
The knowledge and skill of German medical students in CPR performance were studied.	0.39031817863218354
Psychoanalysis is regarded to be mainly disorderoriented.	0.2597952861928181
Indeed, since its beginning, it was characterised by the two-sided orientation towards disorder and resources.	0.7664155720240488
Contemporary concepts of the psychoanalytic encounter, especially actualgenetic conceptions of the analysis of transference, lay the ground for better integrating both aspects.	0.5124190843441414
This development implies new approaches to the psychoanalytic process and technique, and especially to interpretation.	0.7468323643981409
More than before, contemporary psychoanalytic interpretation refers to progressive coping strategies within and outside transferential processes.	0.36736364952526623
During the last few decades, traumatic injuries of the hip joint have significantly increased in number, and traffic accidents have also increased.	0.8045230676384868
Depending on the speed, direction of the forces and the position of the femur at the moment of impact, different patterns of injury occur.	0.6523207127691577
Basically, they are classified as hip dislocations, dislocation fractures and acetabular fractures.	0.545870336153814
These injuries have in common a high rate of concomitant lesions.	0.4260746607750927
Several classification systems have been developed for these injuries.	0.6395600172689415
Commonly, Stewart and Milford's or Levin's classification is used for dislocations and dislocation fractures.	0.37956692264285313
For acetabular fractures, Judet and Letournel's classification and its newer version developed by Helfet (AO classification) are generally accepted.	0.46868439824071395
Fractures of the femoral head, though included in these classifications, are typically described by separate classifications like the one presented in 1957 by Pipkin.	0.6162478570169452
The multitude of injuries occuring in the hip joint requires vast knowledge of various operative approaches.	0.4616478506836916
No single approach exists that would permit the treatment of all injuries in an ideal fashion.	0.4908097435834394
Approaches are either considered limited (Kocher-Langenbeck, ilioinguinal iliofemoral) when they permit access only to a restricted segment of the joint, or extended (extended iliofemoral, Maryland, Ruedi) when they allow all-around visualization of the hip joint.	0.5542186195680453
The choice of the best approach for an individual patient depends on the type of injury and also on patient variables like age, preexisting disease, and concomitant injuries.	0.7018254105778433
The decision is further influenced by the timing of surgery, the kind of fracture stabilization intended and by complications typically seen with certain approaches.	0.554421792051248
The indication for extended procedures is only seen in patients with complex injury patterns involving both the anterior and the posterior column or in delayed cases undergoing surgery more than 3 weeks after trauma.	0.6259321590390752
Extended approaches permit excellent visualization of the fracture, but the extent of the soft tissue trauma is reflected in a high rate of postoperative complications.	0.9140550703619194
After a phase in which extended procedures were favored, recently a trend towards more limited approaches can be recognized because of their lower complication rate.	0.5002755538192282
This is facilitated by modern fracture-reduction methods using indirect techniques.	0.320778547118189
A relation between myocardial ischemia and induction of ventricular arrhythmias can be demonstrated in patients with coronary heart disease - in contrast to patients with primary non ischemic cardiac diseases - using a combined metabolic-electrophysiological investigation protocol consisting of programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation with simultaneous measurement of the arterio/coronary venous difference for lactate, pyruvate, free fatty acids and amino acids.	0.6684582841914154
There are significant metabolic distinctions between both ischemic and non ischemic heart disease under pacing stress conditions as well as at rest.	0.4152936414544457
A 52 year old female with Parry-Romberg syndrome presented with gradual atrophy of the subcutaneous fat and muscle on her chest and back.	0.4838996793841996
The disease process was limited to the C3 to T2 dermatomes on the right side.	0.5467651132570893
In addition, there was muscle atrophy of the right arm and extending down the back to T10, als well as right sided paralysis of the diaphragm.	0.6339430186982434
Sympathetic nerve blockage reduced pain and hyperesthesia; no progression was seen over several months using NMR to monitor the patient.	0.4426526616472136
The Parry-Romberg syndrome has been defined in many ways; in view of this unusual case, we review the literature, attempting to provide a more accurate case definition.	0.6789005173479311
Between 1990 and 1996, 129 children (mean age 4.8 years) with hip pain were examined consecutively.	0.7883048183890851
In group I (n = 100, mean age 4.14  +/-  2.2), transient synovitis of the hip was diagnosed; group II (n = 29, mean age 7.3  +/-  2.1) showed the following diagnoses: Perthes' disease (n = 12), early slipped capital femoral epiphysis (n = 5), Meyer's dysplasia (n = 2), septic arthritis of the hip (n = 2), osteomyelitis of the acetabulum (n = 1), abscess of the psoas (n = 1), chondromatosis of the hip joint (n = 1), Ewing's sarcoma of the os pubis (n = 1), hip dysplasia (n = 1).	0.6648497863793178
Three patients who had synovitis developed Perthes' disease and were assigned to group II.	0.5766770771257477
The efficiency of ultrasound, scintigraphy and MRI as diagnostic tools was tested in the examination of painful hip.	0.6063483507972701
A capsular distension was present in 73 cases and showed a significant statistical difference (t-test, P < 0.001) in group I between affected and unaffected hips.	0.6966312405845907
There were no differences in the measurements of the epiphyseal and metaphyseal width in group I between the affected and the non-affected side (t-test, P = 0.91, P = 0.57) and between the first sonographic evaluation at presentation and at the follow-up (t-test, P = 0.053, P = 0.75).	0.7057621351991319
MRI was performed, because of persistent joint effusion, in 10 cases in group I, and Perthes' disease was excluded.	0.829260783240334
In group II the use of an MRI allowed the diagnosis in 89 % of the cases.	0.7902868572429212
Sonographic examination, together with X-ray examination and serological testing, represent the first choices in the evaluation of a painful hip at presentation and in the follow-up of transient synovitis.	0.6398384680937564
MRI should always be performed when abnormalities are present at the clinical and sonographic examination, and when the X-ray does not allow a clear diagnosis.	0.6767523725341814
A 36-year old woman was presented to our hospital with congenital ventricular septal defect and one-vessel coronary artery disease (75% proximal left main coronary artery) for CABG and repair of the VSD.	0.7353772858750014
After induction, a transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) baseline examination was performed, showing a severely dilated coronary sinus (CS) measuring approximately 3 cm (abnormal >1 cm).	0.5069334991239322
We suggested a persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) draining into the CS.	0.3727225265547684
PLSVC is a common venous congenital anomaly, with a reported incidence of 0.5% in general population and in 3-5 % of patients with congenital heart defect.	1.0468700842766345
Injection of echo-contrast solution in a left arm vein, visualizing microbubbles passing through the PLSVC into the CS confirmed our suspicion.	0.3984381096389046
The diagnosis of a PLSVC and dilated CS is a contraindication for retrograde cardioplegia because of the loss of cardioplegia into the PLSVC resulting in a inadequate myocardial protection.	0.5514040901946984
It may be difficult to pass a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) through a left internal or left subclavian vein and it may be associated with arrythmias.	0.5729224949282233
A chest radiograph shows the anomalous course of the PAC along the left heart.	0.5239599210614334
Teleradiologysystems can differ considerably in their features.	0.2379253187813779
The most important differences lie in the mode of image data acquisition, data transfer, data safety aspects and the possibilities of interaction between seperate teleradiology units.	0.687663711468478
A selection of commercially available teleradiologysystems is presented and compared.	0.48254231242377105
Craniopharyngiomas are the third frequent pediatric brain tumors.	0.25675978836466345
Complications after surgical treatment are common.	0.5082148315646721
The most frequent complications are endocrine disturbances, vision field defects, deteriorated acuity, cognitive or psychological deficiency as well as significant weight gain.	0.6124118510241019
A case of complete vision loss right after surgical removal of craniopharyngioma is reported.	0.4517058081355323
Magnetic resonance image showed an edema of the chiasm.	0.3620141557787974
No damage of anatomical structure could be detected.	0.39397488300537814
Seventeen days after surgery the patient reported intermittent  visual impressions for the first time.	0.5934883689530814
Over the following weeks his visus improved to  0.5, while the chiasm edema disappeared.	0.7460536748903097
Electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) allows viszalization and quantification of calcium in the coronary arteries.	0.4731128262391605
This has been demonstrated to correlate well with the overall plaque burden in the coronary arteries.	0.6450887076566827
EBCT is, therefore, well suited for the detection of early stages of coronary atherosclerosis.	0.5655301614701571
Especially in asymptomatic patients with several risk factors, staging coronary artery disease by coronary calcium, scanning may allow prognostic assessment and guide preventive and therapeutic interventions.	0.48392012691857794
We report an unusual complication in a 53-year-old woman following ileostomy for Crohn's disease 22 years previously.	0.5687803353124472
A stenosis of the distal colonic segment was the reason for the formation and subsequent rupture of a huge colonic mucocele.	0.6600321971589894
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a ruptured mucocele of colonic origin after ileostomy.	0.6064964421892534
The brain is an important target organ for gonadal hormones.	0.5095177900784592
Estrogens have protective and trophic effects on neural systems and modulate the activity of several neurotransmitter systems.	0.3632065657829525
Initial studies support the hypothesis that estrogen therapy in menopause may have protective effects toward the development of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.	0.5431882043802658
Furthermore, estrogens may improve verbal fluency, memory, and mood in elderly women.	0.5173813108183632
Still, the available evidence is not sufficient to support general treatment recommendations with respect to estrogens and the therapeutic targets dementia and depression.	0.6380961038240056

At the lilac border of the morphoea LDF was increased to 420% of the reference value recorded for the unaffected skin of the contralateral side.	0.6161049589341322
Immediately after 13 days of antibiotic therapy (3x10 Mega penicillin G per day, i.v.)	0.5480802800772537
LDF normalized, though clinical changes were hardly apparent at this stage.	0.43935272904682315
By 6 months later, LDF was still in the normal range, and clinical signs, such as induration and hyperaemic redness, had also significantly improved.	0.5492263892931449
LDF measurements allow assessment of the therapeutic response to antibiotic therapy at a very early stage while the clinical situation is still unchanged.	0.6240359866418258
It is generally accepted that the progression of an idiopathic scoliotic deformity with a Cobb angle of between 25  ° and 40  ° can be stopped by brace treatment alone provided that the generally acknowledged criteria for the treatment concerning skeletal growth of the individual are respected.	0.681401016019835
The total costs for a department of anaesthesia amount to a fraction of the total hospital budget that is proportional to the overall number of hospital departments; this means anaesthetic departments are in general not cost drivers.	0.5495132828032548
The medical treatment of erectile dysfunction includes the systemic (oral, epidermal, intramuscular) as well as the local (intracavernosal, intraurethral) application of pharma cological agents.	0.514355724617271
Up to now only yohimbine, a well-known alpha-receptor blocking agent, and sildenafil, a newly introduced phosphodiesterase V inhibitor with predominant peripheral action, have been approved and listed in Germany.	0.6932342922967215
Other oral agents under investigation are trazodone and apomorphine (central action) as well as phentolamine (peripheral action).	0.4035934267921058
For the small group of patients with an established testosterone deficit, the epidermal or intramuscular substitution of testosterone seems to be a reasonable alternative to other therapeutic options.	0.7923605508826114
For the local application of pharmacological agents, intracavernosal injection therapy and intraurethral application ("medicated urethral system for erection", MUSE) are available.	0.5717275835349417
Currently, several promising pharmacological agents with different modes of action and routes of administration are under investigation.	0.5341469638664498
The ultimate goal of these basic and clinical research efforts is to develop a specific and "tailored" therapy for each individual patient.	0.7062183547446058
While the pharmacological therapy of erectile dysfunction will most likely continue to be the therapeutic standard for most patients, it will certainly be augmented by devices (i. e. vacuum erection devices, "functional electromyostimulation of the corpus cavernosum", FEMCC) and surgical treatment options (vascular and prosthetic surgery).	0.7205685746818054
We treated a large superficial basal cell carcinoma (ca.	0.49778421892648234
10x6 cm) on the right breast in a 48-year old woman with photodynamic terapy (PDT).	0.6790338304685989
Fractionated PDT was performed by topical application of -aminolevulinic acid (-ALA, 20%) with subsequent red light (570-750 nm; 180 J/cm2) in three sessions.	0.7516366196630099
Nearly total remission of the tumor resulted; however, a few residual neoplastic islands partly infiltrating the nipple-areola complex could be detected by photodynamic diagnosis (PDD).	0.5867844607202388
These fluorescent areas were marked, excised, and the defect was closed by a rotation advancement flap.	0.6040682283924577
Total excision of the tumor was verified histologically.	0.8565040246855343
By combining PDT and surgery, this large tumor was treated with excellent cosmetic results.	0.5641614420277953
This case demonstrates the efficiency of topical PDT with adjunctive plastic surgery controlled by PDD even in large tumors.	0.409592814982906
In a prospective trial patients were interviewed in two periods, from 1988 to 1990 and from 1993 to 1995.	0.73637789925757
Ninety out of 189 patients (47,6%) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant melanoma who noted morphological changes in a pigmented lesion reported the mole had been present at least 10 years.	0.6439072499758403
20,7% stated it was present since birth.	0.49016460353243657
156 out of 189 patients (82,5%) noticed changes in the lesion over the time.	0.5344961021791199
Growth, discolouration and elevation were the most frequent changes but no significant early sign of disease was found.	0.5635735963764985
Bleeding and crusting were found with tumor thickness >1,5 mm and thus be signs of an advanced stage.	0.6883944789204762
Almost 6 months passed until half of the patients visited a physician, either because of changes in the mole or in the lesion was detected during other medical examinations.	0.7380265992384044
In the second period of the survey from 1993 to 1995 the physician was frequently consulted earlier.	0.6199373527646589
The main reasons for the delay between identification by the patient and seeking medical cedure were lack of symptoms and the notion that the lesion was harmless.	0.7347049451507128
Only 72 out of 189 patients (38,1%) visited the physician on their own initiative.	0.5442215767464564
The primary evaluation of the "pigmental lesion" was done by a primary care physician in 57%, by a dermatologist in 32% and by others in 11% of our cases.	0.8208349323481395
A diagnosis of a non-melanoma was made and no further steps were initiated by 27% of the primary care physicians and 22,7% of the surgeons, gynecologists or internists.	0.7286640791570332
Only 5% of the dermatologists misdiagnosed the lesions.	0.5500333479026297
In the second trial period from 1993 to 1995 in all physician groups the rate of misdiagnosis increased due to changes in heathcare services in the context of privatisation in our health care system in East Germany.	0.5434589027951706
Whereas 83,2% of the patients first evaluated by dermatologists had a surgical removal of the mole within the first 2 months after consultation, the proportion for those diagnosed by non-dermatologists was only 58,5%.	0.7043977470561689
The rate of primary treatment by surgeons, often with a small safety margin, also increased.	0.695679710784788
In 45 patients with Parkinson's disease, we investigated coping behavior and its correlations to demographic and disease-related data, locus of control, depression, and psychosocial adaptation.	0.677682078322373
Active, problem oriented, and self-reorganizing strategies were predominantly used and regarded as especially helpful by the 27 men and 18 women (age: 56 years; duration of illness: 9 years).	0.6105706457607221
While age and sex were not associated with coping, external locus of control correlated positively to "depressive coping" and duration of illness correlated negatively to "distraction and self-affirmation."	0.588924139111845
Coping strategies regarded as maladaptive and a small degree of internal locus of control correlated to unfavourable results for depression and satisfaction.	0.43688819050036753
The Internet has become a powerful, international source for information, and it has shown an exponential growth because of the ease of access and the immediate availability of information.	0.6114236279585062

The Giessen Ophthalmological Picture Atlas can be reached in the Internet.	0.40331757140303687
It allows a fast search free of charge from all over the world and, therefore, offers an additional option to obtain specific ophthalmological information for various purposes.	0.5084054462920297
Even though the function of the myometrium is vital for the existence of all mammals, there is little knowledge about its ultrastructure.	0.5953146824156925
So far, only the contractile filaments actin and myosin have been identified.	0.6091963234189468
There is no evidence for the existence of other filament systems, either my means of electron microscopy or histochemically.	0.6806221216354622
The indications, operative procedure, postoperative complications and advantages of laparoscopic ileostomy and colostomy as compared with "open" enterostomy are described and demonstrated in our own patients with Crohn's disease.	0.6926705581282205
Major indications for laparoscopic enterostomy in patients with Crohn's disease are stenosis, fecal incontinence and complex anal fistulas in those with severe Crohn's proctitis.	0.46176873193221546
Most Crohn patients tolerate laparoscopic enterostomy and an increasing number demand this minimally invasive technique.	0.4146095215781616
The period of convalescence is much shorter and complications in connection with laparotomy are minimized.	0.5387369248901513
We report on a complete longitudinal rupture of the urethra in combination with a rupture of the pubic symphysis and pelvic fracture during spontaneous vaginal delivery.	0.6212539134184814
Only after stabilisation of the pelvic fracture by external skeletal fixation adaptation of the urethra was possible.	0.5956108455413468
Three weeks later after removing of the transurethral catheter a mild stress incontinence could be observed.	0.4116391678817606
In the follow up one year later the patient was completely continent.	0.9167884155389479
The cosmetic result was satisfactory.	0.3618779308768458
An unclear haematuria after delivery needs a meticulous urological examination.	0.2772492910465221
Early repair of urethral disruption minimize the risk of severe incontinence.	0.4095903174391822
Coordinated care between the trauma surgeon and urologist is required for successful treatment of this rare combined injury after birth.	0.544289176295513
The increased consumption of "ecstasy" (MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine) has also increased the number of life-threatening intoxications.	0.7333909493112104
From a Medline search of the years 1992-1996, reports were registered and evaluated.	0.5238370203249487
Besides cerebral, cardiorespiratory, renal, and hepatic symptoms, hyperthermia syndromes such as malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or the serotonin syndrome were common.	0.6202566686429435
In addition to a discussion of the intoxication symptoms and their acute and intensive-care therapy, the psychological and physiological effects of "ecstasy" will be described.	0.6466463128169263
Some historical considerations of the topic are included in this review.	0.5952551636940181
The goal of this prospective, randomised and double-blind pilot-study was to investigate the analgesic potency and the side-effects of tramadol enantiomers in clinical practice.	0.7213153524388403
One hundred patients recovering from orthopaedic surgery with a postoperative pain intensity of more than 50 on a visual analogue scale 0-100 mm (Table 1) were recruited for the study.	0.715224998317952
They were treated in a randomised, double-blind way with a maximal dose of 150 mg i.v.	0.5394580030993907
(+)-, (-)-tramadol, racemate, or 15 mg i.v.	0.8314950904954416
morphine or saline in the placebo group (5 groups, 20 patients each).	0.6757404684491158
The primary criterium of efficacy was the number of responders defined as patients with a pain reduction of at least 20 on VAS after 40 min.	0.5782976587945272
In case of pain, responders were allowed to continue with the double-blind drug up to six hours.	0.5389232501249985
The non-responders were treated with morphine as the rescue analgesic.	0.578984455297298
The secondary criterium was the incidence and severity of side-effects.	0.6004149733845373
Six patients terminated the study prematurely.	0.26373975842622677
One patient was excluded because of an allergic reaction to morphine, one patient could not be treated sufficiently with morphine, four were excluded because of protocol violations.	0.7739861816757426
There were 8 responders in the (+)-tramadol-, 6 in the (-)-tramadol- and 6 in the racemate group, 16* (P<0,05) in the morphine group, and 5 in the placebo group.	0.9242653689639349
Pain intensity after 40 min was reduced by 20 (p<0,05), 17 (p<0,05), 17 (p<0,05), 36 (p<0,01 vs placebo, p<0,05 vs (+)-, (-)-tramadol, and racemate group) and 5 mm on the VAS in the (+)-, (-)-, (+/-)-tramadol-, morphine- and placebo-group, respectively.	0.8857778836690349
Thirty eight adverse events like nausea, vomiting, PCO2-increase, and urinary retention occurred in 20 patients, most frequently in the (+)-tramadol- and morphine group.	0.7197480904420804
Sedation was significantly less profound in the (-)-tramadol group 1-4 h postoperatively.	0.8461880915762745
There were no side-effect in the tramadol racemate group.	0.6786369000764565
The enantiomers were equal to the racemate in analgesic potency, but inferior by far to morphine.	0.5764540055157282
They showed more adverse events and, hence, can not be preferred to the racemate in postoperative pain therapy.	0.6345298739657813
A 36-year-old man known as chronic alcohol abuser presently suffered from arthralgia and showed bilateral petriefied kidneys by sonography and computed tomography.	0.46162164077317047
Because of an unclear renal failure a kidney biopsy was performed and presented typical chronic renal oxalosis with massive oxalate crystal deposits, tubular atrophy and interstitital fibrosis.	0.5271739521662107
Since the man had never shown signs of hyperoxaluria in his life before, a secondary oxalosis was supposed.	0.478368501180061
The subsequently prompted exploration established a three to four times abuse of rocket fuel with cola lemonade 12 years before during the patient's army time as a marine soldier.	0.425727272696
Such fuels contain ethylene glycol (glysantin) as antifreeze commonly known to cause in toxic doses acute renal tubular necrosis with hyperoxaluria.	0.49024066739907457
The presented case, however, suggests a rare sublethal ethylene glycol poisoning with initial renal tubular damage, oxalate crystal deposition and subsequent chronic interstitial oxalate nephritis with tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis and chronic renal failure.	0.4840760587299515
Undergoing chronic hemodialysis, the patient died 5 months after the kidney biopsy diagnosis by acute heart failure.	0.7939113717645236
At autopsy, progressed chronic renal oxalosis could be confirmed.	0.42374250384073814
Decompensated oxalate cardiomyopathy with disseminated myocardial oxalate crystal deposits caused acute heart failure promoted by myocardial hypertrophy in renal hypertension.	0.36253959610898445
Insulinomas are rare tumors and account for 90 % of all endocrine pancreatic tumors.	0.7116823104833655
They typically present as a solitary tumor, but may occur in multiple sites (e.g.	0.6193557448681584
multiple endocrine neoplasia type I) or as a malignant disease in 10 % of cases and rarely as nesidioblastosis or islet cell adenomatosis.	0.7025743431679004
Neuroglucopenic symptoms lead to the diagnosis; inadequate high insulin and C-peptide secretion with hypoglycemia in the fasting test confirm the diagnosis.	0.4813284219812865
Preoperative localization is not necessary prior to the first operation.	0.6985654015731254
The standard operation is enucleation or, depending on size and location, resection.	0.5450550126064049
The treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia with a high risk of recurrence is problematic.	0.7284967185931926
Subtotal resection plus enucleation seems to be better than selective tumor resection.	0.4762817954525904
In malignant insulinomas, mostly presenting with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with hepatectomy and debulking, chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are the modalities of choice.	0.518485543637652
MR spectroscopy is the only method for non-invasive detection of various aspects of cardiac metabolism in humans.	0.6614490913148524
While the 1H nucleus of water and fat molecules is the signal source for MR imaging, the MR spectroscopic technique allows for the study of a number of other nuclei, such as 13C, 19F, 23Na, 31P, 39K and 87Rb.	0.5175440446986651
Clinical applications presently are confined to the 31P nucleus.	0.32664027719913324
31P-MR spectroscopy allows the non-invasive study of cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolites ATP and phosphocreatine.	0.5012957419632066
The phosphocreatine/ATP ratio is considered an index of the energetic state of the heart.	0.5453639220680456
Possible clinical indications include heart failure, valve disease and coronary artery disease.	0.44496970500792904
In heart failure, the phosphocreatine/ATP ratio is reduced and correlates with clinical severity, ejection fraction and prognosis.	0.5382177024187843
In mitral and aortic valve disease, a reduced phosphocreatine/ATP ratio may indicate the optimum timing for valve replacement.	0.5513885801464896
In coronary artery disease, a regional decrease of phosphocreatine during stress ("biochemical ergometry") may indicate local ischemia.	0.6669155102114213
Furthermore, absolute quantification of high-energy phosphates may allow diagnosis of myocardial viability.	0.5930665313847254
Major technical developments, leading to improved spatial and temporal resolution will be necessary to establish MR spectroscopy as a routine clinical tool.	0.5767964389158255
A retrospective and partly prospective study was conducted to analyse both clinically and cephalometrically the craniofacial growth pattern of patients with isolated and syndrome-related premature craniosynostosis after standardized fronto-orbital and midface advancement.	0.5150097732877168
The file data of 293 children with fronto-orbital advancement were evaluated over an average period of 4.4 years.	0.6239118227520037
In addition, lateral teleradiographies of 117 patients from this group were cephalometrically analysed.	0.41446915490439756
Moreover, late results of 36 children and  8 adults with midface-advancement with an average follow-up period of 4.5 years were assessed.	0.7973361660582566
In contrast to linear craniectomy and so-called lateral canthal advancement, in only 8.2% of cases (24 out of 293 patients) were relapses requiring reoperation found in this study after fronto-orbital advancement.	0.7991406842663548
The evaluations indicate that with simple forms of craniosynostosis such as trigonocephaly and plagiocephaly predominantly very good or good growth can be observed.	0.4059235259108396
Cephalometric evaluation confirmed the limited potential of growth in the area of the anterior skull base and in the midface in the presence of syndrome-related faciocraniosynostoses.	0.6501497467501937
In such cases the cephalometrically confirmed maxillary hypoplasia, which increases in severity in the following order of syndromes `Saethre-Chotzen-Crouzon-Apert-Pfeiffer', could be influenced only to a limited degree by fronto-orbital advancement.	0.5612743308637748
For this reason midface advancement is of secondary importance in children with very severe anomalies.	0.636676113036372
In the present evaluation, a high rate of relapse of midfacial hypoplasia was to be found in children and adolescents after this operation in accordance with other references.	0.81265053970583
Therefore, the indication for Le Fort III osteotomy in the growth period should be limited.	0.6164893207059606
The introduction of Perfluorochemicals into medicine and especially into the treatment of severe lung injury is a fascinating scientific task.	0.5823827459568377
Many recall the famous experiments from Clark et al.	0.2418627738680445
in 1966 when he demonstrated "liquidventilation with perfluorocarbons" in the mammal species for the first time.	0.5140503222438619
After this hallmark, perfluorocarbons were subsequently introduced in research of acute lung injury by the techniques of Total- and Partial-Liquid-Ventilation (TLV; PLV).	0.49938963603387876
Perfluorocarbons (saturated organofluorids) have unique chemical and physical properties which made them attractive substances for intraalveolar application.	0.41332609746452836
The strong C-F bindings in the perfluorocarbon molecules are responsible for their chemical stability, biochemical inertness, high capacity to dissolve respiratory gases, low surface tension and high vapor pressures.	0.5160699718580938
Furthermore, the high density of the PFC lead to radio-opacity and their distribution to dependent lung areas.	0.5372870283649381
The efficacy of PFC liquid, applied by TLV/PLV has been demonstrated in numerous animal studies using different models of acute lung injury.	0.5176851155644924
Currently, several mechanisms of action of perfluorocarbon fluids in acute lung injury are discussed: recruitment of atelectatic alveoli, prevention of endexpiratory collapse of alveoli ("liquid PEEP"), redistribution of perfusion, oxygen transport, surfactant like effects and decrease of inflammation.	0.5855853574615755
Since total liquid ventilation has been used only in experimental models of lung injury, partial liquid ventilation has been introduced successfully into clinical trials (phase I-II).	0.616337485611855
However, the results of the first randomised, controlled study of PLV in 90 adult patients suffering from severe respiratory failure (ALI/ARDS) showed no differences between PLV and conventional treatment.	0.821260649789737
Furthermore, the instillation of relatively large amounts of liquid into the lungs poses several technical challenges and may be associated with complications such as liquithoraces, pneumothoraces and hypoxia.	0.48071845731978297
Since mammal lungs are evolutionary specialised to gas exchange using atmospheric oxygen, the application of liquids, even if they transport respiratory gases very well is not physiologic.	0.5056535746337565
To overcome these unwanted side effects, we developed a technique of perfluorocarbon vaporisation in analogy to the application of inhalation anaesthetic agents.	0.5125471613261654
After resolving some technical issues, this application technique was used successfully in an animal model of acute lung injury.	0.5703488824776444
Vaporisation of perfluorohexane in a concentration of 18 Vol.% of inspired gas improved significantly oxygenation and lung compliance.	0.5033399182836508
Though these results are promising, mechanisms of action, dose-efficacy relation, surfactant-perfluorocarbon interaction or anti-inflammatory effects of vaporised perfluorohexane are still unclear.	0.5649635499121848
These questions need to be clarified before this technique can be applied clinically.	0.5725007080785981
However, the inhalation of vapor, a technique already familiar to anaesthesiologists should avoid risks of large amounts of fluids in the bronchoalveolar space.	0.5374184911927296
Furthermore, this technique can be administered by established anaesthetic equipment with the advantage of exact dosing, continuous monitoring, and demand application in a way near to clinical routine.	0.6512845697761168
VDD pacing using a single pass lead for complete heart block is well described in adults but there are few reports of its use in children.	0.515104975034991
We have used 6 different standard adult size single pass leads and 5 different pacemaker generators in 21 children and adolescents aged 3.7-17.2 years (mean 9.9 years) and weighing 13.5 to 76 kg (mean 34.3 kg).	0.7727773199816523
Congenital complete heart block was present in 14 patients (with associated heart disease in 2 of them), surgical complete heart block in 6 patients and 2:1 AV block of uncertain cause in 1 patient.	0.7322222723496249
In 10 patients, the VDD system was their first pacing system.	0.6315765880489256
In 11 of the patients, 1-6 previous systems had been used and simultaneous extraction of ventricular leads (10) and/or atrial leads (5) was performed.	0.8578699410134146
All leads were introduced via a subclavian vein puncture (using the extraction sheath when present) and the atrial dipole was placed low in the right atrium to provide slack for further growth while maintaining atrial sensing.	0.6069077197907174
Ventricular thresholds ranged from 0.2 to 0.8 V. The minimal atrial amplitude was 0.7 to 4 mV and the maximum amplitude was 2.5 to 8 mV.	0.865316845462426
There was one early micro-displacement and the lead was repositioned.	0.43030756341208043
Over a follow-up period of 2-64 months (mean 32 months), all but 1 of the patients have maintained low ventricular pacing thresholds and adequate atrial signals for reliable pacing at rest and with exercise.	0.7865996552290195
During this time some have undergone considerable growth.	0.4060452566468706

Open reduction with internal stabilization is considered to be the standard therapy for the treatment of displaced acetabular fractures.	0.7142238417080197
The internal fixation is routinely achieved by the use of plates and screws.	0.6116426219527258
The use of cerclage wires and cables as a reduction aid and definitive implant for stabilization has only occasionally been reported in the literature.	0.47226544533300924
The indication was mostly limited to use in elderly patients with insufficient bone stock.	0.5871504348144356
A newly instrument developed on the basis of a standard bone elevator is presented.	0.45226741748588106
It allows a safe, semiclosed application of a cerclage wire around the greater ischiatic notch through use of the second window of the ilioinguinal approach.	0.5462915446127903

Therapy of choice is an excision of the inflamed areas.	0.6887495020254784
Interventional duct occlusion is increasingly performed with detachable coils.	0.310585331882569
In a series of 33 patients (34 procedures), we consistently used Gianturco-coils which were the initially employed coils.	0.604095480047657
They are not securable but can be implanted in a simple manner.	0.694747355540559
The rate of embolization was high (28 %) in the first 14 procedures; however, it declined to 5 % in the last 20 patients.	0.9023743550374664
We modified the technique by partially blocking the duct, when necessary, with a catheter which was advanced from the pulmonary artery and by implanting up to three coils.	0.6811953053894353
There was only one embolization and one small residual shunt in the last 20 patients.	0.5735244767015988
The mean fluoroscopy time in these patients was 11.0  +/-  5.8 minutes and decreased to 7.0  +/-  3.2 minutes in the last 10 patients with successful closure.	0.8785941424291375
Considering our experience, we continue to recommend the use of Gianturco-coils especially in the small duct which can be closed quickliy at low cost.	0.5758461282132924
This review presents data supporting the involvement of the dopaminergic system in depressive illness.	0.5199933543624724
Neuroanatomical research, animal research and clinical studies have shown that a dysfunction of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system could be associated with depressive symptoms.	0.5906102719669863
Furthermore, the chronic administration of antidepressants in animals provokes a sensitisation and enhanced expression of dopaminergic receptors.	0.5127631586571654
Although the dopaminergic system has received little attention in biological research on depression in the last decades, current research on the dopaminergic system is about to change this situation.	0.6143294345632767
Athletes who need high endurance capacity often use training at moderately high altitude (1500-3000 m) to improve oxygen delivery and utilization because of a hypoxia-induced increase of the red blood cell volume and adaptations at the muscular level.	0.5599525865117287
As maximal heart rates decrease at high altitude and plasma lactate levels for a given workload change during prolonged exposure to high altitude, it can be difficult to control and adapt the intensity and duration of the work-outs.	0.6185718022394787
Furthermore, maximal performance capacity decreases and therefore training intensity at high altitude is usually reduced compared to training at sea level.	0.45497094326321713
To avoid these disadvantages at high altitude a concept of living at moderately high altitude and training at lower elevations, termed "live high - train low" evolved, opposing the conventional concept of "live high - train high".	0.5484022095128132
A third option using a hypobaric chamber ("live low - train low") is hardly used anymore for training athletes.	0.6601593361436054
Studies on the effects of conventional high-altitude training for the improvement of athletic performance often lack a rigorous controlled design and yield controversial results.	0.4496476606110062
Regarding the new concept of "live high - train low" there is only one controlled study on college athletes and it shows a minor advantage of this new approach compared to conventional high-altitude training.	0.6471380861889862
However, training concepts are especially important for elite competitive athletes, and controlled studies with such individuals are very difficult to perform.	0.6654016207792725
Therefore, it appears that today we cannot answer the question of whether altitude-specific physiologic factors or non-altitude-related benefits of training camps account for the success of individual athletes.	0.6656745108130782
Purpose: To answer the following questions: whether reliable detection of lesions is possible in low-field-MRI-system (Magnetom Open 0.2 T) equipped with currently available hard- and software components in comparison to high field system (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T).	0.6682667476357166
Furthermore, whether localization of lesions suspect in MR-mammography can be realized in MR system of low field (Magnetom Open 0.2 T).	0.6081322780013717
Patients and Methods: In 11 patients, suspect lesions were diagnosed in diagnostic MR-mammography acquired with high field system (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T) and were compared to low field MR-mammographies of 0.2 T (Magnetom Open 0.2 T).	0.6950486045655171
In six of the 11 patients a suspect lesion was localized using wire marking.	0.47227685745125403
Results: All lesions considered suspect in diagnostic MR-mammography (Magnetom Impact 1.0 T) were also clearly identified in the 0.2 T system (Magnetom Open).	0.6901393544698335
In six cases wire marking was performed without any complications and with an accuracy of K 0.5 cm distance to the lesion.	0.6439227914904664
Conclusion: Although studies in the 0.2 T system clearly showed inferior SNR (34.6 vs. 83.1) and CNR (14.6 vs. 43.5) compared to studies with the high field system, all lesions considered suspect in diagnostic MR-mammography were reliably identified also in 0.2 T studies.	0.7280856806371612
Due to its open construction permitting permanent access to the breast and due to sufficient image quality, the Magnetom Open is suitable for interventions on the breast.	0.5751153607647826
Children with limb deficiencies or amputations of the lower extremities should be enabled to stand or to walk according to their state of development, because just standing and walking are among the most important preconditions for the best possible integration.	0.6471802455617788
Supply them with a prosthesis, orthesis and orthoprosthesis is therefore indispensable for rehabilitation.	0.4194335393792634
While a prosthesis replaces parts of the extremities, orthesis stabilizes the existing extremity.	0.48848351984993543
Orthoprostheses compensate longitudinal malformations, have a supporting effect, allow growth to be controlled and compensate for shortening.	0.578944650084093

After inoculation new HIV is produced after 24 hours, and HIV has spread over the whole organism by the end of one or two weeks.	0.6990047804595091
HIV infection may be detected after four to twelve weeks by antibody assays, and after eleven days by nucleic acid based assays.	0.6016628477678471
Anti-HIV production might be slowed down under initial therapy.	0.25650388673125885
In addition to psychiatric outpatient treatment, the detoxification of alcoholics in psychiatric hospitals is an important link between medical detoxification and psychosocial inpatient treatment aiming at abstinence.	0.5762871725106706
Integrated models of inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy focus on improvement of the motivation of patients towards further treatment of their alcoholism and towards abstinence.	0.49294138838455315
In our study 529 alcoholics underwent such treatment lasting between 2 to 3 weeks.	0.5134093596532161
A total of 469 patients (89%) were followed up after 8  months; 242 alcoholics (52% of the follow-up sample; 46% of the whole sample) achieved the treatment goal and started further treatment, mainly as inpatients.	0.7371826951127292
Fifty-four of these patients relapsed before they started further alcoholism treatment, but achieved abstinence afterwards; 60 (25%) of these 242 patients relapsed after the specific alcoholism therapy; 227 alcoholics did not start further treatment after the initial detoxification and motivation therapy.	0.6516627739693645
In this subpopulation, 113 (50%) relapsed during the follow-up period.	0.5495335352860437
Although this is not a controlled study, it can be concluded that integrated inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy has positive effects on the treatment behavior of alcoholic patients and enhances the probability of further abstinence.	0.6799047905918986
In this article we report a very rare case of simultaneous and bilateral rupture of the quadriceps tendon in a 38-year-old patient.	0.7170757589039203

Neuroendocrine tumors of the thymus, also known as thymic carcinoids, are rare tumors of the anterior mediastinum.	0.8354897139446991
They occur sporadically or in association with the MEN I syndrome.	0.39206999920018276
We present five patients (four male, one female; age of first manifestation 19-53 years) who were operated on at our hospital between 1984 and 1995 for neuroendocrine thymic tumors.	0.6982662218045552
A hormone-producing tumor presented with Cushing's syndrome in two patients.	0.44040840960101146
Two patients had MEN I syndrome.	0.38746263336174785
Only in the female patient the primary tumor was confined to the thymus.	0.7410595191750369
We found lymph node metastases in three patients and a distant metastasis in one.	0.6571295858620855
The neuroendocrine tumors have a high rate of local recurrences and thus we performed 11 operations using a transthoracic or transsternal approach.	0.5182301955887562
Since there was no operative mortality and adjuvant therapies are of limited value, we recommend surgery even in case of recurrence.	0.6740131866786854

The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was based on the neuroleptical blockade of central dopamine D2 receptors.	0.45218097222432985
Brain imaging studies, however, generally failed to demonstrate a significant increase in central D2 receptors among schizophrenic patients.	0.508100958991542
Using a novel approach, the group of Laruelle and Abi-Dargham was now able to demonstrate that schizophrenic patients have increased synaptic dopamine concentrations in the striatum.	0.5900617537701649
Endogenous dopamine competes with a radioligand for binding at dopamine D2 receptors; compared to healthy control subjects, blockade of dopamine production in neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients induced a significantly higher increase in D2 binding of the infused radioligand, indicating higher endogenous synaptic dopamine.	0.4451540723210191
A similar increase in D2 binding was also observed in drug-free schizophrenics who had previously been treated with neuroleptics; these patients also showed an increased density of striatal D2 receptors, most likely due to counteradaptive upregulation of D2 receptors during neuroleptic medication.	0.585130992225337

This report describes a case of renal oncocytomatosis found at autopsy.	0.5543730864789368
In addition, we found an adrenal adenoma, a pheochromocytoma and thoracic cicatrices 4 years after curatively resected large cell carcinoma of the lung.	0.7502054004887656
In the distal renal tubules we found oncocytic epithelial cells, with partial transition into microoncocytomas.	0.5593900299588117
Immunhistochemically, these and the main oncocytomas were CD 10 negative.	0.5277839852106889
These findings support the origin of oncocytoma from oncocytically transformed distal tubular epithelium.	0.3580617470933579

Malignant bone tumors require the same careful staging as, for example, lung cancer.	0.6216789697055111
However, well-established staging systems for non-osseous tumors are not suitable for bone tumors.	0.6251283129541123
Therefore we present Enneking's staging system for malign bone tumors here, which is better adapted to the special problems of these entities because it integrates clinical, radiological and histological findings.	0.6321120802825894
The weak points of Enneking's staging system (e.g.	0.24927548077648545
inflexibility, changes in radiological modalities in the past 20 years) are discussed.	0.7650472883223627
Efficient analgesia may be the major objective in the cardiovascular risk patient following myocardial infarction, acute occlusion of peripheral vessels, or dissection/perforation of major abdominal vessels.	0.6161819062134491
It was the purpose of the study to investigate the haemodynamic and respiratory side effects of eight different opioids in 57 circulatory risk patients prior to major vascular surgery.	0.8172523020676328
Patients were randomly allocated to eight groups, each receiving a different opioid within a clinical, equipotent dose range (buprenorphine, fentanyl, morphine, nalbuphine, pentazocine, pethidine, tramadol, alfentanil).	0.4779816412542791
A complete haemodynamic and blood gas status was obtained prior to as well as 5, 10, 15, and 20 min following opioid administration.	0.7029087336902109
Monitoring included a complete invasive haemodynamic and blood gas status.	0.34091933767403987
Statistical evaluation was performed by 1- and 2-factorial ANOVA (P<0.05).	0.7308526808385988
Significant time effects (changes from baseline at the time of measurement) were observed for heart rate and total peripheral resistance, while significant group (group-specific differences in the course of values at the different times of measurements) and time effects were noted for mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, stroke volume index, and PaO2.	0.776380759332812
No major effects were observed following morphine, fentanyl, alfentanil, tramadol, and nalbuphine.	0.532599151702397
Buprenorphine caused distinct respiratory depression accompanied by an increase in pulmonary vascular tone.	0.4598606869194288
Pentazocine and pethidine caused a significant increase in MPAP and peripheral vascular resistance while pethidine also produced marked respiratory depression.	0.3754327230856435
For interpretation of the results, factors such as respiratory depression, histamine release, secretion of endogenous catecholamines, and hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction have to be discussed.	0.6147035980009312
Tramadol, an opioid with moderate potency, seems to offer some advantages due to its minor cardiovascular and respiratory side effects.	0.5969407992174564
In this article we report a case of an early postoperative compartment syndrome of the anterior tibial compartment with complete sensomotoric palsy of the peroneal nerve after arthroscopic-assisted replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee.	0.7349858635089715
The tourniquet pressure was 360 mm Hg and operation time was 1.75 h. After the operation the leg was bandaged to avoid swelling of the leg and as antithrombotic prophylaxis.	0.6567350228593546
Analgesic therapy was by continuous epidural bupivacaine infusion.	0.330678180444345
Increasing pain of the lower leg was suppressed by additional analgesia.	0.6927038259104082
Due to persistent pain despite regular analgesia, the patient was sent to a main hospital on the 3rd postoperative day, where an extremely painful and swollen anterior tibial compartment with intracompartimental pressure of over 100 mm Hg was found.	0.6365878649795036
The compartment was released immediately.	0.23843562346896482
Despite the appearance of severe muscle damage, no extensive débridement was done.	0.5829501194271403
At the second examination, at 48 h, there was minimal perfusion of the muscles without contraction and islands of ischemic necrosis.	0.6801500395251112
Clinically, there was complete palsy of the dorsiflexors of the foot.	0.6474783950859575
The case shows the danger of a compartment syndrome when tourniquet of the limb, arthroscopy and a firm bandage are combined.	0.48111591242844215

Two patients with tonsure alopecia, associated in one case with trichotillomania of the pubic hair and in the other with enuresis, are presented.	0.8105822519313463
The aim of the following study was to develop an osteoporotic model by means of ovariectomy.	0.8805873194336701
Bone mineral density of the upper and lower jaw was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DPX) before and after ovariectomy.	0.568361147466029
Histomorphometric measurements were done by a microtomography system.	0.4660563687623294
Bone mineral density decreased significantly after ovariectomy in the upper and lower jaw.	0.5580040875117069
There is evidence for the community effectiveness of preventive geriatric intervention programs prior to the need for help or long-term care from a couple of prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs).	0.6240181256370224
For geriatric rehabilitation programs tailored to older people with imminent or manifest need for long-term care analogous - evidence is still lacking.	0.5484289525723012
The nation-wide leading boards of the FRG's Sickness Insurance Administration in conjunction with its Central Medical Service have formulated guidelines for the formation of a nation-wide ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to realize the postulate of the long-term care insurance legislation "rehabilitation prior to long-term care".	0.5596567160185894
These guidelines must be proven empirically.	0.23629231323704797
To prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the foreseen ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service, the RCT design would be highly desirable.	0.5937099068415413
Unfortunately, the prerequisites in the field of methodology are poor since valid, reproducible and feasible criteria for the selection of suitable patients and measurement criteria which meet the requirement of proven medium-term sensitivity to change do not yet exist.	0.5591542616225764
Nevertheless, there is a great and urgent need, for the first time, to investigate the cost-effectiveness ratio for this ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to be established in the FRG, leaving aside the methodologic desiderata of randomized control-groups.	0.7740487118926027
"Idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia is an exclusion diagnosis.	0.34214104534119066
The underlying reasons and mechanisms of "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardias are still not completely understood.	0.591075217395642
Recent investigations showed a high prevalence of morphological abnormalities in the right ventricle of patients with "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia out of the right ventricular outflow tract, which could often be correlated with the origin of the ventricular tachycardia.	0.8708722002319729
These described abnormalities were not uniform.	0.2592061265749027
Here we report about a patient suffering from drug-refractory "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia for 10 years.	0.49911243068709366
This is the first report in which the origin of an "idiopathic" ventricular tachycardia could be localized by right-ventricular angiography, magnetic resonance tomography and electrophysiological study in the area of an interventricular septal thickening of the right ventricular outflow tract and cured by radiofrequency catheter ablation.	0.6507303063919486
Fetal teratomas are extra- or intracorporal congenital malformations with different localization.	0.5584322720532401
Although they are rare, they may provoke severe obstetrical complications if they are not prenatally diagnosed.	0.6656142887659466
If sonographic examination of fetal teratomas is performed, it is necessary to evaluate the further development of pregnancy for fetal outcome and pregnancy aspects in relationship to the localization, size and ultrasound criteria of the tumor.	0.6552085992744823
Sonographic findings reveal the criteria and conditions for conservative or invasive management or reasons for continuing or terminating the pregnancy.	0.38978123252151003
Prenatal ultrasound examination is the only possibility to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality, as exemplified by 8 prenatally examined fetal teratomas.	0.6658861227912719
We report on a 62-year-old female patient with melena in which polypoid lesions of the cecum were discovered endoscopically.	0.5854789743688332
Histological examination of mucosal biopsies revealed an inflammatory process with lots of histiocytes and so-called Michaelis-Gutmann bodies, leading to the diagnosis of a malakoplakia of the colon.	0.5664298471211925
No other organs were found affected.	0.335261575157262
In the course of an antibiotic therapy, there was no melena detectable over a period of six months.	0.6387354709972829
Malakoplakia, an inflammation usually affecting the urogenital tract, is rarely found in the colon, with only 35 cases published until now.	0.7597230776373339
It is frequently associated with other diseases like neoplastic or inflammatory disorders, immune defect syndromes or heroin abuse.	0.4077356278103968
This spectrum is expanded by our report in which a long-standing alcohol abuse was found as an attendant disease.	0.6296765334881157
Unilateral laterothoracic exanthem a (ULE) is a self-limited, probably infectious-allergic skin disease predominately affecting small children.	0.5770143823606712
We describe five such cases.	0.2060054608823048
The typical unilaterally located or at least unilaterally dominant exanthem usually starts in the axillary region and is characterized by red, partly confluent papules and fine scales.	0.48381182198390477
Two of the children presented with atypical manifestations of ULE.	0.5922139535720716
Due to its asymptomatic course, therapy is not necessary in the majority of cases.	0.9511135082352846
Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is now an accepted alternative to conventional adrenalectomy.	0.4808511770908817
As in open surgery, several different endoscopic approaches to the adrenal glands have been described.	0.5902296551122059
In principle, one must distinguish between the laparoscopic and the retroperitoneoscopic access.	0.5208184965544713
All adrenal tumors - pheochromocytomas included - except adrenal carcinomas can be removed endoscopically.	0.5076572156048099
However, the use of these techniques is limited in patients with particularly large tumors.	0.7821286356825665
The results reported to date are convincing.	0.43300672103719184
Only limited data are available as yet to compare conventional and endoscopic adrenalectomy.	0.48957516066234963
Because adrenal diseases requiring surgery are rare, endoscopic adrenalectomy is an operation that, for the present, will be limited to centers with a particular interest in laparoscopic and endocrine surgery.	0.6856372773589338
Economic evaluations have become more and more important in the somatotherapeutic field.	0.5231756053277755
This survey's objective was to examine if the current economic evaluation techniques can be applied to psychotherapy.	0.609509234624452
8 data banks, 17 key words from the psychotherapeutic field and 14 economic key words were used, the identified original studies were classified in accordance with Drummond, the methodical quality of each study was assessed at a score between 0 and 10 points.	0.5729584823475434
21 studies were found: 16 cost- benefit analyses, 4 cost-effectiveness analyses and one cost-utility analysis.	0.5826333992462192
The quality of the representation of the clinical results (mean value 8.6) was better than that of the economic results (mean value 6.1).	1.0199453414633384
It was perfectly possible to evaluate psychotherapeutic interventions with regard to economic aspects by means of the current techniques but in most cases there was a considerable lack of quality in both representation and calculation.	0.6441407313677294
Furthermore the evaluation type of cost-utility analysis, which is the only one that takes quality of life aspects into consideration and therewith seems to be the most appropriate approach regarding the psychotherapeutic field, has been greatly ignored.	0.7783911708263536
As a net effect of ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) cardioprotection due to vasodilative (reduction of blood pressure, afterload reduction), antiproliferative (reduced cell growth, reduction of "vascular" andor "ventricular remodeling", reduced formation of extracellular matrix), as well as antiadrenergic actions and due to the stimulating effect on natriuresis, reduction of blood pressure, preload reduction can be expected.	0.5447852735759211
These aims of therapy have mostly been confirmed for the action of ACE-inhibitors by experimental and clinical studies but except for the treatment of arterial hypertension and few preliminary reports concerning the treatment of cardiac dysfunction, no comparable data are available for AT1-receptor antagonists.	0.6961155657270638
To date, an antithrombotic and profibrinolytic action could only be demonstrated for ACE-inhibitors.	0.5331787309334702
This effect has been discussed to be responsible for the improvement of long-term prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease.	0.7257941845440463
Despite the similar spectrum of action there exist important differences between ACE-inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists that might underline the need of an individual use of these drugs: the dual action of ACE-inhibitors on the RAS and the kinin system bears many benefits but has been also shown to be accompanied by side-effects, mainly chronic dry cough, in a relatively high percentage of patients thus leading to discontinuation of therapy in 8-14%.	0.6716557232965186
This respective side-effect can be prevented by the use of AT1-receptor antagonists.	0.5493088240164068
It has been discussed whether the incomplete action of ACE-inhibitors on AT1-receptor-mediated effects is at least in part responsible for the efficacy of this drug which is relatively high (75-80%) as compared to other substances.	0.8043586413103399
Due to their direct action, AT1-receptor-blockers might also be of high effectiveness for the treatment of severe heart failure.	0.6369871118203707
A combination of the ACE-inhibitor-mediated activation of the kinin-system with the more specific blockade of AT1-receptors by AT1-receptor antagonists might be of benefit and is currently under investigation.	0.5997706803452606
Finally, it has been discussed that the incresed AT II concentration in case of AT1-receptor-blockade activates AT2-receptor-mediated mechanisms thus leading to an additive vasoprotective effect.	0.6831016912493831
An isomorphic response is defined as a nonspecific skin stimulus eliciting a disease-specific skin reaction.	0.46508663677480006

The presence of nicotine in sweat obtained from smokers and one non-smoker exposed to tobacco smoke after 4 h to 8 days of nicotine-free time was investigated.	0.41037357602337665
Following stimulation of the eccrine glands, sweat samples were taken every hour for 6 h.The total nicotine concentrations, i.e.	0.47700749847072244
the sum of nicotine and its metabolites, were determined by radioimmunoassay.	0.6552415480967083
The presence of unchanged nicotine was revealed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.	0.36840694803923213
Up to now there is no specific treatment targeting the ultimate cause of interstitial cystitis (IC), since its pathogenesis and etiology are still unknown.	0.6212464298834379
Most studies focussing on oral medication have not been randomized, double-blinded or placebo-controlled.	0.5387412982810266
Numerous case reports and intent-to-treat trials are lacking a systematic approach and do not meet evidence-based medicine criteria.	0.538531083411908
Consequently there is as yet no standard oral therapy available for the treatment of IC.	0.4613454190129379
Differential radiomodification induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) is proving to be a feasible modality for optimizing tumor radiotherapy.	0.8111606537905164
Our earlier work on Ehrlich ascites tumor cells has shown that pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives increases the uptake and phosphorylation of 2-DG.	0.4573445317564677
Moreover, the alteration induced in bioenergetic profile was more drastic and less reversible.	0.466630642653025
The promising combination of hematoporphyrin derivatives and 2-DG has been further evaluated in the Ehrlich ascites tumor bearing mice for determining the effects on radiotherapeutic response.	0.5499219764693115
Solid tumors (average volume = 0.9 +/- 0.1 cm3) implanted in Swiss-albino strain "A" mice were focally irradiated (10 Gy) using 60Co teletherapy.	0.6975463111998925
Tumor bioenergetics was assessed by 31P MR spectroscopy.	0.3670090643291278
The uptake and phosphorylation of 2-DG was observed to be increased following pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives.	0.5844467256837489
Upon hematoporphyrin derivatives + 2-DG treatment followed by irridiation, the intracellular pH reduced and a remarkable increase in glycerophosphorylcholine and inorganic phosphate levels was observed.	0.48307173542969484
The present study demonstrates the potential of hematoporphyrin derivative pretreatment in increasing the bioavailability of 2-DG in a mice Ehrlich ascites tumor model.	0.5881116804745518
The finding may have interesting clinical implications in the form of increased manifestation of the radiation-induced damage in the case of use of these drugs as a potential adjuvant in radiotherapy of tumors.	0.6394671127238304
The novel Lenz (1835) by the German author, social revolutionist and physician Georg Büchner (1813-1837) can be regarded as a prominent document in the history of medicine.	0.575310345294221
On the one hand, Büchner's description of a schizophrenic disorder meets recent criteria; on the other, he hints at the physician's modern general attitude toward the patient.	0.6029678233089835
The latter is derived from his philosophy of art and political motives.	0.4279440524639898
The hypothesis is discussed that a dysfunction of the descending antinociceptive system may underly the pain of fibromyalgia.	0.4881850504546592
Data from animal experimentation show that an interruption of the system by spinal cord cooling leads to (1) increase in ongoing activity,  (2) lowering in stimulation threshold, and (3) increase in response magnitude in nociceptive dorsal horn neurons.	0.6682849620508104
The influence of the descending system was stronger on the responses to input from deep nociceptors than to input from cutaneous nociceptors.	0.506368590147186
If similar changes occur also in patients, an impairment of the tonicly active descending system should be followed by (1) spontaneous pain (ongoing activity), (2) tenderness (lowering in mechanical threshold), and (3) hyperalgesia (increased responses to noxious stimuli).	0.614880855953519
These changes should affect mainly deep pain, because the antinociceptive system influences predominantly input from deep nociceptors.	0.47216016702796465
Animal experiments with microbiologic examinations and studies in cell cultures have shown that ionomer cement is a biocompatible and biostable bone replacement material in the head and neck region.	0.43593627825500525
Clinical and functional results of its use in the human middle ear have proven to be satisfactory during a maximal period of 2.5 years observation.	0.79406370683023
The present trial was continued in order to determine the long-term behavior of ionomer cement (Ionos partial and total ossicles) after reconstruction of the ossicular chain.	0.5857771475664684
The ossicular chain was reconstructed in 343 cases and included various losses of one or more of the ossicles (i.e., incus, incus and malleus, incus and stapes superstructure, and malleus, incus and stapes superstructure).	0.5385646313925698
Follow-up extended over a maximum period of 5.5 years.	0.7715125879749036
Patients were examined under a surgical microscope and a pure-tone audiogram was performed at regular intervals.	0.6036639246610704
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is not presently performed in Germany.	0.6282166446355045
According to PGD's opponents there, existing laws for the protection of embryos forbid this type of diagnostics.	0.4173104170824849
Proponents feel that these laws do not stand in the way of PGD, depending on legal viewpoint.	0.43036673969792166
This controversy has hindered PGD's application in Germany.	0.24145486543105968
The nature of this longstanding, emotional discussion is not easy to describe to scientists abroad.	0.48887607103006264
This retrospective study investigated the stability of the small AO external fixator in a radioradial configuration used in the treatment of 42 mostly unstable distal radius fractures (types A-3.2, C-1.2 and C-2.1 according to the AO classification).	0.7782678378016026
No bone grafting was performed.	0.3306743255046277
All cases were documented with antero-posterior and lateral X-rays preoperatively, 0, 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively and after consolidation.	0.84520210276639
Early functional aftertreatment was started one week after surgery.	0.3937474585634658
Thirty-six fractures showed a dorsal comminution, combined with osteopenia in 18 cases.	0.6053094815754103
The mean preoperative radial angle of 17 ° was normalized to 25 ° postoperatively.	0.39282151614482436
The mean preoperative volar angle of minus 30 ° was reduced to 12 ° postoperatively.	0.4802592416136987
None of these mean angles changed until consolidation.	0.3712475026188764
The external fixator was removed on average after 7 weeks (range 6-10 weeks) depending on the radiological fracture healing.	0.6422012277673588
The small AO external fixator in a radioradial configuration proved to be stable enough for early functional aftertreatment of the wrist.	0.42080621282277275
Its stability is related to a proper operative technique and correct indication (unstable Colles type with one or two distal fragments).	0.5419308489457183
Bone grafting is unnecessary if the external fixator is left in situ until bony consolidation.	0.46529325891902845
Purpose: To develop and implement a method to obtain digital subtraction (DS) spiral computed tomography angiograms (SCTA) in order to avoid superimposition of bony structures and vascular calcifications on SCTA maximum intensity projections (MIPs) and shaded surface display (SSD).	0.5445034911214568
The concept of small-volume resuscitation, the rapid infusion of a small volume (4 ml/kg BW) of hyperosmolar 7.2-7.5% saline solution for the initial therapy of severe hypovolemia and shock was advocated more than a decade ago.	0.8801373516475155
Numerous publications have established that hyperosmolar saline solution can restore arterial blood pressure, cardiac index and oxygen delivery as well as organ perfusion to pre-shock values.	0.5173559587117768
Most prehospital studies failed to yield conclusive results with respect to a reduction in overall mortality.	0.43541743360076907
A meta-analysis of preclinical studies from North and South America, however, has indicated an increase in survival rate by 5.1% following small-volume resuscitation when compared to standard of care.	0.5921076267688717
Moreover, small-volume resuscitation appears to be of specific impact in patients suffering from head injuries with increased ICP and in severest trauma requiring immediate surgical intervention.	0.5654905944762474
The utility of electron beam computed tomography (EBT) to estimate cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated.	0.666188844976437
Eleven patients with suspected acute cerebral ischemia were investigated.	0.5825038309586187
The EBT was performed with an acquisition time of 50 ms per slice at eight parallel levels.	0.4813908107830771
To compare signal/noise and contrast/ noise ratios the data from the EBT investigation were compared to a similar examination on a spiral CT.	0.5712735488456084
The signal/noise ratio with EBT was about 30%, the contrast/noise ratio 25% of that with spiral CT.	0.6746640683319148
The absolute values of CBV were 4.9 +/- 1.2 ml/100 g (EBT); CBF was 50.5 +/- 7.0 ml/100 g/min in normal contralateral brain tissue.	0.6272203399659532
In four patients with proven infarcts on follow-up, the ischemic areas had a CBV ranging from 1.7 to 3.8 ml/100 g, while CBF ranged from 9.4 to 24.5 ml/100 g/min.	0.8025294826627668
Using a bolus injection of contrast material, calculation of absolute CBV and CBF is feasible using EBT.	0.4202584153356537
Advantages of EBT are the absolute measurements possible and it's multislice capability.	0.43280796488317863
Disadvantages, however, are caused by the high image noise, limiting the demarcation of ischemic tissue.	0.5300922098233908
The report, in two parts, sums up the findings of a survey covering 52 cities in Central Europe.	0.704476727988757
Most administrations have imposed a ban on feeding street pigeons, but this has been more or less unsuccessful.	0.5464459408293594
Information campaigns were used on a large scale, along with more controversial methods such as catching the birds or shooting them down, providing pigeon houses, administering hormone preparations, chemosterilization, and exclusion from buildings.	0.4376589989254084
Few attempts were made to reduce the number of breeding places.	0.4527299378745968
Population reduction by poisons or natural enemies seems to be negligible.	0.3208446543348533
We report a rare case of an accident during which a pedestrian was hit by a car and was thrown through the windscreen into the front seat.	0.5452038264586425
Apart from the high speed (100 km/h or more) the traumatic amputation of both lower legs and the resulting reduced angular momentum mainly contributed to the final position of the pedestrian in the vehicle.	0.652502750158985
In addition, the low height of the person standing in front of the vehicle is deemed to have been a supporting factor for the course of the accident.	0.6822266021829126
A 41-year-old woman with severe juvenile diabetes mellitus suffered from profund hypothermia after loss of thermoregulation in diabetic ketoacidosis.	0.43234379981672744
She was found unconscious, without measurable blood pressure; the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed bradycardia of 30/min and the rectal temperature was 23.7  °C.	0.6768799775853743
The patient received mechanical ventilation, fluid therapy, warmed gastric lavage, and, unfortunately, inotropic medication.	0.6065479633001056
She was transferred to a department of cardiac surgery in order to continue the therapy with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	0.5136254889722415
On arrival, the patient had a rectal temperature of 27.3  °C, the ECG showed an absolute arrhythmia with a frequency of 70/min, and the blood pressure was 63/43 mm Hg.	0.921731385693829
We decided to use a rapidly available but not highly invasive venovenous hemofiltration technique for slowly rewarming the patient.	0.38932027855838325
Vascular access was achieved by percutaneous femoral vein cannulation with a Shaldon catheter.	0.41967387215341073
The hemofiltration system (Gambro AK-10, Gambro AB, Sweden) was instituted with a blood flow rate of 200 ml/min.	0.5681886065497289
The hemofiltration monitor controls the pumps for filtering and substituting fluid volumes and allows the infusion solutions to be heated up to 40  °C.	0.34711085173376655
Sinus rhythm resumed without antiarrhythmic medications at a temperature of 29.5  °C, and within 8 h the patient was rewarmed to 35.5  °C.	0.7871180893641232
After treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome caused by pneumonia, she was discharged from the intensive care unit to complete treatment with no evidence of any permanent organ damage.	0.7110515645556432
We conclude that hemofiltration may be the method of choice for rewarming deeply hypothermic patients when their circulation is preserved.	0.5392749527257409
Under these circumstances, it is preferable to external rewarming techniques, as it avoids the disadvantages of temperature afterdrop and rewarming shock.	0.6563252045596584
Rewarming rates of 1.5  °C/h seem to be adequate.	0.8551109990451276
Hemofiltration systems are more widespread, less invasive, and easier to handle compared to CPB techniques, which should be preferred in situations of prolonged unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation with cardiac arrest and deep core temperatures.	0.6629617626698098
We report an unusual injury of the face caused by the spoke of an automatic telescoping umbrella that come loose when the umbrella was opened.	0.5576082504816332
Due to the shot-like force of the spoke, the left nostril, septum and right wall of the nasal cavity were pierced.	0.6172127076301901
The part with the joint penetrated into the maxillary antrum.	0.3591128765061166
In order to remove the spoke, wire scissors had to be used to cuff off the spoke's joint inside the surgically opened maxillary sinus.	0.5529600603478304
Seven patients with pulmonary metastases of malignant melanoma were treated with inhalation therapy with 36 million IU interleukin-2 for six months.	0.6546423372237812
Inhalation therapy was combined with four bolus infusions of DTIC at a dose of 850 mg/m2 once every four weeks.	0.530594317120496
Response rates were 71,4% with 2 patients achieving a complete remission (CR), 2 partial remissions (PR), 1 stable disease (SD), and 2 progressing disease (PD).	0.7088264180724271
Therapy was well tolerated with low toxicity.	0.5078861341820158
Six of the patients developed cough; one patient was slightly feverish.	0.9784555102096795

The original reason for using the German "Habilitation" degree to mean that a candidade had qualified and could conduct research and teach at a university is no longer really valid, as this is being threatened by its importance to further careers.	0.5269502527330014
Medical faculties must discuss how this development can be curtailed.	0.3378401391907035
In order to check the current situation, the Habilitation degree systems of 36 medical faculties of German universities were compared with the aid of a scoring system.	0.6270021777347068
Conformity existed only in the demand for a doctoral dissertation, scientific publications and a lecture on approval.	0.48086411315840555
Concerning other criteria for qualification there was decreasing consensus in the following order: Habilitation thesis, commitment to teaching, further professional education, participation in congresses, inaugural lecture, qualification to teach, scientific activity, broad background in the discipline, and introduction to the faculty.	0.5178882050177017
Application of the scoring system with a maximum of 33 score points resulted in a mean value of 15.2 points and a range from 6 to 29 points.	0.7023997523734995
A significant decrease in the score values occurred with increasing age of the Habilitation degree (P = 0.002).	0.6177268990465165
Even if scoring systems are ambiguous and unfair, our analysis revealed serious differences in the quality of the Habilitation degree.	0.5610054061343136
Presuming that the German Habilitation degree should be maintained as a high-level qualification, we developed proposals that might be used to standardize this academic examination.	0.6969314432286461
Chronic reduction in uteroplacental blood flow causes intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).	0.32337752037762746
In an animal model fetal umbilical perfusion in experimentally induced IUGR was examined.	0.38463801406716813
Pregnant sheep were instrumented with externally adjustable occluders on the common internal iliac artery to regulate uterine blood flow in the last third of gestation.	0.5246383270638847
Flow probes on the uterine arteries and the common umbilical artery provided blood flow measurements.	0.4242009773700458
Uterine blood flow was restricted in the group destined to become growth retarded whereas uterine blood flow in the equally instrumented controls was allowed to rise normally.	0.5268391609575327
When the experiment was terminated and morphometric data were obtained, uterine blood flow in controls was significantly higher than in restricted animals.	0.5846184542677586
Body weight and ponderal index in fetuses of flow-restricted mothers was significantly lower than in controls.	0.517270841631295

Prognostic assessment of acute global cerebral anoxia following cardiorespiratory arrest requiresa high level of clinical and technical diagnostic skills.	0.46480985974393896
Statements regarding prognosis of this form of coma can be made only with reference toa large number of clinical, neurophysiological, biochemical, and cerebral imaging data.	0.5828930009817304
Previous research in this field has usually been restricted to only one or a few parameters such as clinical data, EEG findings, evoked potentials or biochemical markers.	0.5439461539054786
The present compilation of the various aspects regarding diagnosis and prognosis is intended to define the present state of the art in diagnosis and prognosis of anoxic coma, and also serve as a basis for a multicenter prospective study including all of the relevant data to improve diagnosis and arrive at guidelines for effective prognostication of anoxic coma.	0.7446355048299227
In 96 patients (ductal pancreatic carcinoma, n = 34; periampullary carcinoma, n = 43; chronic pancreatitis, n = 19) the role of CA 19-9 in the diagnosis of lesions of the head of the pancreas were evaluated.	0.6438226887478613
The sensitivity for ductal pancreatic carcinoma was 73.3 %, for periampullary carcinoma 48.8 %, and specificity was 63.2 %.	0.6784906529141573
Carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated only in every fifth patient.	0.3629932510912589
Even when combining the two tumor markers no increase in sensitivity could be observed.	0.3578378242713763
The low specificity of 63 %, which decreased to 33 % in the case of obstructive jaundice, does not allow adequate preoperative differentiation between cancer patients and those with chronic pancreatitis.	0.7263911746264976
In cases of postoperatively elevated CA 19-9 level the prognosis is worse than in patients with normal tumor markers.	0.5950916853903723
The management of neuromuscular foot deformities in children and adolescents must be individualized because of differences in etiology and pathomechanics.	0.51711930295454

The general aim should be an optimization of functions and only rarely to achieve a normal foot.	0.5786563635914812
The basic principles of management can be described as correction of deformity, stabilization of unstable joints and balance of muscle power.	0.5821579253447277
This study was carried out from 1986 to 1996 to evaluate the technique of translaminal epidural endoscopic discectomy in lumbar hernias occupying over 50% of the radicular canal, foraminal hernias, and hernias invading it entirely.	0.6180441106396566
This minimally invasive arthroscopic technique was applied in patients suffering from degenerative lumbar stenosis between L3 and S1.	0.36945142272265924
The first part of the study dealt with lumbar hernias.	0.6173025054632323
Of a total of 222 patients, 175 (78.82%) showed radicular canal invasion ranging between 50 and 90%.	0.6366887298915301
The disc level was L4-L5 in 59%, L5-S1 in 39%, and L3-L4 in 4%.	0.4651503978650402
Most of these hernias were lateral extrusions.	0.4375849753030685
However, the study also included protrusions and foraminal hernias, since they were large and technically difficult to operate on.	0.6761697542085573
In terms of distribution,  25 patients (14.28%) had protrusions and 120 (68.57%) extrusions, and in 30 patients (17.14%) hernias had migrated.	0.8882751680475067

The aim of this study was to evaluate the retropatellar pressure, force, and contact area in cases of knee arthroplasty compared to knees without arthroplasty.	0.574858045257921
We examined six leg specimens before and after knee arthroplasty.	0.40869793387331954
The modified Thiel fixation was used, and arthroplasty was the Genesis I without patellar implant (Fa.	0.4849057102773897
Smith & Nephew, Schenefeld).	0.1989615250793242
Contact measurements were performed with pressure-sensitive film (Fuji Prescale type "super low") in 45 °, 60 °, 90 °, and 120 ° knee flexion.	0.6556835216996197
The results were evaluated with special software, "Pressure Imaging and Analyzing System FPD-901 Series".	0.6680873874084647
The leg was exarticulated in the hip joint and the knee joint was opened from a suprapatellar approach.	0.6336517830892369
The film was placed at a defined area between the facies patellaris of the femur and facies articularis of the patella.	0.5867937912563301
Instantaneous pressure was measured during a time of 5-s pressure increase and a further 5 s. A force of 280 N was applied to the quadriceps muscle.	0.6923027026013586
Before knee arthroplasty, the contact area measured 154.3 mm2, the average pressure was 1.14 MPa, the force 182.13 N. After knee arthroplasty, the contact area was 119.94 mm2, the average pressure 1.522 MPa, the force 180.98 N. Following knee arthroplasty the contact area decreased significantly (P=0.015), and the average (P=0.0001) and maximum pressure (P=0.0003) increased significantly.	0.7169013941651646
The force did not change significantly (P=0.7642).	0.3321230639316474
The choice of the knee arthroplasty implant and approach to the knee joint should be considered in order to achieve an increased retropatellar contact area thus preventing smaller contact areas than before knee arthroplasty.	0.7387053408841994
The increased contact area could also prevent increasing retropatellar pressures after knee arthroplasty and further complications.	0.38582025395723335

Histological examination of 1660 biopsies (2 - 5 mm) of the synovial membrane of 317 patients were obtained by arthroscopic dissection; in 70% of all cases non-specific changes were revealed and in 30% specific changes.	0.881360933569951
The findings included different stages of proliferation of the superficial layer, uncharacteristic inflammatory reactions of the stratum synoviale and fibrosis of the stroma, vascular proliferation and pseudopolypoid thickening of the synovial membrane.	0.5870256704272682
The histomorphological findings can only be interpreted reliably and a pathogenetic classification obtained, e.g., detritus synovialitis, rheumatoid arthritis or post-traumatic changes, if the arthroscopic findings conclude an exact documentation of the biopsy site and the clinical findings.	0.5908259406346429
The aim of this study was to determine the impact of prolonged single lung ventilation and intrathoracic insufflation of CO2 during computer-enhanced totally endoscopic bypass grafting on biventricular myocardial function.	0.49541902802443044
Methods: Transesophageal echocardiography was performed intraoperatively in 20 patients undergoing the above mentioned operation.	0.59297101429918
At distinct time points during the intervention, a cine-loop of both ventricles was registered employing a mid short axis view.	0.4471909234552911
Simultaneously, oxygenation parameters as well as electrocardiographic data and intrathoracic CO2 pressure were taken.	0.47887490066140803
Wall motion analysis was done postoperatively.	0.4511510244551973
Results: With increasing duration of single lung ventilation, significant regional and global biventricular hypokinesia was detected.	0.5960094487468115
This was accompanied by a decrease in PaO2 and a marked increase in intrathoracic CO2 pressure.	0.5031555125939399
These alterations disappeared after weaning from extracorporeal circulation and reconstitution of double lung ventilation.	0.355604426012898
Conclusion: These results show that computer-enhanced coronary artery bypass grafting leads to significant alterations in intraoperative biventricular myocardial function.	0.5644236110803328
This can be due to either an impact on oxygenation during single lung ventilation or due to intrathoracic CO2 insufflation.	0.4487682628475995
However, in our group, these alteration showed only small clinical relevance.	0.8311817050913949

We have studied genetic linkage of FMS with HLA in multicase families, and found a rather weak linkage of FMS with HLA (P<0.029).	0.49624696469099816
Malformations of the urinary tract are one of the most common types of anomalies in the neonatal period.	0.642169343653116
Approximately 15-20% of all prenatally detected malformations  require acute postnatal imaging.	0.6557953334151787
Sonography is the primary imaging modality in the evaluation of nephro-urologic problems in infancy.	0.45800870034208246
Hydronephrosis represents the most common pathology, followed by multicystic-dysplastic kidney.	0.5119230060640161
Discussion: The result of the sonographic examination directs further imaging.	0.7323380981669716
An adequate diagnostic algorithm is decisive  for accurate diagnosis, for the appropriate therapeutic regimen and for the prognosis  of the patients.	0.8460166573438764
Calcification is one of the main causes of failure of porcine bioprosthetic heart valves, a problem which has not been satisfactorily solved to date.	0.627608241508588
Previous studies have shown that calcification is decreased in porcine heart valves that have undergone treatment for lipid extraction.	0.468735666346464
The relation between lipid distribution and calcification of seven new commercially available porcine bioprosthetic heart valves (St. Jude Medical, Bioimplant) is assessed by Sudan red III staining to show preexisting lipids.	0.4706428407537455
All porcine bioprosthetic valves contained lipids to different degrees.	0.2886513212234784
Five valves were subjected to the pulsatile accelerated calcification process for 4 weeks.	0.33802336454437293
Distribution and level of calcification were evaluated by radiography and compared to the Sudan red-stained fatty areas.	0.5630223672928707
Comparison of the calcifications detected by radiography and the macroscopically detected lipids showed a coincidence of 57-66%.	0.4630497905890277
Two porcine bioprosthetic valves were histologically prepared and stained with Hematoxylin and von Kossa's stain, respectively.	0.30144481436269693
By light microscopy, the von Kossa staining revealed microcalcifications and polarizing microscopic investigation showed birefractive substances in areas with lipid deposits.	0.4247695673881941
These preexisting substances in porcine valve tissue may play a determinative role in the calcification of the tissue.	0.48988921991680784
Substantial studies are necessary to further determine the role of preexisting lipids in calcification.	0.4785336041934306
Therapy for hip dysplasia and DDH by means of sonography.	0.4000654608357139
Numerous methods are available for treating "congenital" dysplasia of the hip (CDH).	0.6081980908474447
The important point seems to be the differentiation between dysplastic hip joints with and without displaced femoral heads.	0.6329056761840032
A historical review of the diagnosis of so-called "congenital dysplasia" and dislocation of the hip and different indications for therapeutic maneuvers is given.	0.7089944301290105
Generally, a three-step plan of treatment is recommended: dislocated heads must be reduced, after which retention is needed until the hip joint is stable.	0.7154577639882777
This is followed by maturation period, until the nonossified hyalin cartilagineous performed acetabular roof is ossified.	0.34128569768279854
All hip joints, regardless of age, can be assigned to one of these phases.	0.628990669692799
In all cases, measures are taken to prevent ischemic necrosis of the femoral head.	0.5385281220786604
To prevent the residual dysplasia of the acetabulum roof and femoral head necrosis, the reduction-retention position should be more than 90  ° flexion in the hip joint, but not more than 45-50  ° abduction.	0.8303664260573381
In each therapeutic phase there is a different biomechanical situation in the hip joint.	0.5283668112027041
The appropriate orthosis for treatment is chosen according to the particular biomechanical situation.	0.4411654274453826
Each sonographic type can be set up according to the our classification in the three-phase treatment system.	0.5889972110307012
In this way the adequate orthosis for treatment in each treatment-phase can be chosen.	0.6048868304538804
A case of a patient with malignant acanthosis nigricans in association with carcinoma of the lung is reported, documenting successful palliative treatment of the warty papillomatous thickening of the lips with electrocautery.	0.6888500493438313
Molecular atmospheric oxygen contains two unpaired electrons in the unreactive triplet state and thus has to be activated in order to react with other biological molecules in the singlet ground state.	0.3837863289758955
These processes of activation include very reactive intermediates.	0.25188150306407137
Therefore, aerobic cells must cope with - and to some extent also adapt to - oxidative stress provoked for example by infection or intoxication, where reactive intermediates of oxygen activation accumulate.	0.7144299389429491
Depending on the strength of these impacts, several symptoms indicate the deviation from normal, steady-state metabolism.	0.4917174019420477
Most of these visible or measurable symptoms are connected with oxygen activation where principally a transition from heterolytic reactions (two-electron transitions) to increased homolytic reactions (one-electron transitions) is observed.	0.5763248007464421
Homolytic reactions produce free radicals, which are generally counteracted by a parallel increase of intrinsic radical scavenging processes or by compounds administered with food, thus warranting metabolic control within certain limits.	0.5354507880808946
At advanced states of stress, control may be gradually lost and chaotic radical processes dominate.	0.3694961020028221
Finally, cellular decompartmentalizations yield apoptotic, lytic and/or necrotic processes.	0.3520126761285579
Every episode during this cascade is characterizable by the balance between pro- and antioxidative capacities.	0.45084666490048647
Antioxidants, which in many cases are free radical scavengers or quenchers of activated states, comprise a wealth of classes of organic molecules including phenolics, probably as the most prominent ones.	0.6382060739590761
In this article, mechanisms of oxygen activation and protection from oxidative damage are discussed.	0.4599227087491862
Furthermore, examples of antioxidative functions of a few important natural products are reported.	0.421076295256769
In a monocenter prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial the efficacy of homeopathic treatment was investigated on children with adenoid vegetations justifying an operation.	0.4160320241600475
Patients were treated with either homeopathic remedies such as Nux vomica D200, Okoubaka D3, Tuberculinum D200, Barium jodatum D4 and Barium jodatum D6 or with placebo.	0.4382821684212489
The duration of the study for each patient was 3 months.	0.9819259491950941
Examination of the ears using a microscope, rhinoscopy, stomatoscopy and pharyngoscopy, as well as tympanometry and audiometry were performed after 4, 8 and 12 weeks.	0.5513252675754479
Out of a total of 97 children studied between the ages of 4 to 10 years 82 could be analyzed.	0.5482234328345675
At the end of the study no operation was required in 70.7% of the placebo-treated children and in 78.1% of the children treated with homeopathic preparations.	0.7612494203173893
These results show no statistical significance.	0.5823759554884367
A treatment technique favorable for linacs with asymmetric jaws, which combined cranio-caudal matching fields with fields enclosing the whole target volume, is investigated with respect to field matching and sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk.	0.438589057412871
For a pelvic target volume rapidly varying in cranio-caudal direction a 5-field technique was planned with individually weighted and blocked fields.	0.4479437245456817
Three fields adjoining in cranio-caudal direction were completed by 2 fields enclosing the whole target volume.	0.30647804904047504
The matching line was measured and calculated with Helax TMS©.	0.43010703075533985
Furthermore a 4-field box and opposing fields were planned.	0.3466599289929066
The dose-volume histograms for target, bladder, intestine and soft tissue were exported.	0.5226574513303068
Normal tissue complication probability and tumor control probability, respectively, were calculated for all techniques.	0.5658407890953181
In the region of the matching line the summation of the measured normalized curves resulted in relative dose maxima of 6.0% (caudal) and 4.5% (cranial), respectively.	0.6495570334827688
For fields enclosing the whole target volume the dose maxima in the region of the matching line decreased to 2.0% (caudal) and 1.8% (cranial), respectively.	0.6479073842289327
For the dose profiles calculated with Helax TMS© no overdose was found.	0.30797615978358217
The 5-field technique with adjoining fields results in a better sparing of the organs at risk compared to the other techniques, whereas the tumor control remains the same.	0.7404427196925116
In specific cases a technique with cranio-caudal adjoining fields can be recommended with respect to sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk.	0.47135935585396876
Disseminated Langerhans-cell-histiocytosis (LCH) is most frequent in children at the age of 1-3 years, seldomly seen in adults and extremely rare in the elderly.	0.7247751587685197
The clinical course may be acute, subacute or chronic, progressive or stationary.	0.6660893365017371
Spontaneous remissions are possible, but rare.	0.5805740204057032
In elderly patients often the disease is at first limited to the skin before it becomes systemic.	0.719100074054038
Because of its central location, the elbow joint is considered the most important joint within the upper extremity from the viewpoint of function.	0.7866571630519601
Trauma to osseous and ligamentous structures of the proximal forearm confronts trauma surgeons and orthopedic specialists with numerous diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.	0.5387942780751707
Conditions following elbow trauma are often accompanied by chronic pain and diminished range of motion, leading to functional deficits of the entire arm.	0.5780488346723952
There is now practically no doubt that primary osteosynthesis, anatomical joint reconstruction and early onset of functional treatment are essential for a good final outcome.	0.6180901148194782
With our expanding knowledge of the anatomical and biomechanical condtions in the proximal lower arm in the last few decades the basic principles of therapy have also changed, and current standards of treatment for proximal forearm trauma are presented in this paper with reference to the relevant literature.	0.8026181771777519
The series of five patients with symptomatic isolated right ventricular outflow tract ectopy and no structural heart disease which were successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of the ectopic focus are reported in order to discuss radiofrequency ablation as an alternative treatment in patients with right ventricular outflow tract ectopy without ventricular tachycardia.	0.6253986635798288
Basic principles for treating patients with chronic pain are presented.	0.6551197577789067
They are the result of a longterm collaboration of collegues from different medical specialties in the pain outpatient unit of the University of Ulm.	0.556341145386374
In contrast to a variety of literature on chronic pain patients, these principles focus on the contribution of the therapists to the development of problems in treatment.	0.6800114222703135
Eight principles, considered especially important for the treatment of chronic pain patients are presented and discussed.	0.8210816597296191
We discuss this entity with the aid of a case report and the existing literature.	0.6493911587519975
The therapy of these tumors includes resection and possible adjuvant radiotherapy.	0.6183769339023114
Rhabdomyosarcomas are an exception, because they also show a good response to chemotherapy.	0.6697109647552248
14 human femurs were scanned by CAT and 3D reconstructed.	0.23552373073154606
In every specimen digital documentation of CCD and antetorsion (AT) angle was performed.	0.3945612961222318
With a special software package (Orthodoc) virtual preoperative planning for implantation of a cementless total hip alloplasty was undertaken.	0.5002013575300625
The specimens were randomised into two groups, one of which had manual and the other one robot implantation of the femoral component.	0.807386283170246
After implantation all specimens were evaluated again by CAT and CCT and AT angle were documented again.	0.37771616865309254
The preoperative CCD angle was 126.7  ° (SD = 4.0) in the manual group and 127.8  ° (SD = 4.3) in the robodoc group.	0.7562572941801128
Postoperatively the angle averaged 131.9  ° (SD = 0.8) in the manual group and 133.2  ° (SD = 1.9) in the robodoc group.	0.7714762773356926
Significant differences were found for the AT angle in both groups.	0.7016584698587255
The preoperative AT angle in the manual group was 31.3  ° (SD = 8.8), decreasing to 20.5  ° (SD = 9.5) after implantation.	0.7398957384990247
In the robodoc group this angle was 30.9  ° (SD = 8.0) before and 31.3  ° (SD = 8.7) after implantation.	0.7323246118757526
The difference between pre- and postoperative AT angle averaged 10.8  ° (SD = 6.4) in the manual group and only 0.4  ° (SD = 0.9) in the robodoc-group.	0.9015681837056174
Conclusion: With the technique used, preoperative planning in hip alloarthroplasty is much more accurate than with the conventional technique with plain X-ray.	0.7269382256942397
The virtual preoperative planning can be transferred to the intraoperative setting with high precision.	0.4743933297953315
These factors may lead to an increase in outcome quality.	0.5349518933542258
1000 drug-related fatalities that were examined in Hamburg from 1990-1996 by the Institute of Legal Medicine were analysed with respect to consumption of substitute drugs such as methadone.	0.5461507108998498
The incidence of methadone-related fatalities has increased in the last two years.	0.8709885074868715
The highest incidence was found in 1995 when methadone was detected in the blood of about 20% of all drug-related fatalities.	0.8822739471579587
Lethal monointoxications or combined intoxications with a dominant role of methadone were experienced rarely (about 1% of all drug-related fatalities).	0.6308545841648495
Of the persons who were enroled since 1990 in a methadone maintenance programme 2% have been registered as drug- related fatalities.	0.533874816617571
The mortality of street addicts without comparable medical help was about 10% in the same period.	0.6590152836944566
There is further need for improved methods of registration, documentation and forensic/sociological analysis of all drug-related fatalities for reliable conclusions concerning mortality rates of drug users who are enroled in methadone maintenance programmes.	0.49185860653201036
Pulmonary infections and tumors are a major cause of death in patients with AIDS.	0.6658427692266216
The combination of clinical, radiological, laboratory, and pathohistological data helps to narrow the spectrum of differential diagnoses or even allows a specific diagnosis in many patients.	0.5858874358820484
Nevertheless, an accurate diagnosis should be obtained as soon as possible during the clinical course of the illness to initiate treatment in time.	0.7140248373463819
Computed tomography (CT) has proven to provide promising results in the diagnosis of AIDS-related thoracic diseases.	0.6722067389731687
The aim of this paper was to demonstrate the diagnostic capacities of CT in the context of particular AIDS-related thoracic pathologies.	0.7139225081507705
Additional information on the spectrum of pathological agents and on differential diagnostic signs is summarized.	0.5220453839170546
This study was designed to provide information to which extend home-based nursing care services for the elderly take part in the care for older people with mental disorders.	0.7026126247403316
Also of interest was the involvement of clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system in the health care for the clients.	0.5181711520150926
A one day data collection in 29 nursing care services in two North Rhine-Westphalian regions could raise informations about 1,246 clients aged 60 years and over 1, 522 persons (41.8%) had a mental disorder, diagnosed by a nursing and/or medical professional.	0.5834040911159378
68% of the mental disordered clients had dementia or a demential disorder, 6% a functional psychoses, and 31% a neurotic, psychogenic disorder or substance abuse (small number of clients with two and more diagnoses).	0.6391806056852057
82% of clients with mental disorders had one or more additional somatic disease(s).	0.5325108772670863
These diseases were mostly the cause for the involvement of home-based nursing care service.	0.5272035703725786
Barely 8% of clients with mental disorders were placed from clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system into the nursing care services.	0.4751664846635353
Beside the home-based care, only 12% of mental disordered received clients outpatient psychiatric treatment.	0.6388575350483134
Systematic cooperation between the nursing care services and the system of (gero-) psychiatric treatemnt was a rare exception.	0.6547984437200384
Acute cerebral nerve paresis can be caused in many different ways.	0.4764994538339406
One of the more rare causes of paresis of one or more neural pathways is dissection of the internal carotid artery.	0.5832710642087853
Early diagnosis is important, even with atypical symptoms, since prompt anticoagulative therapy can hinder stroke from embolism due to the dissection.	0.6789284915829008
We report on two patients with Raeder's syndrome and Collet-Sicard syndrome resulting from dissection of the internal carotid artery.	0.5373841280432935
Besides the cranial and caudal nerves involved in our study, loss of function has also been reported with the sixth to eighth cranial nerves, so that any painful, sudden cranial nerve deficiency can indicate possible carotid dissection.	0.5457726558247726
In hematopoiesis, regulation and differentiation present a very complex functional network in which multiple factors of the microenvironment are involved.	0.4709890841858713
In addition to direct cell-to-cell contacts and the modifying influences of the intercellular matrix, soluble mediators play an important role in intercellular communication.	0.5432848355252102
Cytokines exert their effects by binding with specific receptors that transfer their signals to individual cells.	0.3339479266830459
A common structure shared by subunits of these receptors leads to competitive inhibition in binding the cytokines with different affinity.	0.3777469671030745
By this mechanism specificity is reduced, on the one hand; however, on the other the complexity of interactions in the bone marrow is enhanced.	0.7181781798325805
A flood of in vitro and in vivo studies have established the impact of various cytokines on single hematopoietic cell lineages and their application for clinical use.	0.4975267150714685
However, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the cellular origin of the cytokines.	0.625875180502735
According to the results of our studies elements of the erythro- and megakaryopoiesis are the source of cytokines like IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, and GM-CSF.	0.7668293646500297
Wound healing represents a dynamic process of increasing scientific interest, especially with the detection of the different growth factors.	0.7449626571238629
Economic aspects are also of importance in the investigation of substances used for wound healing.	0.6250371138082268
In Germany 25% of all patients (ca.	0.7620005124447244
1 million) with severe chronic venous insufficiency have crural ulcers.	0.6225933988243144
The influence of bacterial infection of crural ulcers is controversial.	0.4750876298072711
There is no doubt that the quantity of bacteria is of importance.	0.5165070183731334
Local antibiotic treatment is difficult, as most of the substances used are known to inhibit wound healing.	0.8029680728036022
In vivo and in vitro investigations showed, that chiniofon-containing antiseptic has a bacteriostatic function.	0.5754884457512184
Additionally it was shown, using cultures of fibroblasts, that chiniofon-containing antiseptic does not inhibit the growth of fibroblasts, whereas PVP-iodine solution, a widely used antiseptic, clearly reduces the growth of fibroblasts.	0.6689240474266354
The good clinical results in the treatment of acute and chronic radiation damage indicate that chiniofon-containing antiseptic may have antiflammatory activity.	0.6257327976694645
This article presents the heuristics concerning description of individual generative behavior.	0.359687590242785
The aim is to describe the development of the desire for children, the generative action and the dealing with generative decisions for intended and unintended childless women and men as well as parents.	0.5608540317942511
The main emphasis of the existing heuristics is placed on psychological questions.	0.3728415738497954
These heuristics explain patterns and influencing factors of generative action as well as positive and negative influencing factors of the coping process.	0.5466279974712666
It may be helpful to use heuristics which describe development of and coping with generative action as background information to ensure comprehensive consultation and therapy planning.	0.5073104843806535
Morbus Parkinson is a progressive degenerative disease of the human central, peripheral, and enteric nervous systems.	0.6373800983874792
In the course of the disease, not only the substantia nigra, but also extranigral components of the motor system, as well as numerous limbic system and autonomic centers undergo serious damage.	0.6872667120166847
Accordingly, Parkinson's disease is a multisystem disorder.	0.5977494789428902
Only specific types of projection neurons fall victim to it.	0.2476522166173152
The first manifestation of the pathological process which causes the disease are abnormalities of the neuronal cytoskeleton.	0.5967236197493012
Intracytoplasmic inclusions evolving in the form of Lewy bodies in perikarya and Lewy neurites in the neuronal processes result in premature cell death of the affected neurons.	0.40891862989408617
On the basis of this selective neuronal vulnerability, a categorization emerges of the pathological changes within the nervous system and corresponding functional impairments.	0.5658036243398773
Introduction: Children with "nursing bottle syndrome" and long standing teeth destructions and no treatment so far were examined for accompanying pathological changes in the bacterial flora of the mouth and alterations due to chronic inflammation of the oral mucosa and the alveolar jawbone.	0.7161656367430896
Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone marrow caused by both non-specific and specific agents.	0.7337262093947327
Non-specific endogenic osteomyelitis represents the most frequent form, followed by the specific form caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.	0.6583841282343958
Typically, the non-specific form occurs in children and young adults, and the sites most frequently affected are the distal and the proximal ends of the tibia and femur.	0.8806603204002247
In tuberculosis, osteomyelitis is predominantly located in the vertebral bodies.	0.563041147427741
In rare cases osteomyelitis can be caused by viruses, fungi or echinococcus.	0.40727911492692886
It may also occur as so-called acute endogenic osteomyelitis, such as plasmocellular osteomyelitis and Brodie's abscess.	0.48953422160641735
Histologically, dense infiltration of leucocytes, granulation tissue and bone sequesters can be seen.	0.5510029839390821
In tuberculosis granulomas with central necrosis, epithelioid cells and giant cells of Langhans type are characteristically found.	0.3415796635368763
Most forms of acute osteomyelitis can be successfully treated with antibiotics, leading to complete healing without complications.	0.5971829849223195
Only a few reported cases develop into a secondary, chronic form.	0.5954875383160313
Precision of osteodensitometric measurements using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) depends on various known factors, such as positioning, aortic calcification or vertebral fractures.	0.43866963893698113
The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of various diseases or bone density on the reproducibility of measurements in the lumbar spine and the proximal femur.	0.7735790569736325
Measurements in the LWS p.a., LWS lat.	0.41596716386910065
and at Ward's triangle were made in a total of 100 patients.	0.4841765112358499
The subjects were repositioned between measurements.	0.25285549038340643
In order to be able to determine the influence of various diseases, four groups of 25 patients each were formed: three with the diagnosis osteoarthrosis, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis and one control group.	0.6774656031416462
The mean percentual difference and coefficient of variation were calculated as the measure for reproducibility.	0.3888187269063832
Mean percentual differences of 0.18 to 2.6% were found in the four groups at the three measurements sites.	0.9256066653924662
After calculation of coefficient of variation, a value between 1.2 and 2.7% was found for LWS p.a., between 7.1 and 15.7% for LWS lat.	0.9271542429065944
and between 4.1 and 9.9% at Ward's triangle.	0.8160282989983767
It was also conspicuous that the difference in coefficient of variation in osteoporosis patients was nearly double that in the control group in all measured areas.	0.5917485221743964
Conclusion: Lateral lumbar spinal measurements using DEXA cannot presently be recommended.	0.30795887820986906

Diseases of the peripheral nervous system occur in up to 50% of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).	0.572988031984909
In early stages of the infection, Guillain-Barré syndrome or a spontaneously remitting mononeuropathy can occur.	0.4529776488204821
The most frequent occurrence is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy associated with HIV, which can only be treated symptomatically.	0.7145075320643914
The most important differential diagnosis is a drug-induced polyneuropathy under antiretroviral therapy with the nucleoside analogues DDI, DDC, or D4T.	0.6441377710488773
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is less common and can be treated with immunoglobulins or corticosteroids.	0.6069017261525634
Very rare are steroid-responsive neuropathies with necrotizing vasculitis or in diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS).	0.3316968571219492
In the AIDS stage, polyradiculitis can occur due to opportunistic infections - most often with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or M. tuberculosis - or polyradiculopathies due to lymphomatous meningiosis.	0.6365932241767335
Mononeuritis multiplex is rarely seen in disseminated CMV infection.	0.34255972605906815
Myopathies can occur in all stages of HIV infection; their frequency is about 1%.	0.6022313475855235
Primary polymyositis associated with HIV, which can be treated with corticosteroids or immunoglobulin, must be distinguished from myopathy induced by azidothymidine.	0.60292609168101
Other forms of myopathy are very rare.	0.44216851880839214
54 patients, who had been explored at the end of their treatment including a psychosomatic approach in a medical department of a general hospital, were interviewed again in their homes three months later.	0.7398634941265575
Contentment with treatment was high in the inpatient and outpatient setting, the ill felt only moderately stressed by their illnesses, showed an adaptive constellation of coping styles and were surprisingly well adapted.	0.5267612986415676
The comparison between the two measures showed a less favourable view of the patients three months after discharge from hospital at a quarter of the tested parameters, the variability was high in the scales, that were used.	0.804807884517284
Explanations for these results are discussed.	0.6512664743749061
At a long term perspective coping with illness may be improved especially by interventions of the family doctors.	0.5686797897446313
Health care costs have risen considerably since 1970 in all industrialized countries.	0.3996489034383253
This has several causes: changes in demographic structure, the large number of physicians, increased personnel needs resulting from generous vacation and special leave privileges, wage increases and - last but not least - medical progress.	0.5563537169984359
Advances in medical technology are often regarded as one of the main reasons for spiralling costs in health care.	0.5936029512297216
Careful analyses reveal, however, that the high costs of imaging services are due to conventional radiography rather than to high-technology (CT, MR) imaging.	0.6684027105896811
The legitimate demands for cost reduction have to be met with improved cost efficiency while optimal quality standards must also be maintained.	0.4323784865511174
Relevant suggestions, such as generally accepted examination strategies, should be realized with the help of the scientific societies.	0.47980694738139995
Background: Main features of the Coffin-Siris syndrome are mental retardation and absent or hypoplastic nails of the fifth fingers and toes.	0.400870872945256

Patient with extensive keratosis palmoplantaris maculosa seu papulosa (Davies-Colley) presented with multiple cutaneous horns.	0.36348747501975787
The clinical picture, the histology, the electro microscopic examination, the negative tumor screening and the viral classification in the tissue allowed the differentiation from other palmoplantar keratoses.	0.7394179205130013
The patient was treated successfully using a combination of acitretin with physical and chemical measures.	0.6359494499176378
Epidemiologic studies have shown that trace concentrations of inhalation anaesthetics polluting the air of operating theatres could have deleterious effects on the personnel's health.	0.42310285562780103
Nitrous oxide (N2O) oxidises vitamin B12 and thus decreases DNA production by inactivation of methionine synthase.	0.3159726121650706
Therefore, the United States and most European health authorities recommend threshold values to protect against potential health risks.	0.4591300991066832
These values range from 25 to 100 ppm, expressed as time-weighted averages (TWA).	0.41846218757921866
There is a lack of data concerning measurements of trace concentrations under defined conditions.	0.48649357955735406
The aim of this study was to quantify levels of N2O in a recovery room (RR) with an air conditioning system.	0.6059858541714664
The blood loss during the acute period after complex pelvic trauma is finally responsible for the high mortality associated with this specific type of injury.	0.7387028401765483
Several protocols have been published for optimized management, but up to now comparable data are not available as no exact definitions exist judging the severty of trauma and blood loss.	0.698527126944339
As part of a prospective study 19 patients after unstable pelvic injuries with unstable circulation underwent emergency stabilization by the pelvic C-clamp.	0.6106224637597574
Beside standard clinical parameter the initial hemoglobin value was converted into a "bloodvolume equivalent".	0.42819905621495424
18 of the 19 patients had an injury severety according to group III and IV of the Hannover Polytrauma Score (PTS).	0.5997812012380813
Concommitant abdominal injuries were seen in 12 cases (23 injuries), concommitant urological injuries in 12 cases (14 injuries).	0.64239773768511
In 13 cases the pelvis was the major source of bleeding in 9 cases an additional intraabdominal hemorrhage was observed.	0.5538843643192493
11 patients died due to sequelae of their injury, 8 patients survived.	0.5900607134802064
Although the initial blood loss was comparable both in the group of the deceased patients and the survivors, a 44% higher subsequent blood substitution (= 10 089 ml) was observed in the nonsurvivor group.	0.8467533129818978
In conclusion the data proofed that early control of hemorrhage is fundamental for the prognoses after complex pelvic trauma.	0.4283484354083066
The estimation of the blood loss may help in indicating agressive emergency procedures like emergency stabilisation, pelvic clamps, surgical exploration and tamponade.	0.6693841449093725
This calculation may be a basis for a more detailed analyses of this devastating injury and judging the benefit of different management protocols.	0.6142094886786962
In contrast to childhood intussusception, the clinical signs of intussusception in adults are nonspecific.	0.7589355152654408

In this case report on a retrograde jejunojejunal intussusception in a 61-year-old male, following removal of an intraoperatively placed intestinal tube for ileus therapy, the clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods and therapy for intussusception are described.	0.703545584699126
Sonography is not only the diagnostic tool of choice in childs, but also led to the correct diagnosis in this case.	0.976556953552624
In contrast to childhood intussusception, operative treatment is preferred in adults.	0.5713299189227073
The term "frontal lobe syndrome" comprises a variety of different clinical syndromes produced by focal lesions involving the prefrontal cortex.	0.42690875867746164
However, similar syndromes can be observed after lesions involving subcortical structures connected with the prefrontal cortex in neuronal networks.	0.5565837559506943
With respect to the different clinical pictures and underlying brain lesions, prefrontal lobe dysfunction may be divided into a disorganized type, caused by lesion of the dorsolateral prefrontal lobe and its connections, a disinhibited type that can be observed following lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex, and an apathetic type following lesions affecting the functional balance between the cingulum and the supplementary motor area.	0.6129150088063311
As intracerebral lesions are rarely limited to the brain regions described, in the majority of patients various degrees of behavioural dysfunction can be observed.	0.6800467741404261
The case reports of four patients illustrating the three major prefrontal syndroms following severe head injury (n=2) or cerebrovascular disease (n=2) are presented and diagnostic implications as well as possible treatment strategies are discussed.	0.7050681101408974
The measures taken in intensive care medicine are rated differently by the patients, their family, and personnel.	0.69296993996146
A lack of understanding for intensive care therapy can lead to a negative attitude towards intensive care medicine, which in turn makes an impression on public opinion, and disturbs the reputation of the co-workers in intensive care medicine.	0.6754865485228319
To form an objective view, we carried out a survey of 40 co-workers (11 physicians, 23 from the nursing staff, and 6 ancillary personnel) regarding the medical technology, the environment in the unit, general medical questions, and the extent of intensive care therapy.	0.8093557155654268
The length of employment in the intensive care unit ranged from 1-240 months (median 18 months), the ages ranged from 21 to 53 years (median 30 years).	0.7353874891004821
Of those questioned 73%  found intensive care medicine in its current form to be purposeful: 100% of the physicians and only 57% of the nursing staff were of this opinion.	0.7596237042794004
Only 9% of the physicians believed the equipment to be fear-inducing for the patients; in contrast, 61% of the nursing staff believed this to be true.	0.7652523778079543
The noise level was rated as very disturbing by 65% of the nursing staff and 45% of the physicians.	0.6728275954252294
Only 22% of the nursing staff believed that the patients felt comfortable and protected on the intensive care unit; 48% felt that they were unhappy or even miserable.	0.5925912701609577
Of the physicians 46% believed that the patients were comfortable.	0.7877207556329773
Of the nursing staff 100% were of the opinion that for the deceased patients, organ substitution therapy had continued too long.	0.666886369005942
On the other hand, only 45% of the residents shared this opinion.	0.5787304841039077
The medical staff rated the intensive care measures as purposeful, less disturbing for the patients and more effective than did the nursing staff.	0.7310224870806797
In many cases, the nursing staff as a group exhibited a contrary and negative opinion.	0.6774576642658595
This could possibly be caused by insecurity, lack of information and lack of successful experiences.	0.4582509637079208
Next to patient outcome, the competent explanation and information regarding the disease and prognosis and the recurrent communication within the intensive care team, with respect to diagnostic and therapeutic measures are the deciding factors in the opinion formation regarding intensive care medicine.	0.7129537435913204
In this pilot study 12 patients with moderate to severe atopic eczema were treated with 2 million IU interferon alpha 2a (Roferon A) three times weekly for 8 weeks and followed up for a further 10 weeks: 2 patients showed clear and 9 a slight to moderate reduction of their skin lesions; 1 patient got worse.	0.6694746157732198
Pruritus did not decrease and even increased in a few patients, and IgE levels showed no change during and after treatment.	0.7090353182844867
All patients noted mild, transient, flu-like symptoms.	0.38946875894397504
The efficacy of interferon alpha in the present therapeutic design for the treatment of atopic eczema must thus be classified as only moderate.	0.583835411385359
Shock secondary to sepsis is a serious common disease with a substantial mortality.	0.5201713558647005
Coagulation abnormalities, ranging from a rapid fulminant state of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) to a slight elevation in the level of fibrin(ogen) degradation products, are well recognized in patients with bacterial septicemia.	0.5897995119222103
Therefore, the inhibition of the activated coagulation is one of the first therapeutic steps.	0.7211832185441212
We investigated 30 intensive care patients with septic disease and comparable signs of abnomalities in coagulation at the beginning.	0.544907213174603
Fifteen patients were treated with 1.5-5 E/kg body weight (Low dose group), the others received 8-15 E/kg (high dose group).	0.8215691801796118
Our study demonstrated a significant stronger and faster decline of coagulation parameters - such as d-dimer, TAT and PTF 1 + 2 - in the High dose group without any bleeding disorder.	0.6813905898623703
Thus, we support in cases of coagulation disease except fulminant ones the high dose therapy with LMWH as shown above.	0.5712371124679838
Background: Laparoscopic techniques are currently used for curative resection of colorectal cancer although long-term results from controlled clinical trials are not available yet that prove laparoscopic procedures are adequate.	0.7228249060841683
Methods: All patients who underwent a curative resection of a colorectal tumor from 1995 to 1997 were included in a prospective cohort study to evaluate the short- and long-term results.	0.9035456436454525
Results: Laparoscopic colorectal resections were accomplished in 68 patients.	0.45988369749787683
In only 3 patients was an adenoma (stage 0) found, and 10 patients had multiple liver metastases at the time of palliative resection.	0.718861384899016
An oncological resection was performed in 55 patients.	0.5545175611008692
The average age was 62.8  +/-  14.6 years (29 female and 26 male patients).	0.8106656979789824
Eleven right colectomies, 1 left colectomy, 21 sigmoid resections, 16 proctosigmoidectomies and 6 abdominoperineal resections were carried out.	0.5191112644647277
Two patients (3.6 %) were lost during follow-up.	0.7944444036787466
The median follow-up was 27.1 months (range 9.1-45.1 months).	0.9491409551229469
No port-site metastases were found.	0.3064292083866381
Two patients who are still alive after sigmoid resection suffered from a recurrence.	0.6691596972921504
The first patient underwent only limited lymphadenectomy because of synchronous malignant lymphoma.	0.37958802491915383
The second patient developed bilateral lung metastases.	0.3858620858180661
Only one patient died during the follow-up period because of myocardial infarction.	0.7917668344942846
Conclusion: Although the follow-up is short, it seems that the recurrence rate is low.	0.8388706941243484
Controlled multicenter clinical trials are currently performed to evaluate whether laparoscopic surgery is really adequate to treat colorectal cancer.	0.6322754183274952
The authors report a tracheal rupture in a 34-year-old patient who was primarily intubated following generalised seizures and loss of consciousness (Rüsch endotracheal tube).	0.5728366658738677
Some hours later, she developed high ventilatory airway pressures and subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema were noted.	0.4389403760385909
Reintubation with a high-volume, low-pressure endotracheal tube was planned when it was noted that the ballon of the Rüsch tube was grossly overinflated.	0.65132165822268
Endotracheal tube cuff pressure was measured and found to be greater than 120 cm H2O (the maximum measurement possible with the manometer).	0.6313447479955543
The diagnosis of tracheal rupture was confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy.	0.5074790106271514
The patient immediately underwent a throacotomy and a 3-cm tear of the pars membranacea of the trachea was sutured with a dural patch.	0.5476035318407286
To maintain low airway pressures post-operatively, she remained sedated for 2 days and received a muscle relaxant to permit pressure-controlled ventilation.	0.5519720780853107
In this case, it can be concluded that excessive inflation of the endotracheal tube cuff resulted in the tracheal rupture.	0.6563679398307471
Other possible causes and results of tracheal rupture are discussed.	0.47596877731477477
Urinary tract infections are the most frequent nosocomial infections, accounting for about 40% of all nosocomial infections.	0.8479179305823495
In most cases these infections are associated with indwelling urinary catheters.	0.4742285654886916
The guideline from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, USA) for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections, as the most important evidence-based guideline worldwide, was published in 1981 and has not been updated so far.	0.6874368147748169
Evidence-based national guidelines are not available in Germany.	0.5652633853369861
We have, therefore, performed a literature search for randomized, controlled studies on the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (Medline, Cochrane Library, reference text books) published since 1981.	0.5235478191410398
Fifty studies meeting our inclusion criteria were identified.	0.21857145078361254
Substantial new findings have been published on alternatives to urethral catheters and new catheter materials.	0.5052944325767098
Based upon the CDC guideline, whose principles are still valid, updated guidelines for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections have been developed by the National Reference Center for Hospital Hygiene.	0.6188119215914698
Chronic hypoperfusion of the hypogastric arteries due to aortoiliac surgery leads to a complex of symptoms well known as Lerich's syndome.	0.43641290473269756
In contrast, acute ischemia of the pelvic arterial tree leads to lethal complications [2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13].	0.7832133619890238
Acute interruption of the hypogastric perfusion mainly occurs after aortoiliac surgery or after selective transcatheter embolisation of the internal iliac artery for control of pelvic bleeding [1, 8].	0.578384586744205
Several complications may occur after total occlusion: urinary bladder necrosis [6], left colon ischemia, spinal cord ischemia [10], nerve palsy, necrosis of the rectum and gluteal musculature [2, 11-13].	0.6022560277115226
Despite adequate therapy, mortality is over 70% [2].	0.7823054881447495
We report the case of a 66-year-old patient who survived after acute occlusion of the iliac arteries with gluteal necrosis following replacement of the infrarenal aorta with an aortobiiliacal graft.	0.5764792384969964
As demonstrated in 44 allogeneic sibling (34 HLA identical, 10 HLA mismatched at 1-3 loci) and 6 unrelated (1 HLA-identical, 5 mismatched at 1-3 loci) cord blood (CB) transplantations CB has been shown to be a rich source of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.	0.6817942252588097
Therefore, a scientific pilot project in order to evaluate HLA class I and II typed cord blood samples for unrelated transplantation was initiated.	0.5834705371182062
Hitherto 372 CB samples: mean volume 79 +/-  5x108, were collected from the umbilical cord vein immediately after vaginal full term delivery (n=302) or ceasarean section (n=70) and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen.	0.5580013425246948
Methods for HLA-typing by serology for HLA-class I and II from minimal cell amounts were adjusted that only 1.5 ml of the whole CB was needed for both the HLA-class I and II typing by serology (1 ml) and DNA-typing for HLA-class II (0.5 ml).	0.7490017783790038
Only 3.5 additional ml of the CB were required for the AB0 typing, control of sterility, determination of progenitor cells by colony forming assays and CD34 and the analysis of contaminating maternal cells by simultaneous immunophenotypic and genotypic analysis of interphase cells and the PCR using sequence-specific priming (PCR-SSP) for the non-inherited maternal allel.	0.5239664987204703
Mother'sera have been tested for HBsAg, anti-HCV, -HAV, -HIV-1-2, -EBV, -VCA, -HTLVI-II, -CMV, Toxoplasmosis and Syphilis.	0.9853216454576236
Nonepithelial malignant tumors of the pancreas are extremely rare neoplasms with a frequency of ~0,6%.	0.5878780484918927
They are always explored because of a suspected diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma.	0.6573620879820581
Amongst the more than 600 primary pancreatic neoplasms in our pancreatic tumor archive only 5 neoplasms were of nonepithelial origin (one was a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor [MPNST], one a leiomyosarcoma, one a malignant mesothelioma, and two were peripheral neuroectodermal tumors [PNET].	0.6072709148362768
The differential diagnosis includes secondary infiltration of the pancreas by mesenchymal tumors of the retroperitoneum, undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma and, especially in the case of PNET, malignant lymphoma.	0.7271884931411093
Preoperative chemotherapy and down-staging can improve the operability and  prognosis, especially in PNET.	0.585718217991217
In patients with renal or hepatic failure, the pharmacokinetics of opioids may be affected in several ways, leading to the necessity to correct the dose.	0.6721334288737612
The liver is the major site for biotransformation of most opioids.	0.5096595530407487
The major metabolic pathway is oxidation.	0.24078476876934993
Exceptions to this are morphine and buprenorphine, which undergo primarily glucuronidation, and remifentanil which is cleared by esther hydrolysis.	0.5413003242240824
The hydrophilic metabolites are predominantly excreted by the kidneys and may accumulate in patients with renal insufficiency.	0.4797221848799295
Some metabolites such as morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) or normeperidine are active opioid agonists.	0.46104608801766467
With high concentrations they may cause narcotic effects or respiratory depression.	0.3823549957585519
In addition, special risks are known for normepridine that has been shown to exert neurotoxic effects with the risk of seizures.	0.5518929824761385
Few cases of respiratory depression following the administration of codeine, dihydrocodeine and tramdol have been reported.	0.4898961117352358
The elimination half-life of these drugs was prolonged.	0.6260833297830298
Lastly, the disposition of methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, sufentanyl and remifentanil appears to be unaffected in renal failure.	0.49173795981851076
Backgrounds: Aim of this study was to validate a modification of adults' 13C-urea breath test for children in diagnosis of an infection with Helicobacter pylori.	0.5436018971870142
Methods: In 30 asymptomatic children results of the breath test were compared with results of an ELISA test specific for Helicobacter pylori.	0.6887044960448546
In 10 symptomatic children the breath test result was compared with histological results of gastric mucosa.	0.5400823636412801
Cold orange juice was tested by ultrasonic assessment to be suitable as a test meal.	0.5203710925522153
Results: With the serological or histological result as reference method, the cut-off value for children (delta value = 5 permil) has shown a sensitivity/specificity of 70 %/95 % or 100 %/100 % respectively.	0.8020480126401484
Cold orange juice meets the criteria of a test meal by inhibiting the gastric emptying for the duration of the breath test significantly.	0.5409488990348889
30 minutes after 13C-urea ingestion has been the optimal point of time for the second breath sample collection.	0.5350593064616445
Conclusion: Our modification of the 13C-urea breath test for children is suitable to prove an Helicobacter pylori infection.	0.47736288396964577
This review summarizes some aspects of German pediatrics as it developed after world war II.	0.5190144983732532
Having lost its touch with international pediatrics regained its high standard during the late forties and fifties and now develops in concordance with the changing needs and the advances of pediatrics in a highly industialoized nation.	0.3575528053918963
As in other countries, the practice and structure of pediatrics have been influenced by changes in social attidudes and expectations, and by economic restrictions.	0.6252219112783528
National specifics are the high number of practicing pediatric population and emphasis on a highly structured and formalized preventive care program under a public health plan.	0.37428085990404664
The need for critical evaluation of this program is emphasized as is the need for better communication among subspecialties.	0.5220648207457739
Aim of this study was to isolate T lymphocytes from atheromatous plaques and to determine they respond to Chlamydia antigens.	0.46209384420851696
In recent years, mumps orchitis has become a rarely reported disease.	0.5893069662715098
However, since October 1994 a clear increase in the incidence of this disease has been observed.	0.7936324169115849
At four hospitals in the Saarland, Germany, 45 cases of mumps orchitis in adolescents and adults were diagnosed in this period.	0.5609187066407736
In addition to the case history and clinical findings, the diagnosis was confirmed by an increased IgM titer.	0.9313669107656398
None of the patients had been previously vaccinated.	1.0676592486426417
The main reason for this was a lack of parental knowledge of the necessity for this vaccination, one which has almost no side effects.	0.6344004108965199
The goal of this study is to describe the disease, present our own results, and indicate the need for vaccination.	0.7669447338629044
In addition to providing information, a further aim of the study is to increase the motivation of adolescents and adults for vaccination.	0.8934264800345857
Although many treatments for mumps have been published in recent years, the most successful therapy is still prophylactic vaccination.	0.7725383611381855
Neurofibromas, café au lait macules and freckles in the axillary or inguinal regions are common manifestations of von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (NF-1).	0.37249820503008335
Less known is the simultaneous appearance of dermal melanocytic naevi.	0.3257909720104543
We describe the case of a 21-year-old Vietnamese woman who showed generalized, multiple neurofibromas, a solitary plexiform neurofibroma in the left gluteal region and Lisch nodules.	0.6427922525173939
In addition, there were several large grey-blue macules histologically characterized by fusiform pigment-bearing cells in the dermis, which we diagnosed as persistent aberrant mongolian spots.	0.627366985079357
In the right zygomatic region she presented a grey-blue, hair-bearing macule, which we saw as a variant of Ota's naevus.	0.597210976007018
A genetic background for this coincidence of a systemic with a local phakomatosis can be supposed, as both Schwann's cells and melanocytes are derived from the neural crest.	0.5345538300157145
Such pathologic rearrangement in the embryogenesis of the cellular elements could be important for the pathogenesis of NF-1 and dermal melanocytic nevi.	0.567214835255959
Infectious agents may directly or indirectly (through the response of the host's immune system) modulate the growth of vascular cells.	0.5049928189161803
Local and/or systemic increase of cytokines could influence the extent of (re-)stenosis in the vascular tree.	0.6793273074488383
Further studies in this field may identify patients at a high risk for atherogenesis and restenosis.	0.6804845149035688
Their results should be helpful in treating restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions.	0.4172291030611929
Besides other reasons, cost containments mandate the rational use of preoperative screening tests which should be adapted to the risk of the individual patient.	0.6657559461462236
Since the perioperative cardiac risk increases with age, elderly patients in particular require a thorough evaluation of their perioperative risk.	0.5088798315679758
Routine ECG, however, is not indicated in patients under 45 years of age who do not present with signs or history of preexisting cardiac diseases but should be performed on a routine basis in all patients over 45 years of age.	0.684080902791375
The validity of an ergometer test as a preoperative indicator of myocardial ischemia is limited due to a high incidence of false negative results.	0.5811629370320839
By preoperative routine chest radiography previously unknown findings are only detected in a small number of patients; thus, in patients of ASA-risk groups I-II younger than 74 years of age routine chest-x-ray cannot be justified.	0.7168461490648355
In patients whose perioperative cardiac risk as assessed clinically and by ECG is ambiguous, dipyridamole-thallium-myocardial scintigraphy (DTMS) and dobutamine-stress-echocardiography may contribute valuable information regarding the prediction of perioperative adverse cardiac events.	0.5178892299951409
In that respect, dobutamine-stress-echocardiography appears to be superior to DTMS.	0.41530067772069096
The laboratory tests required in patients of different ASA-risk groups and according to their age are presented in an overview.	0.666706043987591
Generalized muscle weakness in critically ill patients can result in prolonged periods of artificial ventilation and longer stays in the intensive care unit.	0.44055020306944553
Both neuropathic (critical illness polyneuropathy) and myopathic (critical illness myopathy) abnormalities seem to play an important role for this prolonged weakness.	0.5178372521588351
This article reviews its complex differential diagnosis with special emphasis on the current understanding of the neuromuscular syndromes.	0.6833439294501716
An efficient diagnostic plan is necessary for the exclusion of other curable causes of prolonged muscle weakness even in the presence of polyneuromyopathic changes.	0.5165558549475551
Psychological support of the patient and prophylaxis of secondary complications of prolonged immobilization are crucial when specific therapy is not possible.	0.7401984240792266
Modern ultrasonic diagnostic instruments with high resolution and color Doppler sonography allow the obstetrician to describe pathological findings very precisely and at an early stage of pregnancy.	0.4950892909209525
The use of high-resolution ultrasound makes it possible to detect heart malformations already between the 8th and 10th week of gestation.	0.5462620143087599
This development has essentially changed the clinical requirements on fetal autopsy which in its traditional way no longer meets the increased demands.	0.3894076159344358
Unless the pathologists faces this challenge the importance of fetal autopsy will diminish.	0.3330733936349058
Modern image databases and communication techniques allow the pathologist to have direct access to text and images of pre-findings by other clinics.	0.3800853329893927
Great importance, however, must be attached to the interdisciplinary cooperation with obstetricians and geneticists.	0.42392895512284445
We report on routine fetal autopsy by using an interdisciplinary database an the Charité.	0.4990688769295303
Infrainguinal arterial reconstruction for intermittent claudication has been discouraged because of fear of bypass graft failure, significant perioperative complications, and limb loss.	0.5325716824126662
This may be worse than the natural history of the disease.	0.6122976343816157
In our study, we retrospectively evaluated all infrainguinal bypass procedures performed in the past 10 years.	0.7862428058589392
Radiosurgery represents a minimally invasive radiologic method for the treatment of intracranial tumours and arteriovenous malformations.	0.5072102475487148
In 1994 the radiosurgical device 'Leksell Gamma Knife' (LGK) was installed in a dedicated logistic environment for outpatient treatments.	0.4309527048119335
High quality requirements have to be met for radiosurgery.	0.4876713407228556
The target point accuracy taking into account the whole system was shown to be reliably below 0.5 mm whereas the spatial therapeutic resolution was 0.035 cm3.	0.6563717830786098
Quality parameters of the dose plan were evaluated for the first 500 consecutive treatments.	0.6911263886342155
These values and examples of dose plans were used to emphasize the advantages of the treatment principle with multiple isocenters.	0.7124970747844659
An analysis of data in the literature revealed that there is no uniform standard of treatment available in radiosurgery.	0.831152946395226
A highly significant correlation between a risk prediction model for the stereotactic linear accelerator on the one hand and a different model for the LGK on the other could be shown.	0.6924150680033674
This result could be helpful in order to proceed towards a more uniform treatment standard in radiosurgery and to improve overall treatment results.	0.4769537609751477
Even if Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis has not found the true aetiology of puerperal fever - bacteria were identified as pathogens only after his observations - he was the first to consequently use epidemiological methods in order to elucidate connections and influencing factors in the spread of nosocomial infections, to draw the right conclusions from his observations on the transmission of childbed fever and to draw the right consequences by implementing preventive measures, especially the hand disinfection.	0.6475912026685505
He has correctly realized that human beings suffering from purulent or putride lesions or having even died from them can act as infectious sources as can hands of health-care personnel act as vehicles.	0.38213748694696226
As a characteristic feature of nosocomial infection, he noticed that generally only the weakend organism of the patient is involved as an infection target.	0.7204417773393771
The impact of his doctrine not only made him "saviour of the mothers" but also justifies to regard him as "father of the obstetric infection prevention" if not even as the founder of the modern science-based hospital hygiene.	0.5272155583963396
In this paper we present a method for measuring the wear of the polyethylene inlay in knee joint endoprostheses from standard X-ray images.	0.6918331116388442
Our approach is to estimate the spatial position of the tibial and femoral components of the prostheses from their contours in the X-ray image.	0.6586124914532606
When we know the exact shape of these two components, we can calculate the minimal spatial distance between them which approximates the remaining thickness of the inlay.	0.6555469891074055
First results show that this approach might provide sufficient accuracy for the given task.	0.5327313038283445
Most children with borreliosis show cutaneous symptoms following a tick bite infected with Borrelia Burgdorferi.	0.3427254038381443
Erythema migrans is a classical skin lesion of early borreliosis characterized by a centrifugally expanding erythema at the site of the prior tick bite.	0.43542491710535236
After hematological spreading of the vector multiple erythemata migrantia occur with a very low incidence in Europe as described in the case of a 2 1/2 years old infant who was successfully treated with oral cephalosporine.	0.6527963943961038
One year follow-up revealed no further manifestations of borreliosis.	0.4354863331102002
This means an excellent prognosis for those children with borreliosis who are treated promptly.	0.5076128654267762
Background: We compared the standard suprathreshhold strategy to the so-called threshhold splitting strategy with 5 and 2 dB steps.	0.5900190410945211
The aim of the study was to establish whether the threshhold splitting strategy had advantages over the suprathreshhold strategy that has been used to date.	0.7105998045638106
Resection specimens of 14 patients with small cell bronchial carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were processed histologically and graded according to a three-step regression grading system: grade I, no or only slight tumor regression; grade II, incomplete tumor regression; grade III, complete tumor regression without vital tumor tissue.	0.6189975216282119
In five patients with either no vital tumor tissue or only small tumor remnants in the resection samples, a typical sequence of central fresh tumor necrosis, foam cell rim, vascular granulation tissue and peripheral scar formation was seen.	0.6107423240268134
This morphological finding may be interpreted as a characteristic, but unspecific parameter of good response to preoperative chemotherapy.	0.5906995668440731
The presence of vital tumor rims surrounding the capillary bed with intermingled necrotic foci, however, argues in favor of spontaneous tumor regression, which is commonly observed in small cell lung cancer.	0.5233090843895747
Background: The term "Castleman's diseas" (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) comprises a heterogeneous clinicopathologic entity among lymphoproliferative disorders.	0.45735490495364906
In accordance with the German law on care for helpless persons, an observer rating scale has been developed to allow a staging of need of care.	0.700920315409678
Construction of the scale, item descriptions, definitions, algorithms for sum score and inter-rater reliability data are reported.	0.39733780629851423
The scale can reliably measure the need of care, quality of care, and who is the care provider.	0.7075907272151912
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) improves the success of trabeculectomy.	0.6290388441295575
Since in vitro studies showed a prolonged effect of 36 days of growth inhibition with a single dose of 5-FU, 5-FU is applied intraoperatively.	0.7899033455508387
To evaluate the effect of intraoperatively applied 5-FU, we compared 13 (low-risk) patients with intraoperative application of 5-FU to a control group matched by age, diagnosis, sex and stage of glaucoma.	0.8618649479850721
Postoperatively on day 4 the IOP was significant lower (4.8 mmHg) in the 5-FU-group in comparison to the untreated group (P=0.005; power 0.80).	0.7110625044448259
After 1 week the difference decreased to 2 mmHg and was not significant any more (P=0.16).	0.5668810685786151
After 1 week a lower mean intraocular pressure of 2 mmHg was found with a P-value of 0.16.	0.5727718322899363
It may be that these results are not just due to an antiproliferative mechanism; a direct toxic effect of 5-FU should be considered.	0.7848807755839865
5-FU side effects such as corneal complications and inflammatory reaction were not increased in the 5-FU group.	0.6264651752701001
However, one case of persistent hypotony was seen in the 5-FU group.	0.8701337407544459
This study found intraoperative use of 5-FU to be a safe procedure with a pronounced capacity to lower IOP in the direct postoperative phase.	0.6863103385886639
However, this effect may not be based on an antiproliferative effect alone, but might be of toxic origin.	0.8858621042539443
A postoperative bile fistula is a rare but severe complication after biliary surgery.	0.676069652782492
Clinical signs, laboratory findings, ultrasound and ERC lead to diagnosis.	0.5400062720117454
We report on 40 cases with postoperative bile leakage after cholecystectomy treated by a nasobiliary tube.	0.5661444131730503
In all patients the fistula healed within 7 days after placement of the tube.	0.7222181650043851
Two patients needed operative treatment of a subhepatic abscess, and in 2 patients drainage of a bilioma was performed.	0.8768094736218356
In 2 cases with biliary peritonitis, a step-by-step lavage was necessary.	0.620151812115574
The nasobiliary tube for postoperative bile fistula offers regular radiological control and reduces the necessity of operative reintervention in the biliary tract.	0.4512369844253481
Description of a 27 years old patient with chronic renal failure due to diabetes, which requires dialysis, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, who developed fulminant systemic calciphylaxis after successful renal transplantation.	0.7281693757014266
Characteristic of this syndrome, there occured soft tissue calcification, mediacalcinosis of the small and medium-sized arteries and ischemic skin necrosis.	0.6353498227544515
The pathogenesis is not completely clear, but challenging agents like corticosteroids or immunsuppressants, in a sensitized organism (at hypercalcemia or elevated parathormon) could lead to calcium deposits.	0.7173909498745199
These are showing a particular affinity for elastic tissue.	0.3116641155371612
Lungs, stomach, kidneys, cutis, heart and vascular system are most frequently involved.	0.5494527114364374
Treatment is primarily supportive; an early parathyroidectomy seems to have the best prognosis.	0.6457594729738769
Contact urticaria and anaphylactic reactions to latex-containing rubber products are being recognized with increasing frequency in all kinds of medical disciplines.	0.5294411713902761
Recently a number of reports have been published describing anaphylactic reactions to food items in patients with latex allergy.	0.6323433360193811
The cases of three patients who developed anaphylactic reactions to both latex and food items are presented, and the importance of the association of latex and cross-reactivity with food items is stressed.	0.7320543509441533
The food items that led to anaphylactic reactions were banana and avocado; banana, avocado and buckwheat; and banana, avocado and tomato.	0.3612413940880053
The cross-reactivity of latex to buckwheat and tomato has not been reported before.	0.4924324530141654
The branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR syndrome) is characterized by auricular abnormalities, lateral cervical fistulas and preauricular tags.	0.5012041710481947
The hearing impairment may be a conductive, a sensorineural or a mixed hearing loss.	0.5857768798290904
The renal disease is oligomeganephronia, a bilateral, congenital renal abnormality with reduced numbers of nephrons.	0.5490886431164321

The CO2 laser myringotomy is a current low-pain procedure for middle-ear ventilation for secretory otitis media (SOM) that can be performed under topical anesthesia, even in children.	0.6664574978198339
The duration of middle-ear ventilation is essentially determined by the size of the perforation created.	0.6478759667049075
Perforations with a diameter greater than 2 mm ventilate the tympanic cavity for approximately 3 weeks, thus avoiding tympanic ventilation tubes.	0.6100327920288103
To date, the CO2 laser beam can only be reliably applied to the tympanic membrane via a micromanipulator system coupled to an ear microscope.	0.5726496213325992
The CO2 laser otoscope is a new application system that markedly reduces the technical complexity of surgery and improves the mobility and availability of the system.	0.6490064274130249
The incorporation of a small inexpen-sive CO2 laser in the otoscope represents a significant development in SOM therapy.	0.4124212595380573
Abstract   Amifostine is an organic thiophsophate which protecvts normal cells from the effects of chemotherapy with reduced nadir and duration of cyclophosphmamid induced neutropenia, reduced cisplatin derived renal and neurological complications being described.	0.4451250883609991
However, no data are available for urological malignancies treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.	0.674451881487756
Aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of pretreatment with amifostine in terms of prevention of renal, hematopoetic and neurologic toxicity.	0.5374661580081141
17 patients (mean age: 62.6 [45-74]) with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder received inductive or adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy (1-6 cycles) with a cisplatin dose of 70 mg/m2.	0.8079550558716369
Amifostine (740-910 mg/m2) was administered intravenously 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy.	0.5575214684410258
For all patients creatinine clearance, serum creatinine and electrolytes including magnesium, and blood cell count were determined prior to and after each cycle.	0.6671601335532554
A group of 12 patients (mean age: 61.9 [51-67]) did undergo MVEC chemotherapy (1-4 cycles) without receiving amifostine and served as control group.	0.8153799145031558
Amifostine was well tolerated and only 1 patient suffered from gastrointestinal discomfort, blood pressure remained unchanged in all patients.	0.7245480356146635
Amifostine prevented a significant reduction of creatinine clearance even in the 2 patients with known renal insufficiency: mean creatinine clearance was 125  +/-  20 ml/min prior to and 115  +/-  25 ml/min after chemotherapy.	0.7063923296738158
In the control group, however, creatinine clearance dropped from 121  +/-  30 ml/min to 85  +/-  20 ml/min after completion of MVEC chemotherapy.	0.6331802180056024
Serum creatinine levels did not increase significantly (1.1 mg/dl prior to and 1.2 mg/dl after chemotherapy), magnesium levels did not decrease significantly and normalized at the end of chemotherapy.	0.8491844031342143
Significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed in 29 % and 12 % of the patients in the amifostine group and in 67 % and 33 % of the patients in the control group.	0.9868281926261161
Amifostine was shown to have a protective effect against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in the elderly patient undergoing systemic chemotherapy.	0.6701560952238339
Based on our data amifostine should be applied in the supportive management to prevent chemotherapy induced complications.	0.594460146272811
The diagnosis of leptomeningeal dissemination of chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) by conventional cytology is unreliable because cytomorphologic criteria of malignancy are often lacking.	0.5215842302693018
Immunophenotyping of leukocyte differentiation antigens may also be of limited diagnostic value due to the small  number of cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples.	0.5554991422972464
Molecular methods may support the specific diagnosis of leptomeningeal infiltration of CLL.	0.4502265352137155
We present an 54 old patient who was diagnosed with CLL five years ago.	0.6055704639867375
Despite clinical signs of leptomeningeal  involvement neither magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nor conventional CSF analysis were suggestive of lymphomatous meningitis.	0.39829409630777846
Using PCR we selectively amplified the highly variable and clone-specific CDR3 region of the locus encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) in DNA obtained from both CSF and peripheral blood cells.	0.491362409903368
Analysis of PCR products by high resolution gel electrophoresis revealed a single DNA fragment respectively indicating the presence of a  monoclonal cell population in both  compartments.	0.46731510088227773
DNA sequence analysis of the amplified CDR3 segments confirmed the clonal identity of cells and the leptomeningeal dissemination of CLL.	0.4653037480415626
In the orthopedic department of the University Hospital Homburg/Saar, we use since 1993 a computer-based system for clinics organisation and documentation of operations.	0.6893860670958083
Hardware consists of DOS/Windows PC's in a Novell-network.	0.24828727364326658
Our software is a combination of datbase-system for managing patient-data and a special coding program for ICD and IKPM-digits.	0.41094792966751564
Our experience shows that computer assisted clinic-management is an effective tool to help the surgeon in planning and documentation.	0.5636829824250024
Until now, we used the system for 31 500 patients and 8500 operations.	0.6630168430394952

In one third of the little girls coming to the outpatient clinic for pediatric gynecology, a vulvovaginitis can be diagnosed.	0.6551794761884844
Etiologic factors are poor perineal hygiene, foreign bodies in the vagina and respiratory or skin infections.	0.4653222566500164
The microbiologic investigation often reveals staphylococci, streptococci, E. coli, and in case of chronical-recurrent discharge also B. fragilis and peptostreptococci.	0.6094740588698955
The symptoms are itching, burning, dysuria, discharge and rubor of the vulva.	0.45874497919278423
A systemic application of antibiotics is not necessary, a local treatment with antibiotic solutions is contraindicated and the usual vaginal suppositories are unsuitable for girls.	0.6086412441172657
A desinfection often irritates the vulvovaginal region of little girls so that for years we use estriol ointment only which is tolerated.	0.3236640152874919
Excellently, a single-dose application being sufficient; burning, itching and discharge disappear and the vaginal epithelium gets more resistant because of the estrogen influence, so that the healing process is accelerated.	0.5912776615911435
The author gives a short overview of the psychodynamic and psychoanalytic basics of psychotherapy with guided affective imagery.	0.48271911339190615

The situation of psychiatric patients in the Ukraine is determined by the financial and economic difficulties of this country.	0.6646121735573407
In the larger cities, so-called polyclinics take care of ambulant psychiatric patients.	0.45983864599035024
However, no other social psychiatric institutions exist.	0.5896692592907937
Here, the modalities of hospital psychiatric treatment are discussed using the psychiatric hospitals in Kiev and Shitomir as examples.	0.5412718811775571
Undertreatment is also a problem, because only a few psychopharmacological drugs are produced in the Ukraine.	0.7287013371470547

Improving the availability of psychopharmacological drugs and the establishment of a social psychiatric network are major aims for psychiatrists working in Ukraine.	0.4001382338784189
Renal lesions are frequently encountered in blunt pediatric abdominal trauma.	0.3169891249579285
In this retrospective study, we analyzed the incidence of renal trauma in these trauma patients to determine which diagnostic and therapeutic approaches were most predictive.	0.7286715861274313
From 1976 to 1996, 308 children sustaining blunt abdominal trauma were admitted to our department.	0.44388724625751846
Patients were evaluated using abdominal paracentesis, ultrasonography, and urinary analysis.	0.624004448592377
In specific cases, IV urography, CT scan, and/or angiography were applied.	0.6703319889790151
We used the Organ Injury Scale (OIS) for classification of renal trauma into five grades.	0.5918856902069192
The result of a B-scan ultrasound examination is strongly dependent on the type of the used B-system, the chosen system parameters and the experience and critical analysis of the clinical investigator.	0.7406241736510836
The estimation of quantitative acoustic parameters, independent of the type of the used B-system, is one way to overcome the subjective nature and the problems of the interpretation of B-scan images.	0.7612980349416734
Results of a longitudinal study about the transition to retirement are presented.	0.5518699336037493
329 persons were interviewed three times (quantitative study) and 20 persons conducted a semi-structured diary (qualitative study), covering in both groups a two-year period (from half a year before retirement to one and a half years after retirement).	0.6012765338533989
They were asked about their subjective well-being (happiness, joy, satisfaction, stresses), their life situation and their personal, social and material resources.	0.529572775904448
The results show that the transition to retirement brings with it gains (leisure time) and losses (financial, social status), but overall maintains a high level of well-being.	0.6536596177359539
Specific analyses point out inter-individual differences, risk factors and resources, like a high level of trait well-being, health, social networks and an optimistic outlook.	0.6126070525780701
The diary analyses lead to specifications, more detailed process analyses and hypotheses about cohort effects.	0.4436612582780415
Consequences for an adequate preparation for retirement are discussed.	0.34057941844936607
Intraoperative complications can be divided into three categories on the basis of the time of their occurrence: Group I - Problems associated with access; group II: introduction of the endovascular stent (a: release of the main segment, b: anchoring the second limb); and group III: incidence of primary endoleaks.	0.7375365172150873
Interferon alpha and gamma have been used to treat several hepatic, hematological and oncological diseases for years.	0.534642168051671
Recently, interferon beta has been introduced as a therapeutic agent in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.	0.5959378010283544
A 41-year-old female patient with multiple sclerosis developed non-tender, palm-sized, cutaneous-subcutaneous, reddish infiltrates at the injection sites on her thighs after 8 weeks of treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta injections.	0.5623072222329496
Histopathology revealed a perivascular lymphoid infiltrate of the dermis and a subtle lobular lymphoid infiltrate of the subcutis.	0.46935738556541606
Interferon beta therapy was discontinued for 4 weeks.	0.43313047860238485
With topical corticosteroids, the skin lesions resolved.	0.8226734061196932
When subcutaneous injections were resumed at a reduced dose, only erythema around injection sites developed without induration or pain.	0.4465843686398756
Slight erythema and swelling at interferon beta injection site are frequent and rare cases of cutaneous necrosis have been described.	0.4806265774314794
However, no reports of large, painful, cutaneous-subcutaneous infiltrates after interferon beta therapy have been published.	0.5778159410338773
In adults, infectious spondylitis is a rare but severe disease, caused by a bacterial thrombus in tissue of reduced resistance.	0.6861059823426365
In conventional radiographs initial findings are a narrowing of the intervertebral space, local osteoporosis and poorly defined erosive borders of the vertebral endplates.	0.6263534775552564
These changings can be found at least three to six weeks after the onset of disease.	0.7788738269695037
However, in Szintigraphy and MRT pathologic alterations are evident after ten to twelve days.	0.48052992364280933
Thus, early diagnosis and treatment becomes possible.	0.8221109947926759
In early stages of the disease a localized lysis surrounded by a reactive sclerosis appears in predisposed areas of the vertebral body (subchondral, anterobasal, ventral, central).	0.5881185985362236
Apparently, a soft tissue tumor is associated.	0.6302838134017802
Sclerosis and reduction of the soft tissue tumor are the first signs of repair processes.	0.6270394464514045
After at least 12 weeks, computed tomography can reveal typical sintering of the vertebral body and occasionally the development of a bony sequester.	0.5835516946240952
In addition, MRT as well as CT can be helpful in the detection and localization of complications as abscesses or affection of the vertebral canal.	0.6687342744198874
The tuberculous spondylitis can sometimes cause difficulties in differential diagnosis.	0.22239500527174885
Clinical findings, affection of several vertebral bodies, large soft tissue tumors with appearance of calcification as well as not typical locations are strongly suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis, but these findings are not specific of the disease.	0.6313039076457199
Degenerative disorders such as erosive osteochondrosis or changings due to chronic dialysis (e. g. amyloid or crystal arthropathies) may cause even more problems in differential diagnosis.	0.5127718700616438
Typical for a blastomatous process is the integrity of the interverebral disc space, which is a rare finding in spondylitis.	0.7820611410591383
To show the possibilities of imaging diagnostic procedures using high and extremely high resolution ultrasonic probes we investigated the anatomic structures of the foot.	0.594841345619613
We examinated 10 cadaver foots of the anatomic institute and in a clinical trial 20 healthy patients with 10 to 20-MHz-probes and could identify correctly single tendons and ligaments even in the toe region.	0.5377125466162802
Especially the possibility of dynamic examination had to be mentioned beside the other advantages of ultrasound diagnostic (saving of expenses, lack of radiation, side-to-side comparison).	0.5489936402829164
An essential parameter for the incorporation of drugs and narcotics into head hair is the content of hair pigment (melanins).	0.451583805881264
Toxicological studies of hair should therefore take the colour of the hair into consideration.	0.5359692884705622
As the available vocabulary for verbal characterisation is small and the description depends on the subjective opinion of the viewer, it was the purpose of this study to investigate if colorimetric measurements allow objectivation of hair colour.	0.6819412069782966
The natural hair colour of 17 subjects was described subjectively in words and by comparing it with a hair colour chart (Wella, Darmstadt, Germany).	0.44876141828792243
Subsequently the colours of the hair and the samples of the hair colour chart used for comparison were measured by colorimetric analysis and the CIEL*a*b* values were determined.	0.5961428698454181
The descriptive categorisation of the hair colours (e.g.	0.371710626683632
blonde, brown, black) could often not be recognised in the colorimetric results.	0.5020740785451444
Sometimes considerable differences were also found between the colour values of the natural hair samples and the specimens used for comparison.	0.6928379219074441
When the colour measurements were repeated at intervals of several days the results were found to be reproducible.	0.6805427905781171
We measured the ventilatory pattern and additional work of breathing (WOBadd) at three different levels of inspiratory pressure support [IPS 5, 10, 15 mbar above positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)] and in a new ventilatory mode, automatic tube compensation (ATC), in nine operative patients without lung injury nine patients ventilated for several following acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI).	0.6513426631133011
In ATC, endotracheal tube resistance is compensated automatically by means of closed-loop control of the calculated tracheal pressure.	0.5268589854707217
Pressure support in this mode, i. e. airway pressure above PEEP, is equal to the actual flow-dependent pressure drop across the endotracheal tube (ETT).	0.5951980229085196
Airway pressure rises at the beginning of inspiration and falls towards the end.	0.37510543584493206
As the tube resistance of ETT seriously hinders expiration and can cause desynchronization between ventilator and patient, airway pressure is reduced below PEEP during expiration in the same way as it is increased during inspiration.	0.5074889824092548
The result is a near-constant tracheal pressure at PEEP both during inspiration and during expiration.	0.45224535657412573
This mode could be best termed as "electronic extubation".	0.3576666125120707
The most striking difference between the postoperative patients and the ARI patients was their minute ventilation (17.8+/-1.85 l/min in ARI patients vs 7.3+/-3.1 l/min in the postoperative patients).	0.8696643499848321
In the postoperative patients augmentation of IPS from 5 to 15 mbar induced a steady increase in tidal volume (VT) and a consecutive decrease in respiratory rate (rr) compared with ATC (VTATC,postop= 463+/-78 ml; rrATC,postop =16+/-4 min-1; VTIPS5,postop = 505+/-79 ml; rrIPS5,postop = 15+/-4 min-1; VTIPS10,postop = 562+/-86 ml; rrIPS15,postop =14+/-4 min-1; VTIPS15,postop=660+/- 151 ml; rrTPS15, postop = 12+/-4 min-1), whereas the augmentation of IPS of 5 and 10 mbar in the ARI patients could not compensate for the increase in rr and the decrease in VT, after switching from ATC to IPS (VTATC,ARI 724+/-308 ml, rrATC,ARI = 24+/-6 min-1; VTIPS5,ARI = 649+/-315 ml; rrIPS 5,ARI = 27+/-8 min-1; VTIPS10,ARI=653+/-353 ml; rrIPS10,ARI = 25+/-8 min-1: Even IPS 15 was not able to reestablish VT at the values observed during ATC (VTIPS15,ARI =680+/-312 ml).	0.609696372621619
During ATC WOBadd was small in both postoperative and ARI patients (WOBadd,ATC,postop = 93+/-36 mJ/l, WOBadd,ATC,ARI =116 +/-72 mJ/l).	0.5553365736568707
In the postoperative patients, an inspiratory pressure support of 5 mbar was not sufficient to compensate WOBadd compared with ATC.	0.7002782962360968
However, IPS 10 and 15 mbar were able to compensate for WOBadd (WOBadd.ATC5,postop WOBadd,IPS5,postop =189+/-77 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS10,postop = 55+/-30 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS15,postop = 21+/-11 mJ/l).	0.567834154363608
In the ARI patients an IPS 5, 10 or 15 mbar was not sufficient to compensate for WOBadd (WOBadd,IPS 5,ARI = 1126+/-262 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS 10,ARI 863+/-253 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS 15,ARI 763+/-298 mJ/l).	0.5748761458510692
Under ATC, WOBadd was only 15% of WOBadd under IPS of 15 mbar.	0.6114895720463259
All but two patients were successfully extubated after the investigation.	0.5785521361602803
These two patients were not extubated because they were dependent on an FIO2 >0.5.	0.6234984502626537
Our results strongly indicate that ventilatory dependence in ARI patients may be caused by the ETT rather than by mechanical dysfunction of the lung.	0.617653148532158
ATC is a very helpful mode to use in distinguishing between ventilatory failure caused by ETT and real ventilatory dependence.	0.5179056394135637
The preoperative localization of pharmaco-resistent focal epilepsies before surgery and the prognosis concerning seizure outcome are both of importance.	0.5378050187808341
In addition to conventional MRI diagnostics for the detection of small epileptogenic lesions, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (HMR spectroscopy) can be useful for assessing the bilaterality of pathological changes in cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies.	0.5662884823764492
The technique and findings of HMR spectroscopy are reported in patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies.	0.4778090921839442
The findings indicate that chemical shift imaging (CSI) investigations of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres provide important information for the prediction of seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery.	0.4880007162898097
This paper describes the conceptual considerations in planning and realizing an inpatient unit for traumatized patients.	0.3388186399302205
The different concepts of the dynamic of the traumatic disease and the aetiopathology of posttraumatic stressdisease (PTSD) are highly significant in regard to the realisation of differing concepts of inpatient therapy of trauma.	0.6163015410234483
The utilisation of Konzentrative Bewegungstherapy (KBT) and Creative Therapy in our conflict- and solution-oriented analytic concept permits us to neglect a fictitious contradiction between traumaexposure and traumalimitation and a "potential space" (Winnicott) can be opened to the creative work with the patients.	0.5222176760408762
This paper illustrates with some casuistic examples the utilisation of KBT in transforming the traumatic body-flashbacks into narrative memory-scripts, by the use of symbolizing processes.	0.43245199331446127
In 55 consecutive patients with the same dual chamber pacemaker (Relay, Intermedics) and different pacing leads, the influence of different safety margins for pacing on battery current was investigated.	0.675174438688931
2.8 +/- 0.9 years after implantation, atrial and ventricular pulse-width thresholds (tRS) (ms) were determined at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 V, and the charge delivered at threshold was telemetered.	0.9161359434194848
If tRS was <1.50 ms at 0.5 V, an amplitude of 1.0 V was programmed in the atrium and the ventricule; if tRS was <1.50 ms at 1.0 V, then an amplitude of 2.0 V was chosen.	0.7159768475085421
Two times the charge threshold (2x QRS), two times the voltage threshold (2x URS), and three times the pulse-width threshold (3x tRS) were programmed as the safety margins for pacing.	0.671976570636447
With every safety margin, battery current (IRS) (µA) was averaged from 5 telemetric readings in D00 mode with 70 bpm.	0.5231038829125596
IBat was significantly lower with 2x QRS as compared with 2x URS (13.43 +/- 1.0 vs. 14.20 +/- 1.2 µA, p<0.01) and as compared with 3x tRS (13.99 +/- 1.2 µA, p<0.05).	0.6747065091320197
Pacemaker longevity derived from these current data was significantly longer with 2x QRS (112 +/- 8 months) as compared with 2x URS (106 +/- 9, p<0.01) and as compared with 3x tRS (108 +/- 8, p<0.05).	0.6928128691717013
If current consumption is compared intraindividually in dependance on the programmed amplitude, battery current is significantly lower at 1.0 V as compared with 2.0 V resulting in a mean reduction of 0.63 µA (-4.9%, p<0.05) and an average gain in longevity of 5 months.	0.7855217677102343
This applies to every safety margin tested.	0.33021689203784016
Differences in battery current caused by the safety margins will translate into a greater gain in longevity in future pacemaker models with reduced internal current consumption.	0.4472808285831171
Any medical procedure must be legally authorized by the patient, giving informed consent.	0.554423663281514
This prerequisite is based on the right to self determination.	0.7702097169273014
Otherwise a medical procedure is considered as physical injury.	0.5273919600109621
Thus, the way, how a specific procedure is performed, predominantly depends on the patient's will.	0.8325249621971228
The attending physician's duty is to find out this will, which is especially important when old patients and patients incapable of giving valid consent are involved.	0.6434215556815992
Before the procedure the physician has to have a confidential talk with the patient.	0.6495741517920632
He has to point out the best treatment possible considering the individual circumstances of the patient's life.	0.707616293311068
The physician has to find out, weather the patient is competent to refuse or consent to treatement.	0.5923042092910877
Furthermore the consultation is an opportunity to diminish the patient's fear and to increase his confidence.	0.5411619516511991
The main problem treating old patients is that they often lack the mental ability for appreciation of the nature of the situation.	0.6380005914322393
One has to differentiate between the physiological mental decay and dementia or psychiatric diseases.	0.49483470783496275
In these cases a third party consent is necessary.	0.5128694365827411
This review of German neurology during the Nazi era mentions first the significance of Jewish neurologists for the history of the specialty, and the irreplaceable loss that their expulsion from Germany represented.	0.5665667700796287
A brief discussion of the scientific accomplishments of German neurologists during this time is followed by a description of violations of ethical principles, exemplified by the human experiments of G. Schaltenbrand.	0.5656832814509154
The spirit of the age exerted a malevelent influence.	0.31336047742148065
A postal survey targeted at 1000 firms in the metal- and electronic working industry of Northrhine Westfalia was carried out by Sozialforschungsstelle Dortmund und Institute of geronotology to analyze the implementation of the collective agreement concerning partial retirement.	0.48500930212964644
As the results show, firms in Northrhine Westfalia are willing to accept the collective agreement and use partial retirement though there are still problems left to solve.	0.5546061046602406
Firms are further using partial retirement as an instrument of early retirement.	0.42212504672738266
Therefore partial retirement is created as a so-called "blocked model".	0.3407008756864568
From February 1991 to May 1998, 340 patients had a cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) implanted.	0.5365434208371164
Mean age was 64  +/-  9 years, 278 male and 62 female.	0.6388147472242893
60% of patients had coronary artery disease and 31% dilative cardiomyopathy.	0.8623732052890455
Ejection fraction was 38  +/-  14%.	0.5211963452510894
The indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was in 57% of patients ventricular tachycardia, in 43% ventricular fibrillation.	0.7614754425163416
298 patients had a single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator implanted, 42 patients a dual-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator.	0.5872715499052343
In 25 patients additional subcutaneous patch or array electrodes and in 2 patients additional epicardial patch electrodes were implanted.	0.49969994037869886
Implantation site was in 92 patients abdominal and in 248 pectoral.	0.37521334998100714
Over a period of 7 years 34 lead-related complications occured in 33 patients (9.7%), after a median of 2 months after implantation.	0.7725271157088865
Diagnosis was made by routine chest x-ray in about 55% of lead-related complications, by clinical presentation (inadequate therapy, pain) in 24%, and by electrical parameters in 21%.	0.8327283966023912
In patients with an abdominal implantation site, lead-related complications occurred in 20%, in contrast to 6% in patients with a pectoral implantation site.	0.9618006921904363
Regarding patients with pectoral implantation site, lead-related complications were observed in 12% of patients with a dual-chamber ICD vs 4% with a single-chamber ICD (p = 0.05), due to dislocation of atrial electrodes with dual-chamber ICD.	0.8064547222165399
There were no differences in clinical parameters between patients with pectoral vs abdominal and between single vs dual-chamber ICD.	0.5661058639557909
Several new approaches are available for early defibrillation.	0.5356105070759287
One example is semiautomatic defibrillators used by the first arriving emergency staff.	0.48198225633256125
The recommendations for introducing emergency medical technician (EMT) defibrillation in Germany are based either on the results in cities with so called doctor-manned-ambulances or the experiences of the German multi-center-study.	0.5953075983557695
This analysis intends to contribute data to an EMT defibrillation program in cities with a so called rendezvous-system.	0.44153034806947167
Methods: In a prospective study a EMT-defibrillation group (= DG) was compared with a standard group (basic life support by EMTs and defibrillation by emergency physicians) (= SG) and a control group (emergency physicians starting resuscitation alone or together with EMTs) (= CG).	0.7993866858841853
In the DG semiautomatic defibrillators from Laerdal (Heartstart 3000) were used.	0.5589372085690126
Successfully resuscitated patients were followed up with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the Pittsburgh Brain Stem Score (PBSS), and Pittsburgh Cerebral (CPC) and Overall Performance Categorie (OPC).	0.5816063136009962
Results: Over 13 months 43 patients were included, primarily presenting with ventricular fibrillation (VF).	0.5307139952550045
Depending on the first arriving emergency staff the patients were allocated to the DG (n = 12), to the SG (n = 18) or to the CG (n = 13).	0.6934807345426574
DG and SG did not differ significantly concerning the primary survival rate or the long-term prognosis (primary successful 8.3% vs. 38.9%, definite successful 0% vs. 27.8%).	0.5945552159867113
The primary survival rate in the DG was significantly lower than in the CG (8.3% vs. 61.5%).	0.7127413227672685
In the long term survival rate there were no significant differences.	0.6987247080182586
In the DG significantly less patients received bystander CPR (8.3%) than in the other groups (55.6% and 69.2%).	0.8116678549626796
Neither the variable "witnessed collapes" nor "bystander CPR" had a significant influence for the outcome of the patients in this study.	0.7704973587229421
The average response time for the first arriving rescue team was 5.5 +/- 2.4 min, without a significant difference between the groups.	0.8840809984624567
Conclusions: A comparison of this study with American, European and German recommendations for EMT defibrillation programms revealed some deviations.	0.6177140455635385
Bystander CPR seems to be of special importance as well as the time interval between defibrillation and the arrival of the emergency physician.	0.7720117862915387
A benefit of EMT defibrillation could not be demonstrated in our "rendezvous-system", possibly because the time interval was less than 4 min (3.5 min).	0.8203937280653495
Since the result is in accordance with the German multi-center-study, a critical consideration of a EMT defibrillation program seems to be necessary in "Rendezvous-systems".	0.7162835231236816
Ninety-two strains of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) from 80 patients of 31 hospitals in 11 federal states were analyzed.	0.465902698111035
They were primarily isolated in intensive care units (general, surgical, internistic, pediatric, oncological ones), but also in nephrologic/dialysis or neurologic/orthopaedic wards.	0.6239516619120373
A dominance of VanA type E. faecium strains was observed (n=81; 88.0%).	0.46814156355399866
In addition, strains of E. faecalis (VanA; n=4; 4.4%), E. faecium (VanB; n=1; 1.1%), and E. gallinarum (VanC1, n=6; 6.5%) were found.	0.710490664030055
The 81 VanA strains of E. faecium possessed the following resistances to other antibiotics: erythromycin, ciprofloxacin (both 93.8%), ampicillin, oxytetracycline (both 88.9%), rifampicin (79.0%), trimethoprim/sulfameracin (61.7%), chloramphenicol (18.9%), fusidic acid (12.3%), quinupristin/dalfopristin (7.4%); gentamicin (46.9%) and streptomycin (37.0%), also together with ampicillin resistance (9.9-35.8%).	0.596873035116323
In some of these VanA type strains resistance to teicoplanin cannot be completely expressed in-vitro.	0.5514582900841556
Macrorestriction analysis of E. faecium outbreak isolates (VanA type) from hospitals in different federal states indicated an intra- and interhospital spread of a defined strain.	0.6599032357937219
However, heterogeneous plasmid and plasmid restriction patterns showed that these strains were not completely identical.	0.3703437763053184
The scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury of the shoulder girdle, mostly associated with polytraumatized critically ill patients.	0.7671205699613175
This case report of 3 patients shows the variety of possible injuries combined with SD.	0.6120664356353362
Diagnosis and therapy in such a rare trauma, which is most likely seen in specialized trauma centres are being described.	0.7656062724607477
The 3 patients are presented from trauma to management, with remarks to various possibilities in treatment.	0.6294809895532578
Reports of other groups include multicenter studies with small numbers of patients, making it different to look for homogenity or defining standards, whereas current guidelines are being mentioned, including remarks on the management of these mostly polytraumatized and vitally endangered patients.	0.5484988957679043
This is a case report on arthroscopic removal of a glass splinter from the knee joint of a 56-year-old male.	0.747470618461411
Recurrent hemarthrosis of the knee was the reason for differential diagnosis, as the patient could not remember any trauma.	0.8888166982274973
After performing MRI, a 12 x 5 mm signal-free zone showed up in the area of the lateral condylus femoris, which was identified through arthroscopy as a glass splinter and removed.	0.6833218967720829
The patient was discharged soon after without any complaints.	0.6166306399810918
Many patients with acquired strabismus do not suffer from diplopia and confusion after an individually and age-dependent interval.	0.4502360750667433
They inhibit the image of the deviated eye by binocular rilvary and particularly by the physiological ability to disregard visually disturbing stimuli.	0.4317398226482886
Red cells, platelet concentrates and fresh frozen plasma of a single donation contain leucocytes, causing a lot of side effects.	0.563454971241381
Modern filtration- and apheresis-techniques lead to a reduction of residual leucocyte counts of <1x106 per unit.	0.6408980619104095
The best method to achieve controlled and validated conditions is the blood bank performed standardised prestorage-filtration.	0.3866746306943592
This is an effective method, to prevent cytokine-mediated and leucocyte-mediated febrile nonhaemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR), to prevent a primary immunisation to leucocyte- and histocompatibility-antigens, to avoid transmission of viral infections by blood transfusion, e.g.	0.6978578935379789
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and to exclude in special cases bacterial septicaemia.	0.691564012447902
In addition, there are references to reduce the postoperative infections, the rate of recurrence of a tumor and the postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.	0.9271358276577039
The use of leucocyte-depleted blood components for special indications is meanwhile established.	0.4032498297942951
Some European countries have made a decision for a general filtration of all blood components containing leucocytes.	0.43623566471523684
The authors recommend the general leucocyte-depletion of blood components considering the German medical law (AMG) and cost/benefit ratio.	0.5332560293786505
Evaluation of psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatment frequently uses rating scales without regard for patients' defensiveness.	0.3748536436689016
This study demonstrates on 309 psychotherapy patients treated with inpatient client-centered therapy and followed-up 1 year after treatment that defensiveness, measured with validity scales of personality inventories MMPI-K, FPI-R and Gießen-Test, influences ratings (scales CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES) before and after therapy.	0.4736011650552335
Patients who deny psychopathology on admission do so at discharge and to some extent at follow-up.	0.33179002005817826
The extent of effect is significantly diminished with an increase in frankness in these patients, indicated by the significant improvement in validity scales.	0.5533608735294746
Inpatient client-centered psychotherapy improved defensiveness in the case of initial self-criticism and diminished it in the case of initial retentiveness.	0.5001680001829001
Introduction: Because of their frequency and consequences sciatica remains a demanding clinical entity with significant social and economical impact.	0.5389789549042958
There is a high demand on therapeutic modalities, using folk medicine methods in the treatment of orthopaedic  diseases.	0.6731123341976818
No data is available on the usefullness of methods like natural herbs in combination with acupuncture.	0.45988462476711545
Aim of our study was to present data on the effect of acupuncture and cytokineinhibiting natural herbs in sciatic pain.	0.5156516744310954
We compared these  results with nerve root infiltration by local anaesthetics and corticosteroids in our  orthopaedic outpatient clinic.	0.5378195978453062
Materials and Results: 278 patients with chronic pain for at least 3 months were observed.	0.6389762833163688
All three therapeutical modalities showed improvement of pain scores.	0.30173147250727184
Best  results were gained with steroid injection (n=26; 66% pain reduction), acupuncture in combination with herbs improved the pain in average of 62% (n=230), whereas injection with local anaesthetic had a pain reduction of 48% (n=22).	0.5681763282989497
Sole Mepivacain-HCl treatment had significant less pain reduction compared to the other treatment modalities.	0.5443974700083892
Conclusion: According to our results acupuncture in combination with herbs and  steroid nerve blocks appear to be an effective and thus recommendable conservative  therapy in cases of sciatic pain.	0.6566397710087208
Taking into account that patients increasingly prefer ethnomedical modalities of treatment our study gains importance for practising  orthopaedists.	0.43658156837341744
This paper concerns advances in the integration of psychotherapy in psychiatric education and clinical practice and whether they go along with increasing research activities.	0.5473917037630351
To find answers, a survey on psychotherapy research was carried out in all German psychiatric hospitals and departments by means of a questionnaire.	0.6176281009878285
The results indicate that psychotherapy research is done nearly exclusively in university hospitals.	0.39741650175378307
About half of them had already published psychotherapy studies and two thirds of them are presently carrying out studies, mostly including prospective, randomized clinical trials.	0.6481562418546036
These studies cover the whole spectrum of psychiatric disorders: substance abuse, schizophrenic and affective disorders, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive and personality disorders.	0.4951683224208318
To improve psychotherapy research conditions further, efforts are necessary to increase scientific exchange, financial support, and the integration of institutions outside the universities.	0.6437087996824192
There is little to suggest that the course of preeclamsia can be substantially affected by drug treatment.	0.5538712539133959
The vast majority of randomized studies do not indicate beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment on proteinuria, fetal heart rate abnormalities, abruptio placentae and the incidence of preterm birth.	0.48404862815117566
There is also no definite effect on the development of superimposed preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, renal failure or eclampsia.	0.5948139211280046
Moreover, blood pressure lowering agents fail to improve uteroplacental perfusion but may have adverse effects on fetal growth.	0.5397300625997237
Antihypertensive treatment is only indicated in severe hypertension ( > 170/110 mm Hg) to reduce the risk of cerebral hemorrhage.	0.7657376567550839
Dihydralazine injections may result in reduced placental blood flow and fetal distress.	0.46812316598378556
Oral nifedipine offers some advantages in view of more potent vasodilator actions on uterine and fetoplacental vessels and a lower incidence of fetal distress.	0.4582587253050422
Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanism of eclamptic seizure is cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant ischemia.	0.45685047757992336
Cerebral vessels are particularly sensitive to magnesium, which works by reversing cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant improvement in blood flow.	0.4924463468326065
Controlled trials have shown magnesium to be superior to both placebo and phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia.	0.4274442037726476
Furthermore, magnesium has been found to be more effective than diazepam and phenytoin in preventing recurrence of seizures in women with eclampsia.	0.615264233789746
Also the neonatal outcome favors magnesium, which is now generally accepted as the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclampsia.	0.7105821837027022
Baker's cysts were treated operatively in 19 patients in the Department of Traumatology of the University of Cologne from 1988 to 1997.	0.6470357841048661
The subjective and objective results were evaluated with a questionnaire and a clinical examination and sonography (follow-up: 95 %).	0.719522153589774
All patients were examinated before surgery, sonography and X-ray of the knee were performed.	0.7761760759361653
We differentiated between the congenital primary cyst (39 %), and the secondary form, which was always associated with an intraarticular lesion (61 %).	0.7781524497282174
Arthroscopy was performed in all secondary forms of Baker's cyst.	0.5972863773056047
Postoperative complications were two reinterventions due to one hematoma and one effusion.	0.4317513676303654
Patient's evaluation of operation result was "excellent" in 61 % and "good" in 39 % of cases.	0.8388210362407192
All knee joints had a full range of motion.	0.43733118186131953
There was only one case of a recurrent cyst.	0.8420615536130871
The primary form of Baker's cyst has always to be extirpated, according to our clinical experience.	0.4959385078189628
The extirpation of the secondary Baker's cyst and the relevance of arthroscopy and treatment of the basic disease have to be discussed.	0.7208530030322214
In median avcuate ligament syndrome, compression of the celiac artery is caused by an abnormally low insertion of the median arcuate ligament in the presence of normally located celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.	0.4946151949172568
A lot of controversy exists concerning the indication for operation and the best mode of treatment.	0.544335054435311
Depending on the presence and quality of collateral pathways, the symptoms vary considerably.	0.7584034857566503
We report a rare case of arcuate ligament syndrome with two-vessel involvement.	0.5278004061905847
In such cases surgical treatment seems to offer substantial benefit.	0.5433065695375142
Usually transsection of the compressing arcuate ligament is sufficient.	0.2771472667454748
Bypass procedures should remain limited to cases in which transsection does not enable a significant increase in splanchnic blood flow.	0.4764989345012734
The microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films for the diagnosis of malaria is a highly sensitive technique.	0.4457076879959964
However, the expertise required is a major disadvantage.	0.7021366774705298
Recently, methods not dependent on microscopy have become commercially available.	0.4053874255059401
The use of an antigen-capture assay for the detection of histidine-rich protein 2, an antigen specific for Plasmodium falciparum, forms the basis of the ParaSight-F (Becton Dickinson) and the ICT Malaria Pf test (ICT Diagnostics).	0.5860358725806196
Parasite lactate dehydrogenase is the basis of another immunographic dipstick assay developed by Flow Inc.	0.3510811380678092
These currently available assays have been evaluated in a number of trials giving sensitivities and specificities of 90-100%.	0.42310878133274465
A decreased sensitivity is found in cases with low parasitemia.	0.6580567763408641
However, false-negative  results have also been reported in patients with high parasite densities.	0.7359597651130513
Purpose: Discussion in the literature of peripheral nerve lesions after surgical treatment is based mainly on orthopedic surgery or on ischemic syndromes.	0.7183983451171336
There is no information about the frequency of nerve lesions after revascularization of the lower limb.	0.801302369638381
Methods: Between 1992 and 1996, 436 patients underwent peripheral arterial revascularization, including 147 cases of deep revascularization, 127 supra-genicular femoro-popliteal bypasses, 116 infra-genicular femoro-popliteal bypasses and 56 femoro-crural bypasses.	0.44676381828861084
Mean patient age was 70.5 +/- 5.8 years; 182 patients were female and 254 were male.	0.5385452257787389
There was a 38% rate (166/436) of reoperation.	0.659880445181518
All patients were examined based on anamnestic information and a detailed clinical neurological investigation, including the methods of Weber and Moberg.	0.7209715517310115
Results: We found eleven patients (4%) with peripheral nerve lesions after the primary operation.	0.9586177535270239
After the reoperation 55 patients (33%) had nerve lesions.	0.6165621768410484
Conclusions: Peripheral nerve lesions with sensory disturbance were present in 15% of our patients on discharge from hospital.	0.7319525850141235
They had mainly dysesthesia and hypesthesia but no kind of motor dysfunction.	0.28636787558128524
In our opinion, detailed preoperative information is very important because of the risk of sensitive nerve lesions.	0.5696193187285076
Classic and HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) are predominantly found in male Caucasians.	0.6115543945784043
It is unclear why KS is so rare in women.	0.3851384308909069
At the Department of Dermatology, University of Frankfurt, epidemic KS was diagnosed in 299/751 (40%) male and 5/72 (18%) female HIV-infected patients.	0.5467105332685701
To detect common parameters regarding immunodeficiency, hormonal disturbances, abnormalities in clinical course, or sexual practices, data of eight women with KS (five HIV+, three HIV-) were compared.	0.7632167950260417
In HIV+ women KS is more aggressive than in HIV- women and more aggressive than in HIV+ men.	0.5123149414180576
Early and frequent visceral involvement and no preference for the lower extremities are found.	0.4966125065582027
Compared to HIV- women with KS, HIV+ women are generally younger (mean age 38 vs 71 years) and significantly immunodeficient (reduced absolute CD4 cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio).	0.6148113534192389
All women with KS investigated for sexual hormones (7/8) showed abnormalities: 7/7 had low oestrogens, 4/6 low LH and 3/5 low progesterone.	0.6629844265703129
Controls (n=11, HIV+ without KS) showed a clear trend for higher serum levels of sexual hormones, but the difference was not significant.	0.7204499316217736
Although different reasons for low levels of oestrogens (drug abuse, marasmus, menopause) must be considered, the lack of oestrogens seems to be a common finding in HIV+ and HIV- women with KS.	0.646385355245219
There was no correlation between sexual practices (anal or oral-faecal contacts) and the manifestation or aggressiveness of KS.	0.6129623089407806
The aim of the study was the assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function and left ventricular mass following aortic valve replacement (AVR) due to aortic valve stenosis as well as the influence of regression of LV hypertrophy in patients with normal and impaired LV systolic function prior to surgery.	0.6845556176426032
74 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (29 female, 45 male, mean age 66  +/-  18 years) were divided into 2 groups according to LV ejection fraction (EF): Group 1 with EF > 50% (n = 40); Group 2 with EF <= 50% (n = 34).	0.8026055576555131
Furthermore, patients were differentiated into a group A without (n = 53) and a group B with aortic regurgitation (<= II °, n = 21).	0.8266199261203312
All patients were examined by transthoracic echocardiography before and 1 month after surgery.	0.8804064079103994
There was a significant decrease of LV enddiastolic and endsystolic valume indices following AVR in group 2 and group B.	0.6185425514316127
Patients with preoperatively lower EF (group 2) showed an increase in LV ejection fraction from 39  +/-  10% before AVR to 47  +/-  11% after AVR (p < 0.001), whereas patients with preoperative normal EF (group 1) showed a significant decrease in EF (from 62  +/-  8% to 57  +/-  10%, p < 0.05).	0.7578066002476357
Also patients with combined aortic valve disease before AVR had an increase of EF after surgery (from 45 %plusmn; 14% to 56  +/-  14%, p < 0.03).	0.6481718600903389
There were significant decreases of interventricular septum thickness and LV posterior wall thickness in group 1 and group A, whereas a significant decrease of LV anddiastolic diameter index was noted only in group B.	0.6330572622955591
Improvement of the NYHA functional class could be demonstrated in group 2 from 2.8  +/-  0.7 before to 2.2  +/-  0.6 after AVR, as well as in group B from 2.9  +/-  0.7 before to 1.9  +/-  0.7 after surgery.	0.8761439511122365
In conclusion, patients with impaired LV function or combined aortic valve disease showed a significant improvement of left ventricular systolic function after AVR, while patients with normal LV function presented a slight decrease of EF.	0.7357249861231367
There was a significant regression of left ventricular muscle mass in all groups independent of the left ventricular functional status.	0.8685291660823105
Cardiomyocytes lose the ability to proliferate after birth.	0.2787334382010088
Subsequently, irreversible cellular damage, e.g., during myocardial infarction, causes loss of functional properties and cell replacement by fibrotic tissue.	0.5531192584743057
It is, therefore, not surprising that cell replacement strategies such as cardiomyocyte transplantation in damaged myocardium or scar tissue has gained widespread interest.	0.4497257116458609
In other species such as mice, rats, and dogs, the technical feasibility of skeletal myoblast-, satellite cell-, and fetal cardiomyocyte engraftment into normal and diseased myocardium has been demonstrated by simple injection methods.	0.5977087803601849
Repeatedly, it has been shown that transplanted cells may survive for weeks within host myocardium and build intercellular connections such as grap junctions and desmosomes.	0.5551650817911138
In contrast, grafthost connections have not, as yet, been convincingly demonstrated.	0.5161635904312152
Hypothetically, cell transplants might exhibit the following functional properties: stabilization of diseased tissue to prevent structural remodeling; carrier for recombinant proteins, growth factors or drugs to induce molecular alterations of host myocardium; and improvement of regional and global myocardial function due to active contractility.	0.48725314932279906
However, clear evidence of coordinated contractility of transplanted cells, and, thus, of a clinically relevant therapeutical use of cardiomyocyte transplantation as a replacement strategy for damaged host cardiac cells, remains to be demonstrated.	0.6478627138060715
Concomitant with advances in medicine, involving the development and use of antibiotics, immunosuppressive drugs, organ / stem cell transplantation and pre-existing illnesses such as AIDS, the frequency of fungal infection has increased dramatically.	0.6760977524508104
These factors determine the susceptibility of the lung for an acute or chronic course of disease.	0.6151105968598919
Purpose: We evaluated the speed of sound (SOS) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) at the os calcis as an indicator of osteoporosis and observed the age-related changes in ultrasound values in normal women.	0.712157124712096
Materials and methods: BUA and SOS were measured in 236 women using the "Achilles" densitometer (Lunar, Madison, Ohio).	0.38993220792022637
From the BUA and SOS values the BUA/SOS Index ("Stiffness" Index) is calculated.	0.5795807506257292
We investigated 55 female patients with osteoporosis (aged 43-85 years) and 181 healthy women (aged 20-80 years).	0.6667124976419678
Results: Ultrasound values for women with osteoporosis were significantly lower than those for the normal control group.	0.6239786740228033
The Z-score compared with young normals was higher for the BUA/SOS Index (-3.1) than for BUA (-2.5) and SOS (-3.0).	0.9079692826139845
At a BUA/SOS Index of 68 the sensitivity was 85 %, and the specificity was 77 % for patients with osteoporotic fractures.	0.7707928558156425
We found a significant decline with age in SOS (r = -0.55), BUA (r = -0.50) and BUA/SOS Index (r = -0.57).	0.4666809536711403
Conclusion: Ultrasound bone densitometry at the os calcis can be used as a screening test in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	0.6556016778533772
A treatment procedure requires the consent of the patient, but this is legally effective only if he is capable of giving his consent and can be informed accordingly.	0.6086281163199249
Because of demographic development and the progress of medicine, the number of patients who are not able to give their consent is increasing.	0.7592270991264516
In practice, we make do with the presumed consent of the patient or, for procedures that can wait, with the consent of legitimate family members.	0.7857987732249312
An initiative action is suggested by physicians and hospitals that should reduce this gray zone and the forensic risks drastically.	0.4268827352873957
A number of studies has shown a significant relationship between life events/life conditions and depression.	0.5602644886941204
However, there is only a small number of studies investigating the effect of life events/life conditions in patients with severe depression from the endogenous subtype.	0.7621732660688566
The present study examines the significance of the patients' life events/life conditions for the two year outcome of the illness in a prospective study with assessments every three months.	0.845943207339237
Patients are compared to healthy controls with regard to the period three months prior to the admission to the hospital at the index episode.	0.6532181663907453
The results confirm the importance of life events and life conditions for the long term outcome of depressed patients with endogenous subtype respectively severe major depression in-patients.	0.6938826420429459
Relapsers show considerably more undesirable life conditions than non-relapsers three to six months prior to their relapse.	0.4429405786844877
Depressed patients indicate significantly more undesirable life events and life conditions and fewer desirable life conditions in comparison to the control group for the time span three months prior to their hospitalisation.	0.5907055707475104
Since the availability of protease inhibitors in 1997, there has been a great change in antiretroviral therapy but also new long term side effects have emerged, mainly metabolic changes such as hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterinemia and hyperglycemia.	0.5589477582727683
Besides, fat redistribution has been observed.	0.26830417461022493
Fat wastes in the face and limbs but accumulates in the adipose tissue of the dorsocervical and abdominal region and the breasts.	0.49979631775832134
The mechanism of these changes remains unclear.	0.5633833999024218
For therapy a protease inhibitor free therapy or lipid lowering drugs may be tried.	0.40019196724447803
29 of our 224 patients developed lipodystrophy.	0.3101403334594655
27 of these patients had been treated with a protease inhibitor (17 patients with indinavir); 2 of the patients had never received protease inhibitors.	0.940954888531304

DNA-cytophotometry is one of the methods that may contribute to a more precise evaluation of the biological behaviour of tumours in addition to the WHO-classification.	0.8292720181277321
In this study 121 tumour specimens of 50 patients suffering from gliomas with one or up to three recurrencies were investigated.	0.5964487080777582
In all cases the histological type and WHO-grade and the Ki-67/MIB1 labeling index were determined.	0.5698911318527174
DNA cytophotometry was performed after single cell preparation on Feulgen-stained preparations, and the following parameters were calculated: stemline ploidy, 5c-exceeding rate, and 2c-deviation index.	0.5889790050922283
There is a world-wide renaissance of neurosurgical treatments of Parkinson's disease (PD), based on substantial progress in basic sciences.	0.429331654619618
A model of parallel motor circuitry has identified potential targets for lesioning by clarifying the pathophysiological role of the basal ganglia in PD.	0.4826927068585436
The internal globus pallidus (Gpi) is an essential player as it connects to thalamocortical projections and can be disinhibited by overactivity of the nucleus subthalamicus (Nst).	0.5671110885132182
Lesioning of these targets has been successful in MPTP damaged primates.	0.28085374014872155
There is clinical use of destructive as well as restorative and stimulative technics.	0.4370457567646155
Pallidotomy and thalamatomy have evolved by the use of better neuroradiological and electrophysiological targeting.	0.3228974951710615
The first technic is used for treatment of rigidity, hypokinesia and dyskinesias, the latter one has proven to be efficient for tremor.	0.6722681269459644
Dopaminergic reinnervation and increased dopaminergic output of the striatum has only been seen after transplantation of fetal cells; this method however carries immunological and ethical problems.	0.5465120701930449
The continuous high frequency stimulation of basal ganglia is the newest technic; it is highly adaptable to the patient's need and carries a low morbidity profile.	0.6346298586136663
Thalamic stimulation is used for the treatment of tremor.	0.6147218160427205
The stimulation of Nst and Gpi are proposed for dyskinesias and on/off phenomena.	0.30491974296605917
Animal research further focuses on xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent precursor cells.	0.335840268440265
- In summary neurosurgical procedures seem to be verey promising; however longterm comparison studies are needed to define the best (combination) treatment(s) for the future.	0.7061155654823105
Concepts of documentation rely not only on the contents required and technical demands, but the procedures covered and in medical applications especially security aspects are also matters of critical concern.	0.580597813499348
Even though the need for effective documentation (i.e., adequate in content, availability, feasibility and easy to retrieve analysis) is not a question, tasks and aims (for example, quality of patient care) deserve attention and establishing efforts have to be analyzed regarding their structural and personal prerequisites and implications before particular tools for documentation can be developed.	0.6085736105576448
The Medtronic Thera/Thera-i (and Kappa 400) pacemakers utilize a mode switching algorithm that switches from the DDD/R mode to the DDIR mode in the presence on an atrial tachyarrhythmia.	0.45640652464995746
To accomplish this, the pacemaker keeps track of a mean atrial rate (MAR) which is a weighted index of the atrial rate.	0.7631316883857301
Once the MAR is greater than the programmed mode switch rate the pacemaker mode switches to the nontracking mode.	0.3458540384321328
Because the algorithm weights faster atrial rates more heavily than slow atrial rates, the algorithm is sensitive to a wide variety of atrial tachyarrhythmias, including those with varying amplitudes.	0.6405297504959503
Additionally, the algorithm provides a long PVARP and a rate adaptive (RA) AV interval.	0.48309462954559473
These not only help ensure that a wide range of atrial rates will be detected, but may also limit the time the patient tracks at the upper rate before mode switching.	0.5959149597802313
In order to assess the effectiveness of the algorithm, the Thera-i provides detailed diagnostics which provide information on the date, time, duration, and rate of the mode switch episodes.	0.7607007810065534
Additionally, more detailed beat-to-beat information is provided for each episode which can help determine its appropriateness and can assist in making programming changes.	0.5605039182000845
There is a lot of information in the literature about psychological disturbances in somatic diseases.	0.7432951514717326
For dermatological patients such data are not available.	0.4404134105354917
In early spring 1998 we studied the psychological changes in 247 hospitalized patients in the dermatological department of the Ruhr University Bochum.	0.5371293900653968
We used the German version of the internationally accepted Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	0.4523305266450578
We found the prevalance of psychological alterations ranged between 25,9% and 31%.	0.6262925211476521
The prevalence of psychological disturbances was a little higher than that seen in oncological, cardiological or neurological patient populations.	0.4958167107337342
Surprisingly skin cancer patients were less affected than patients with chronic inflammatory or angiological diseases.	0.5890945555586644
These results underline the necessity of improved psychological therapeutical strategies which must be standardized and evaluated.	0.375063261619632
In an analysis of 3,838 restrained car drivers, the proportion of acceleration related injury of the cervical spine increased from under 10 % in 1985 to over 30 % in 1997.	0.7571746915457476
These injuries occurred mainly in the case of head-on or multiple collisions.	0.47296166384101496
Letters were sent to 1,136 of the injured persons, and of the 138 patients who returned the questionnaires, 121 (88 %) were still suffering from their symptoms.	0.7070832690912472
It was a question of pain (74 %), tension (6 %) and stiffness (5 %) in the head (27 %), neck (55 %) and shoulder (8 %) area.	0.8593212987395823
The duration of the complaints was the longest after multiple collisions.	0.48265173750127094
In addition to a slight influence of the accompanying injuries on the duration of complaints, the individual constitution seems to be an important determining factor.	0.8880498287901132
In order to resolve the difficulties of conducting of this retrospective study, prospective studies are necessary which include documentation of diagnosis, treatment protocols, duration and type of complaints.	0.6377957663477783
Large B-cell neoplasms represent one of the most frequent groups of non-Hodgkin-lymphomas (30-40%).	0.6906021329255552
They are characterised by an aggressive clinical course.	0.4412945862083136
These lymphomas may evolve either de novo or secondary during the course of a less aggressive lymphoma.	0.3981718534365368
In addition to primary nodal, a primary extranodal manifestation is rather common.	0.6738376460402687
The neoplastic cells, even within one given case, show a broad morphological spectrum.	0.6380722955420757
Several findings of the last two decades have revealed that the large B-cell lymphomas represent an inhomogeneous group.	0.7425375159443364
This fact has been taken into account by the new WHO classification of malignant lymphomas.	0.5874312198688694
There are two groups identified, that of the variants and that of the subtypes.	0.8546784883091346
The various variants (centroblastic, immunoblastic, anaplastic, T-cell/histiocyte-rich) correspond to lymphomas without reproducible discriminating criteria lacking characteristic clinical, immunophenotypical and genetic findings.	0.42173802817187367
In contrast, the primary mediastinal, the intravascular, the primary effusion and primary central nervous system lymphomas represent distinct disease entities.	0.6944117709237555
A number of recently described large cell lymphoma types, i. e. plasmablastic, ALK-positive and primary gastric, are included in the classification, their designation as distinct entities is still under discussion.	0.6461355809542337
In the presented study, knee joint proprioception of 43 patients with a patellar pain syndrome of the knee joint was evaluated.	0.764684175352687
In a control group, the proprioception of 30 healthy volunteers with clinical and anamnestic inconspicous knee joints was examined.	0.5710449581252196
We tested the proprioceptive capability of the subjects with a passive angle reproduction test.	0.41872534249978355
Additionally, all knee joints were measured with and without an elastic knee bandage.	0.6313802586192153
The patient group showed significant deterioration of angle reproduction capability (13.2  °  +/-  6.1  °) compared to the control group (7.8  °  +/-  2.8  °).	0.8695968392551996
After applying an elastic knee bandage, the angle reproduction capability significantly improved to 9.2  °  +/-  4.5  °.	0.8525312861583673
Proprioception of the contralateral, noninvolved knee joint in the patients (11.6  °  +/-  6.3  °) was worse compared to the control group.	0.9271789819949823
Applying an elastic knee bandage did not significantly improve the proprioception of the uninjured knee joint.	0.46191829668347484
Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained arrhythmia in men.	0.7565884308354814
It is associated with a two-fold mortality risk and an increased cost for health care providers.	0.6378274484493877
The relative inefficacy and the risks of pharmacologic approaches to atrial fibrillation therapy have contributed to increasing efforts to address atrial fibrillation with curative ablative strategies.	0.4676975919972555
Ablation approaches for atrial fibrillation focus on two alternate strategies: ablation of the substrate for initiation and ablation of the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation.	0.45325841923308424
It has been demonstrated that atrial fibrillation may be initiated by repetitive atrial premature beats originating from a single focus.	0.6872529542281572
These ectopic foci can be mapped and ablated, thereby removing the substrate for initiation of atrial fibrillation.	0.4379523844415152
Most often, these atrial premature beats arise from the pulmonary veins.	0.7110383404967316
A challenge in trying to ablate the trigger is actually having enough spontaneous activity from the said focus throughout the electrophysiologic study.	0.3479194642023434
To sidestep the need of mapping, pure anatomic approaches are currently under investigation to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins from the atrial myocardium by circumferential lesions.	0.4858367547859632
In patients without a defined trigger for atrial fibrillation, efforts were made to ablate the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation.	0.5744626896096415
Strong evidence exists that atrial fibrillation is the result of multiple coexisting reentrant wavelets requiring a critical myocardial mass to perpetuate.	0.4721298503898298
Several working groups demonstrated that intraoperative compartmentalization of the myocardial tissue by surgical incisions or radiofrequency pulses is highly effective in preventing atrial fibrillation.	0.3871059386196658
Currently, attempts were made to reproduce the surgical technique using transveneous, catheter-based approaches.	0.5682864849686007
Though our knowledge of ablation techniques and technical prerequisites is continuously increasing, the difficulty to produce complete linear lesions in the left atrium and local thrombus formation at the ablation line are problems that are still not solved.	0.6364911911912517
Using a time-budget method in a 3 year longitudinal study with a control group design, substantial reductions in the engagement of non-obligatory instrumental, social, and leisure activities could be found in a group of mildly to moderately demented patients.	0.6122908054894141
Controlling these changes for differences in baseline paramters, the dementia-specific reduction was about 1,5 hours compared to a non-psychiatric control group.	0.593874691041096
These clinically relevant changes in activity levels underscore the importance of these activity domains with regard to the development of diagnostically useful indicators at the early stages of dementia.	0.48777550758850907
Time-budget methods seem to be particularly useful to close the diagnostic gap with regard to the assessment of everyday competence indicators especially at early stages of the dementia illness.	0.6174306125156579
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease with different etiological, morphological, functional, clinical and therapeutic aspects.	0.778119048852201
Recent investigations indicate that HCM is considerably widespread in the population (1:500).	0.6148339691356902
The causes seem to generate from familial or sporadic abnormalities (mutations).	0.36325577974944195
Depending on the clinical aspect, the complaints, and on the basis of morphologic and hemodynamic investigational results, we mainly have to consider two types of medical and surgical management.	0.8102992863917979
Atrial fibrillation is in 20-50% the most frequent dysrhythmia after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and a possible cause for hemodynamical complications and prolongation off the medical treatment in patients.	0.842773272731107
Therefore, the effect of -blocking with metoprolol for prevention of supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA) was investigated in a prospective and randomized trial.	0.8506604258313918
200 patients after CABG were randomized in a drug and control group (average age 63.2 years, 154 male, 46 female).	0.5867749426091255
Patients of the drug group (n=100) were treated with metoprolol (1mg/kg/BW) beginning on day one after operation, whereas patients of the control group (n=100) received therapy only in case of occurrence of atrial fibrillaton.	0.7097300079606295
ECG, blood pressure, and electrolyte concentrations were measured regulary until the tenth day after surgery.	0.5959855409973371
Reasons for exclusion were an ejection fraction (< 30%, SA- and AV-block or simultaneous application of epinephrine and metoprolol.	0.6804834044500951
There were no significant differences between the patients of drug and control group with respect to age, sex ejection fraction, previous medication, number and type of bypass grafts, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and perioperative ischemic events.	0.7598231661203156
However, a statistically significant difference was seen in the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias in both groups, 4 patients of the therapy group (4%) in contrast to 37 patients of the control (37%) developed supraventricular arrhythmias during the postoperative observation period (p<0.0001).	0.8890226821876485
Both groups differed in total time of hospital stay by 1.5 days (control group: 9.83 +/- 2.88 days; drug group: 8.42 +/- 2.81 days), which was statistically significant (p<0.05).	0.7140972359822793
All patients of the drug group could be discharged with a stable sinusrhythm, whereas 7 patients of the control group were discharged with persistent atrial fibrillation.	0.7584718858383732
The difference was statistically significant as well (p<0.01).	0.42918539295908664
Neither typical side effects of metoprolol, nor AV-blocks, bradycardia (f<60/min) or symptoms of low blood pressure could be observed.	0.5901617439920835
The conclusion of this trial is a recommendation for a preventive application of 50mg metoprolol/day after coronary artery bypass surgery, which can reduce the incidence of SVA as well as the hospital stay statistically significant.	0.6954680891704732
Especially by using the "Functional Muscular Diagnostics" described by Janda specific muscular imbalances can be found.	0.5158040069152621

Background: Angiotensin converting  enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) alter the function of the renin-angiotensin-aldesterone-system, which regulates the angiotensin II synthesis.	0.5313368359851343
Angiotensine II is known to be a potent vasoconstrictor.	0.7638579546575108
ACE-inhibitors are used as a standard treatment of arterial hypertension concerning the WHO-guidelines.	0.7962913387135677

Evoked potentials (EP) are a valuable tool when assessment of neurocritical care patients is impaired by loss of consciousness and lack of co-operation.	0.6702201650416736
Different modalities of short latency EP can be applied to evaluate sensory, auditory and visual systems.	0.51312923033581
In this review we discuss EP studies in patients with thrombosis of basilar artery, space occupying cerebellar infarction and supratentorial mass lesions of different aetiology.	0.5052509315350305
Paclitaxel, a potent anti-tumor agent, shifts the cytoskeleton equilibrium towards assembly of altered and extraordinarily stable microtubules.	0.4247857676417833
These cellular modifications lead to reduced proliferation, migration, and signal transduction.	0.5731866832787217
It is highly lipophilic, which promotes a rapid cellular uptake, and has a long-lasting effect in the cell due to the structural alteration of the cytoskeleton.	0.9069586966061451
This makes paclitaxel a promising candidate for local drug delivery intended to address the proliferative and migratory processes involved in restenosis.	0.3914277190122542
In this article, results of our in vitro and in vivo studies with paclitaxel are presented.	0.6639453170928915
Cell culture experiments with monocultures of human arterial smooth muscle cells as well as cocultures with human endothelial cells showed that paclitaxel leads to an almost complete growth inhibition within a dose range of 1.0-10.0µmol/l, even after a short (20 min) single dose application.	0.6942361751127396
The comparison of an active, semi-active, and passive delivery system (porous balloon, microporous balloon, and double balloon) favored the double balloon for the following in vivo experiments.	0.623116249364011
Tubulin staining and electron microscopy enabled visualization of paclitaxel-induced vessel wall alterations.	0.3656266564527854
In the rabbit model, locally delivered paclitaxel resulted in reduced neointima formation and enlargement in vessel size; in the pig model, however, after stenting, this inhibition was not significant.	0.5770919814767026
Both reduced proliferation and enlargement in vessel size contribute to a preservation of vessel shape and are likely to be caused by a structural alteration of the cytoskeleton, which is also supported by vascular contraction force experiments.	0.6392384467257559
Atopic eczema is one of the most frequent dermatological diseases, with a still increasing incidence.	0.7731108610344921
Although its etiopathogenesis is still not completely understood, a variety of triggering factors are known.	0.6268917432608654
The following case report describes the clinical course of atopic dermatitis in a 2-year-old boy in whom both IgE-mediated allergic reactions and psychological factors were involved in triggering and maintenance of skin lesions.	0.6753323193047631
This demonstrates how important both dermatological therapy and close cooperation with the field of psychosomatic medicine can be.	0.49605811361629515
Identity development in adolescence may act as stressor triggering juvenile psychotic episodes.	0.2688386442043406
A model is being presented stating that self development in subjects with high vulnerability for psychosis leads to the establishment of an "imaginary self" consisting of phantasies and fictions without taking into account facts and social realities.	0.463612043587701
The "imaginary self" stabilizes irritating self deficiencies, thus leading to a vulnerability for depersonalisation and identity diffusion during actual turmoils of adaptation.	0.4349244871879499
Biomaterials are defined as non-living materials which are used in interaction with biological systems.	0.5108013560302198
Especially in the field of urology, biomaterials are applied in urinary diversion, urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and as cosmetic prostheses.	0.6312666680194118
Biomaterial-tissue interaction is caused by the physical and chemical characteristics of the biomaterial, its degradation, and the resulting protein denaturation.	0.8255530636467635
General requirements include biocompatibility and functionality and the avoidance of carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic, and allergic reactions.	0.4859918735458621
This ist most important when there is permanent contact between urine and epithelial tissue, which may lead to biofilminfection and incrustation.	0.5821963867619085
Continuous modification of known materials, inauguration of new materials, as well as the possibilities of tissue engineering will determine their development in the years to come.	0.6076374520736575
Hitherto the question of an indication for psychoanalytic group psychotherapy has not been clarified sufficiently.	0.6734846698900419
In this paper, under the premise, that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy is a treatment mode in its own right, the issue is investigated which patients might best profit from the group treatment method.	0.6143726375807095
It is pointed out that the group process itself contains a variety of therapeutic treatment factors which cannot be facilitated through psychoanalytic treatment of just one patient.	0.4202255911187333
First, a series of diagnostic, structural, motivational and cognitive indication criteria are discussed.	0.5697673174537559
Second, the moments of a capacity for cohesion and aspects of social relatedness are considered as helpful tools for a formulation of an indication.	0.5280586518666225
As cohesion - according to group treatment outcome research results - has to be viewed as correspondent to the helpful therapeutic alliance, in the context of group psychotherapy, the quest for indication is inextricably linked to patient selection and setting conditions.	0.6646588148665942
The conclusion is that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy, would preferably be indicated for those patients who suffer from constraints of emotional competence as stemming from developmental deficits.	0.4815140927062902
Purpose: To evaluate method- and user effects as well as the required time in the determination of left- and right ventricular ejection fractions in comparing manual and semiautomatic border detection of the endocardium.	0.7530277143675211
The diagnosis of urinary tract infection in renal transplant patients is important because unrecognized bacterial infection may lead - in the worst case - to graft loss.	0.7963149931394652
Between January 1995 and January 1997, we therefore obtained bladder catheter urine samples in 31 female allograft recipients when voided urine samples repeatedly showed pyuria (>=10 WC per microscope field (x40)) and significant bacteriuria (>=;105/ml) combined with vaginal contamination (plenty of squamous epithelial cells, mixed bacterial growth).	0.6132457694792108
Results: In 55 % (17/31), diagnosis of urinary tract infection was confirmed by single bladder catheterization; in 26 % (8/31), urinary tract infection could be excluded, and in 19 % (6/31), bladder colonization without pyuria was found.	0.8569644504767429
Thus, 45 % of the patients with abnormal voided urine samples did not need antimicrobials.	0.825365998255897
After single dose antibiotic therapy with 500 mg Ciprofloxacin, given immediately after catheterization, no infectious complications occurred.	0.542235228361814
Diagnostic single bladder catheterization is a simple, safe and - compared to suprapubic aspiration - barely invasive method for the diagnosis or exclusion of urinary tract infection in female renal transplant patients with higher risk for complications due to an acute bladder infection and non-conclusive voided urine samples.	0.7124782502373386
Most people with the Metabolic Syndrome die from thrombotic complications superimposed to degenerative arterial vascular lesions, mostly myocardial infarction.	0.4439705420200996
Type-2-Diabetes is a risk factor per se for such complications, but often clusters with dyslipoproteinemia, hypertension and obesity.	0.6883933409717202
This is referred to as "Metabolic Syndrome" and often operates on a genetically programmed susceptibility which accelerates the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease in front of a much wider diabetes specific cardiopathy.	0.6230199036605105
From a pathophysiological point of view none of these associated risk factors explains the pathogenetic series of events leading to the precipitation of an occlusive thrombus at sites of complicated coronary plaques.	0.49226845594773794
In patients with the Metabolic Syndrome the coagulation system is switched towards a prethrombotic state, involving increased plasmatic coagulation, diminished fibrinolysis, decreased endothelial thromboresistance and predominantly platelet hyperreactivity ("diabetic thrombocytopathy").	0.5472826134108492
Some of these factors are associated with an increased coronary risk (e.g.	0.6270120816734738
fibrinogen, PAI-1, platelets), but are also directly linked to the pathogenesis of "atherothrombosis".	0.6561604863252084
Altered cardiac remodelling together with adhesion and coagulation mechanisms appears suitable to explain decreased functional performance of infarcted organs, decreased success of acute (reduced fibrinolytic response, no reflow phenomenon) and longterm intervention strategies for vessel patency (PTCA, CABG) in Diabetes.	0.5976307564355788
Glucose adjustment alone will not adequately neutralize these complex mechanisms, but in the situation of myocardial infarction eumetabolization with parenteral glucose-insulin-potassium infusion appears mandatory similar to non-diabetics.	0.581175953435205
On the longterm a multidimensional interventional repertoire is required particularly in patients with the Metabolic Syndrome including antihypertensive, antidyslipoproteinemic and antithrombotic drugs, customized according to the individual patients needs as assessed by early diagnostic measures ("early secondary prevention").	0.6009133223126157
The indication for operative treatment in spondylolisthesis results from pain, progressive sliding and, in up to 60 % of the patients with progressive dislocation, from radicular malfunction.	0.8719658758316773
The posterolateral fusion in situ is a safe procedure, but the deformation remains and in spondyloptosis plastic deformation of the fusion mass can lead to further dislocation.	0.6589523869151265
With the external fixator as an instrument for reduction and the internal fixator for stabilization the reduction of even serious spondyloptosis and the recovery of a normal spine alignement and posture is possible, with an acceptable neurological risk.	0.6972498583041089
Therefore a concept of treatment is suggested, which as a rule is aiming at the anatomical reduction of the dislocated vertrebra beside stabilization and nerveroot decompression.	0.6797228101280645
Depending on the extent of the slip, reduction and stabilization is to be performed in one, two or three stages.	0.9116727825105251
An anterior or posterior fusion is sufficient in grade I dislocation.	0.46307120363593074
In grade II-V a combined posterior and anterior surgical proceedure is recommended.	0.42127766623433954
Objectives: This study was conducted to evaluate a modified technique of interskalene brachial plexus anaesthesia (ISB) and postoperative catheter analgesia for shoulder surgery.	0.7241275171208797
The original method described by Winnie bears some rare but life-threatening complications (inadvertent subarachnoid or intra-arterial injection, pneumothorax).	0.5060126060123108
Objectives: Due to its low solubility and negligible metabolism, desflurane is assumed to be especially suitable for application by low-flow anaesthetic techniques.	0.6238694894889254
The aim of this clinical investigation was the development of a standardised dosing scheme for low-flow and minimal-flow desflurane anaesthesia.	0.7845340429856519
Methods: One hundred six ASA status I-II patients were assigned to six groups according to the duration of the initial high-flow phase, fresh gas flow, and fresh-gas desflurane concentration.	0.7107687076047748
The median age, height, body weight, and constitution of the groups was comparable.	0.6788096295135564
After an initial high-flow phase using 4.4 l/min, the fresh gas flow was reduced to 0.5 l/min (minimal-flow anaesthesia) or 1.0 l/min (low-flow anaesthesia).	0.8301743099101675
Inspired nitrous oxide concentrations were maintained at 60% to 70%.	0.5704058305364696
Using different standardised schemes of vaporizer settings, inspired desflurane concentrations were applied in the range from 3.4% to 8.7%, i.e., between 1 and 1.5 MAC.	0.8045065183330493
Inspired and expired desflurane concentrations were measured continuously by the side-stream technique and recorded on-line.	0.5161406280122707
Venous blood samples were taken immediately prior to induction and 45 min after flow reduction for measurement of carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) concentration).	0.44213952494568903
Results: In the 10- to 15-min initial phase during which a high fresh gas flow of 4.4 l/min was used, the inspired desflurane concentration reached values in the range of 90%-95% of the fresh gas concentration.	0.8273811896092145
In low-flow anaesthesia this concentration could be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting, whereas in minimal-flow anaesthesia with flow reduction the fresh gas concentration had to be increased by 1% to 2%: The quotient calculated by division of the inspired desflurane concentration by its fresh gas concentration (Q=CI/CF) ranges between 0.65 and 0.75 in minimal-flow and between 0.80 and 0.85 in low-flow anaesthesia.	0.7657345794139689
If use was made of the wide output range of the desflurane vaporizer, the inspired concentration could be increased rapidly by about 5% in 8 min, although the flow was kept constant at 0.5 l/min.	0.7131325435532588
Compared with its value prior to induction (2.13 +/- 1.05%), the COHb concentration decreased statistically significantly by about 0.7% during the 1st hour of minimal-flow anaesthesia (1.42 +/- 1.01%).	0.7428274690849556
In no case was a COHb concentration observed that exceeded threatening or even toxic values, although the soda lime was changed routinely only once a week.	0.5024519045816016
Conclusions: The pharmacokinetic properties of desflurane, resulting in especially low individual uptake, and the wide output range of the vaporizer facilitate the use of low-flow anaesthetic techniques in routine clinical practice.	0.6814053511788949
Even in minimal-flow anaesthesia, the duration of the initial high-flow phase can be shortened to min.	0.6352090545397068
If the flow is reduced to 1 l/min, the inspired desflurane concentration achieved in the initial high-flow phase can be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting.	0.6128810227607837
In minimal-flow anaesthesia, however, with flow reduction to 0.5 l/min, the fresh gas concentration has to be increased to a value 1%-2% higher than the inspired nominal value.	0.8053945945809138
Due to the wide dialling range of the desflurane vaporizer, the amount of vapour delivered into the breathing system can be increased to about 110 ml/min even at a flow of 0.5 l/min.	0.6543186953486433
The large amount of agent that can be delivered into the system even under low-flow conditions, together with the very low individual uptake, results in a time-constant that is sufficiently short for the clinically required rapid increase in inspired desflurane concentrations.	0.625571107133547
The short time-constant of low-flow desflurane anaesthesia improves the control of the anaesthetic concentration.	0.7296540344122233
If all measures are taken to safely avoid inadvertent drying out of the soda lime, there is no evidence that low-flow anaesthesia with desflurane is liable to increase the risk of accidental ca	0.6880281113309359
Arterial port systems are frequently used in the adjuvant and palliative therapy of colorectal hepatic metastasis.	0.5770825770648499

Background: Coenesthesias can be defined as disorders of body perception or body hallucinations, projected in different parts of the body.	0.5160080128502041
Patients complain of intractable pain or dysesthesia.	0.27308701413137676
These symptoms are reported even from organs where we usually have no perception.	0.395597511881312
Coenesthesia must be regarded as a symptom that can be observed in various psychiatric diseases, e.g., schizophrenia.	0.613838343043464
However, in rare cases coenesthesias can be documented in neurological diseases, e.g., intracranial tumors or infections.	0.5920029911533973
Therefore, accurate assessment of possible differential diagnoses is important.	0.5694268907922002
In late stages, coenesthesias can easily be recognized because of their "bizarre" character.	0.501989543405668

Studies on the everyday life of the elderly often deal with visible behavior.	0.583230179311907
In this study, the subjective experience of the everyday living environment was investigated, paying special consideration to the role of mobility impairment.	0.658826731058105
Two approaches, one oriented toward the subject's experience of the home environment, another oriented toward the environmental specifics of the individual's favorite place, were employed.	0.6447758633755373
Is the experience of living at home different for individuals with various levelsults were found in the experience of cognitive, biographical, and spatial dimensions of the living environment.	0.6559832984052738
Similarities were found in the experience of emotional, social, and behavioral dimensions of one's home.	0.7183719295472135
Competence loss played an important role in how the subjects experienced living at home, yet even the mobility impaired experienced their home as a environment which could be shaped.	0.5129861568995605
The environment-oriented approach showed that the favorite place of mobility impaired persons was characterized by higher spatial density.	0.5444989328914032
Finally, an examination of four home environment profiles using cluster analysis illustrated the connection between both person- and environment-oriented approaches and offered insights into a transactional perspective of person and environment.	0.5293723362827041
Even though the subjective experience of one's home environment is not easily quantifiable in terms of maintaining everyday competence, it nonetheless imparts meaning to the elderly person's daily life.	0.5497484363040249
The main advantage of the bilateral medial rectus faden operation (posterior fixation suture) for the treatment of essential infantile esotropia is the low occurrence of delayed consecutive exotropia.	0.5599849887188141
Nevertheless, this unwanted complication also occasionally occurs after a faden operation.	0.48617471664057554

Preoperative arthroscopy was performed to document intraarticular lesions.	0.600005336081628
There were 7 reluxations (5 because of a new accident), mostly after Putti-Platt procedures.	0.738314435386166
The average modified Constant Score was 66 (10-85) points (maximum 85).	0.6362207383457283
29 patients (27%) had less than 60 points, mostly because of pain and restriction of function, and were evaluated as poor.	0.7798167583502141
Lesions of rotator cuff, long biceps tendon and subscapularis tendon had a bad prognosis.	0.49217173266697145

Molecular and epidemiological studies have confirmed that human pathogenic papillomaviruses (HPV)types 16 and 18 are causally involved in the developement of carcinoma of the cervix.	0.4797268431613097
This statement is also true, albeit with reservations as yet, of other so-called high-risk HPV types, such as HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56 and 58.	0.6591964652456004
Around 500,000 women throughout the world become ill with carcinoma of the cervix every year, and 1-4% of all younger women have a precancer of the cervix uteri.	0.8138352565109288
This knowledge of the viral origin of anogenital neoplasms has not yet been exploited for primary and secondary prevention of these illnesses, however.	0.678305106238035
This is mainly because infection with genital HPV types is very prevalent in young women but seldom leads to carcinoma.	0.36052446313125364
In this review, therefore, the most important epidemiological data available on cervical carcinoma and its preliminary stages are analysed with reference to an association with HPV.	0.6691772837882629
In addition, the molecular biological data on HPV as it relates to anogenital carcinogenesis are presented.	0.46855320813989165

By using pCPS it is possible to stabilize the patient's hemodynamic situation and to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures if other means of resuscitation do not suffice.	0.6460928869758491
The use of pCPS in resuscitation is indicated in circulatory arrest if further therapeutic options seem promising.	0.4527322185812028
Defects of the frontoorbital complex subsequent to extensive tumor surgery or severe trauma often result in aesthetic and functional disharmonies.	0.4592589201163823
The long-term results of rehabilitation related to different materials and techniques are the subject of this study.	0.8128168471593374
From 1974 to 1996 altogether 127 patients with bony defects of the orbit and/or the skull base underwent surgery.	0.6878421504380445
All patients' data were documented prospectively from 1984 onwards.	0.3611511686775877
The results following reconstruction with autologous calvarian transplants in 52 patients were compared to those of a control group which received iliac bone or PMMA implants.	0.6177700272564685
Eighty-one bony defects (64%) resulted from tumor resection; 37 patients (29%) suffered from the effects of trauma.	0.5944344445449646
In 67 cases (53%) reconstruction was performed primarily, in 51 cases (40%) secondarily.	0.694735559389593
Free or pedicled soft-tissue transplants were necessary in order to separate the orbit and the neurocranium in 26% of the defects.	0.5788311106358003
On the other hand, small, isolated defects of the orbital roof (7%) were left without any reconstructive procedure.	0.759869782661712
Contrary to the iliac bone grafts, the calvarian transplants resisted secondary resorption.	0.5111681210376117
Postoperative infections appeared in two cases; loss of transplants was avoided entirely in the group of calvarian reconstructions in contrast to the alloplasts.	0.604554017117668
The selection of a suitable donor site area and rigid fixation with microplates led to excellent esthetic results even in cases with large defects.	0.5809750515724069
Within inpatient psychotherapy traditionally different therapeutic approaches are combined.	0.4123659406569441
Usually verbal interventions of different orientations and settings (e.g.	0.22522155816120407
individual and group therapy), nonverbal procedures (e.g.	0.33981641953811176

Little is known about the reciprocal interrelation of such combinations.	0.30809342569099923
Along the example of a definite additive combination of psychodynamic and behavioural psychotherapy for agoraphobias and obsessive disorders a rationale for the interrelationship of the different therapeutic components is discussed.	0.49470282958559786
We report an 18-year old woman with surgically proven primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) and normal intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum levels.	0.676905442110424
The reason for this rare biochemical presentation are possible biologically active amino-terminal parathyroid hormone polypeptide fragments not detected by the widely used two-site immunoradiometric parathyroid hormone assay (PTH IRMA).	0.47121076258891587
Diagnosis and therapy of primary hyperparathyroidism therefore should not exclusively rest on the finding of hypercalcemia coupled with an elevated iPTH level.	0.5998942413697079

The goal of this evaluation study is to analyze the effects of a new gerontopsychiatric institution, the gerontopsychiatric center (GC: a combination of a home-based outpatient service, a day-hospital and a consulting office for elderly with mental disorders) on the reorganization process of the treatment system from intramural toward extramural structures, as experts of the government of the FRG have been demanding for a long time.	0.7572952122509851
Based on data of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies two regional catchment areas - the city of Bielefeld (without GC, control region) and the district of Gütersloh (with GC) - are compared and analyzed, whether changes within the gerontopsychiatric system (subsystem A), the system of general medical treatment (subsystem B), or within the elderly care system (subsystem C) occurred.	0.7950439960090222
Concerning subsystem A the results are that the GC has a strong impact on the intended shift from intra- to extramural structures, without selecting patients by diagnosis nor by severity degrees of their mental disorders in extramural treatment facilities.	0.5931830622711547
The home-based outpatient treatment is especially successful for elderly with a functional psychic disorder.	0.5271146247464328
These patients had the highest scores in improvement of psychiatric symptoms as well as in reduction of their self-care deficits within one year Effects of the GC on subsystem B were evident soon after its establishment, for example, by the increasing cooperation between the gerontopsychiatric health services and general hospitals in the region with GC, in which (hospitals) two fifths of all clinical gerontopsychiatric patients with a mental disorder as the main diagnosis (ICD-9) are treated.	0.8064755792776167
An effect of the GC on subsystem C is possibly the fact that in its region the rate of direct transfers of patients from the clinical gerontopsychiatric department into homes for the elderly is significantly lower than in the region without GC.	0.6714347971309066
In the field of psychoneuroimmunology it has become obvious that the immune system is governed by multiple influences from the central nervous system.	0.5081630669385241
One approach to verify these interactions can be seen in stress research.	0.45116432643473936
While the phenomenon of stress-induced changes in immunological processes is widely accepted, more recent studies focus on possible moderators and mechanisms of these responses.	0.590514650494725
Within this research strategy it became evident that catecholamine increases upon stress are of a major importance for the frequently observed mild leukocytosis.	0.49793287116846124
The present study was conducted to investigate whether the often observed stress-induced increases in the number of peripheral lymphocyte subsets depends on the amount of epinephrine or norepinephrine release.	0.6294453905258005
Moreover, the question was addressed whether high or low catecholamine release is related to subjective ratings on discomfort.	0.5210595851883838
Using a "public speaking paradigm" we were able to replicate previous findings of high increases in the absolute number of CD8+ and CD56+ cells in peripheral blood.	0.46006744241189146
Moreover, when dividing subjects into high and low catecholamine responders, the amount of change was significantly larger in catecholamine responders irrespective of whether norepinephrine or epinephrine was used for grouping the subjects.	0.5224331913646287
However, high and low catecholamine responders did not differ with respect to subjective ratings on discomfort.	0.5683769425762437
The data are discussed with respect to underlying mechanisms in catecholamine-induced lymphocyte migration and possible reasons for the mismatch between objective and subjective indicators of stressor efficacy.	0.4436599701270639

He had had uneventful anaesthesia for appendicectomy 14 years earlier: following 600 mg thiopentone, 180 mg suxamethonium and up to 2 vol.% halothane for 20 min had been used and no symptoms of malignant hyperthermia (MH) were recorded.	0.5453913643039022
Following oral premedication with 2 mg flunitrazepam at 7.00 a.m. anaesthesia was induced with a priming dose of atracurium at 8.45 a.m. followed by 0.2 mg fentanyl, 500 mg thiopentone, and 100 mg suxamethonium.	0.6260502135198447
Endotracheal intubation was accomplished easily [9], and the patient was ventilated manually in a semi-closed circle system until spontaneous ventilation resumed.	0.631743392971958
Enflurane (1.5% for 5 min, 1.0% for 10 min, and 0.8% until the diagnosis of MH was suspected) was given in 33% O2/66% N2O.	0.9145660506674524
Seventy minutes after induction it was noted that the spontaneous respiratory rate and minute volume had risen continuously from 10/min and 6 l/min, respectively, to 20/min and 12 l/min.	0.6061721477149566
Attempts at deepening anaesthesia with repeated doses of fentanyl up to a total dose of 0.95 mg failed to reduce the hyperventilation.	0.5673283055255959
In spite of a high fresh gas flow of 6 l/min and assisted manual ventilation, the FIO2 started to fall from 0.34 to 0.28 at 10:20 a.m.	0.6489955224294242
The O2/N2O ratio was changed to 1 : 1, but the FIO2 remained at 0.3.	0.8081113178608703
MH was suspected, enflurane was discontinued, and an arterial blood gas analysis was done (Table 2).	0.7780540716714803
When marked acidosis and hypercarbia were found, dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg was given, the operation was terminated, and the patient's trachea was extubated and he was monitored closely in the intensive care unit for 24 h. Vital signs were stable (Table 3) and no further complications were observed.	0.7784230118714539
The patient did not mention pain or uneasiness postoperatively.	0.31420727610791055
About 6 months later, a muscle biopsy was done according to the European MH Protocol [5] and the patient was found to be MHEh.	0.7722606296690551
In this case five main reasons for the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis must be considered (Table 1).	0.6762557518870368
Firstly, hypoventilation does not seem to be reasonable as the patient was ventilated with 8 to 12 l/min, which is within the range of 80 - 120 mg/kg - min.	0.8369608395320466
Secondly, we can exclude shock and hypoperfusion because the patient had a normal blood pressure and heart rate (within 65 - 90 beats/min), his fingertips and skin were well perfused, his body temperature was 37  °C, and there was no sign of muscle rigidity.	0.6765594261389146
Thirdly, a defect of the CO2 adsorber as well as CO2 admixture to the N2O and O2 ventilation gases can cause hypercarbia.	0.48772261803027916
We use two absorbers in sequence of which one is changed every day, and found neither a change in colour of the indicator nor an abnormally raised temperature of the absorbers [11].	0.5131896527374661
A postoperative check of the ventilator showed no defect in the O2/N2O supply and a correctly functioning anaesthesia apparatus.	0.4223232640321817
A malfunction of both CO2 absorbers resulting in intraoperative hypercarbia could not explain a postoperative mixed acidosis lasting for more than 6 h. Anaesthesias performed at the same time using soda lime from the same canisters were totally uneventful.	0.5901937000431613
It is concluded that the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis were caused by hypermetabolism.	0.445789492791158
A thorough postoperative examination by an internist did not reveal any thyroid, pulmonary, endocrine, or circulatory reason for our intra- and postoperative findings.	0.6989555424418257
Iatrogenic factors like superficial anaesthesia or systemic side effects of adrenaline admixture to local anaesthetics can cause hypermetabolism without striking clinical signs, but they do not cause mixed acidosis lasting longer than 6 h (Table 2).	0.5568015155614879
The most suitable explanation in this case is an abortive form of MH.	0.6891566741181256
Introduction: Avoidance of extracorporeal circulation during beating heart surgery (OP CAB = Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery) for aortocoronary bypass grafting (ACBG) is gaining increasing importance in modern cardiac surgery.	0.6512769683690444
With the development of new mechanical stabilization devices, the revascularization of the posterior wall of the heart and the distal rith coronary artery became feasable.	0.687659237280983
Especially high-risk patients with multiple risk factors for open heart surgery will profit from this approach, because the negative effects of the extracorporeal circulation are avoided.	0.8305362821035299
Although dementia is described as one of the constituent characteristics of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), alongside gait disturbances and urinary incontinence, there is a rather limited number of controlled studies concerning neuropsychological deficits in the disease.	0.6073485097942335
A wide range of psychopathologically relevant symptoms have been described, but the common features of most cases include mental and motor slowing, apathy, emotional indifference, anosognosia, memory and attentional impairment.	0.5527176641249424
A number of other functional deficits such as dyslexia, dysgraphia, acalculia, apraxia can also frequently be found.	0.3550155181224201
Some emphasis is put on the work of J. de Mol (Brussels) which appears to be most important for the study of neuropsychological symptoms in NPH patients.	0.6289471004739604
The methodological standard of a number of studies has been found to be rather low, and yet a sound neuropsychological investigation may be of utmost importance for the diagnosis and neurosurgical outcome assessment.	0.7814674006636609
Concerning morphological correlates of the functional deficits in NPH, various hypotheses have been formulated, but it is argued that symptoms can neither be described as predominantly "diffuse" in nature, nor can they be reduced to unilocular dysfunctions.	0.6771867585486535
Recommendations for future research strategies are formulated.	0.4316867769397276
Up to now there are no published results of therapy of paraphilia (Pedophilia, Sadism) and sexual aggressive impulsiveness with LHRH-(luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) Agonists in the Germanspeaking countries.	0.6083715850255482
In this report we describe 11 patients which were treated with the LHRH-Agonist Leuprolide Acetate in a period of 12 months.	0.6712858846133951
The patients showed no tendency of sexuell aggressive behaviour and reported an evident reduction of penile erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexual deviant impulsiveness and phantasies.	0.4172591040793502
One patient died from suicide.	0.662718213161141
In combination with other treatments LHRH-Agonist seem to be a very promising alternative to cyproterone acetate and its possible carcinogene effects.	0.6206011040700533
Aim of the study: To investigate the long-term effect of TNFR55-IgG1 in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis refractory to multiple previous DMARD treatments.	0.7117861107777705
Methods: Between 1994 and 1995 we recruited 80 patients for two double blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trials.	0.5244588351936165
All patients were treated for 2-30 months with a glycosylated fused protein consisting of two human p55 TNF receptors linked to a human IgG1-Fc.	0.5691637093772794
The dose range was 2.5-100mg/month given i.v.	0.5549960182259439
with cumulative doses from 40-940mg.	0.2572247985136097
All patients were followed-up prospectively for 24-36 months after initiation of therapy.	0.6587328971375563
The evaluations included a 48 swollen and tender joint count, ESR, CRP, RF, ANA, ENA, and safety parameters at 6 month intervals.	0.3764123982892776
In addition, pharmacokinetics, TNF, and anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibody levels were available after the first and third injection.	0.5583149456049749
Results: Data from 80 patients are available representing an experience of more than 170 patient years;  11 patients are still being treated.	0.7495365635267273
Predominant reasons for treatment withdrawal were restrictions in treatment protocol.	0.3167996661860748
Six patients died  (1 during treatment, 5 in the post-treatment follow-up).	0.8545501156648834
All deaths were related to preexisting cardiovascular disease except one post-surgery septic arthritis 6 months after the last dosing (during vacation in another country).	0.4892834238192013
Anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies correlated with a decrease in drug half-time.	0.3685596528435662
Shifts in the TNFR55-IgG1 glycosylation pattern affected pharmacokinetics and efficacy.	0.30234888434839197
A lupus nephritis occurred 18 months after the last dosing in one patient with erosive RA (ANA and dsDNS positive already before TNFR55-IgG1 initiation).	0.49705842142985684
Continued treatment for 3 years in 11 patients resulted in an 81% reduction in swollen joint count, less morning stiffness, less pain, and a reduction in steroids.	0.7950986407472822
Conclusion: Treatment with TNFR55-IgG1 is safe and efficacious over the long-term in patients with severe refractory RA.	0.6199976271647022
For both VFR and as IFR flight, visual assessment is the major source of information for the pilot.	0.5823792132165615
The new possibilities for change of refraction by means of corneal refractive surgery have led to an increasing demand from pilots for these new methods.	0.5072387759256611
Can these methods successfully be applied for aviation purposes?	0.31383775581742773
The valid regulations for medical standards of pilots, as well as the future international regulations such as JAR and ICAO, are explained in this respect.	0.5077624608251735
A report is given on the work of the Advisory Board of the German Federal Government Air Traffic Authority and on the cases treated so far and their outcome, and recommendations are expressed.	0.6517675987403607
Concerning the legal situation and clinical experience, advice for pilots, aviation medical examiners and ophthalmologists is given.	0.37412657126177334
Persistent remnants of the caudal müllerian ducts can manifest in several forms and are often associated with other urogenital disorders, especially hypospadias.	0.5714358072981934
Inadequate activity of the müllerian inhibiting factor, in addition to fetal testosterone deficiency, is responsible for this syndrome.	0.7387846066081923
The etiology, diagnosis and management of müllerian duct remnants are discussed.	0.4587333350773052
A complex case of penile-scrotal hypospadia, hypoplastic prostate gland, testicular ectopia and retrovesical cyst is presented.	0.3164156194492658
The official German guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia were published by the Bundesgesundheitsamt, now called Robert-Koch-Institut, twelve years ago.	0.368210543264475
The recently published official "guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia" of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are categorized according to scientific evidence.	0.44335313816200284
The American guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the official German guidelines.	0.2900952513980966
The purpose of the present paper is to inform the German anaesthesiologist about the official CDC guidelines and to provide a renewed background for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia.	0.665046684976819
At present, the importation into Germany of life-threatening and highly contagious diseases such as pneumonic plague and Ebola is unlikely, but cannot be ruled out.	0.5009699842005471
In spite of the extreme rarity of these diseases, guidelines are necessary to prevent the spread of these agents in case of their importation.	0.711943864174254
In Germany, marked regional differences exist with respect to the development of emergency regulations and the availability of specialized centers for diagnostics and therapy.	0.4583379289167085
A federal framework is missing.	0.13869351417902295
A concept is presented here in which the capacity to respond is substantially augmented with limited additional cost through inter-regional cooperation using existing infrastructure and federally standardized procedures.	0.4099672300103158
The therapeutic effect and the side effects of fumaric acid derivatives used in treatment of psoriasis vulgaris have been subjects of controversy for more than 30 years.	0.6886665739669219
A total of 83 patients with severe psoriasis vulgaris were investigated in as ingle-centre, long-term open (12 months) clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the fumaric acid ester preparations Fumaderm initial and Fumaderm.	0.699930154983509
The antipsoriatic effect of the fumaric acid derivatives was clear, with a mean reduction of 76% in PASI.	0.7907928176409674
Adverse events in were noted in 62% of the patients (mainly flushing and gastrointestinal complaints).	0.6371358435591715
These were dose-dependent and decreased in frequency in the course of the study.	0.7204588894930158
No severe adverse events occurred.	0.2298342413693609
We believe that of fumaric acid derivatives are indicated in cases of severe therapy-resistant psoriasis to and can be used even for long-term application.	0.6820150920030309
Background: Because retinal necrosis syndrome seldom occurs, we present our results of silicone oil tamponade for associated retinal detachment.	0.6758632119679778
The eyelids are the site of many different pathological conditions.	0.47538386880203715
Swelling - often oedematous - is a frequent symptom.	0.9863846728221326
This publication deals with the pathophysiological and anatomical basis of eyelid swelling and mainly provides a practical approach for differential diagnosis with the help of flow and short characterisations of possible causes.	0.5202044981060188
The subjective complaints of the patient charts (pain, pruritus) are shown to be important criteria for orientation.	0.829540134013707
Special interest is focussed on allergic diseases and atrophic conditions as causes of eyelid swelling.	0.3664956788831353
A 74-year-old man suffered from symptoms of a left upper lobe pneumonia.	0.7168251847335871
Additional retrosternal masses were proved.	0.11623552549565935
Progression in the left upper lobe occurred in spite of antibiotic therapy; infiltrations of the right lower lobe were seen.	0.7161445324109041
No germs could be identified.	0.25904767757075314
Bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy showed no pathological findings.	0.27742245313596875
His general health became worse, and the patient died under the clinical diagnosis of "wandering pneumonia" with finally suspicion of fulminant pulmonary artery embolism.	0.831107682862395
Autopsy findings revealed an advanced stage of pulmonary artery sarcoma with myocardial infiltration and metastases in both kidneys and thyroid gland.	0.4759917952433588
General manifestation of pulmonary artery sarcoma usually are symptoms similar to those caused by pulmonary artery embolism with obstruction of pulmonary arterial flow.	0.549255382861516
The unusual constellation of clinical findings similar to colliquating pneumonia results in secondary infection due to tumorous pulmonary infarction.	0.3473038253469782
The difficulties in diagnosis by biopsy are caused by primary intravascular growth of the neoplasms.	0.5485963389874187
Therefore early diagnosis in an operable tumor stage by means of CT, MR, and angiography is very important.	0.6814683097479839
Definition of the problem: Is it the brain that makes a human being a person?	0.445099957007588
This anthropological question has been raised because of the findings of modern human brain research, and there are severe ethical consequences anew: If the appropriate anthropological answer is yes, then all invasive research would be problematic, because one would touch the basis of human essence.	0.6522804973210399
The problem is that the two major philosophical paradigms that offer an answer to the anthropological question, dualism and monism, have opposing concepts.	0.5492464104445925
Arguments: This paper argues that the error of these two paradigms is that they understand the human body and the human mind as 'res' - as things.	0.7711950347525887
The explanation of the human being as an interactive unit of body and mind is impossible in both paradigms.	0.5662984730001434
A third anthropological view that tries to make that understandable is the anthropology of the Hebrew Bible.	0.3098523494463406
It does assume the category 'thing' while speaking about humans, it presumes the category 'aspect'.	0.47326050486231047
There is no Hebrew word for 'mind' in contrast to 'body' or vice versa.	0.42880651890805244
The biblical language only knows terms for the unity of human beings seen under a certain aspect.	0.36815577766122565
Conclusion: Here, the body and thus the brain are important and necessary condition for human essence, but this is not a sufficient explanation for the human personality.	0.7949060394643059
Invasive research on the human brain is here neither generally forbidden nor tolerated - one has to demonstrate in every single case whether the planned operation touches regions that are crucial for the personality of the human subject.	0.6080334382643071
Introduction: In recent studies we identified two morphological phenomena in the facial nucleus of the brainstem that play an important role in the recovery of facial movement: hyperinnervation and misdirected reinnervation.	0.6222298427360806
While the hyperinnervation could easily be quantified by cell counting, the extent of misdirected reinnervation could not be estimated accurately.	0.5017195566161864
In the present study we developed a method for accurate quantification of this misdirected reinnervation.	0.7020720385735575
A 50 year old female patient received anaesthesia of the arm by the vertical infraclavicular blockade of the plexus brachialis (VIP).	0.5525676582111799
Postoperatively an ipsilateral pneumothorax occured complicated by pleural effusion and a contralateral bronchopneumonia, which resolved completely after treatment.	0.4979123429613436
The blockade of the plexus was performed correctly, failures in determining the correct point of needle insertion could be excluded.	0.4975481702142006
Therefore a pneumothorax has to be regarded as a specific complication of the VIP, which might occur despite correct technique, and requires that the patient be informed of this eventuality.	0.7088490686393262
Nevertheless, the VIP is an important method due to its high success rate concerning blockade of the musculocutaneous nerve and tolerance of tourniquet.	0.6953792408957054
The risk of a pneumothorax is about 0.2 to 0.7%.	0.82228490184121
The routine application of ultrasound in pregnancy has had an important impact on perinatal medicine.	0.5155126498275442
New trends in perinatal medicine, aiming at more individual and self-determined pregnancy and delivery, are realizable because of the safety provided by ultrasound.	0.5367326343274305
Often prenatal ultrasound is regarded as only being able to detect fetal malformations, but ultrasound provides many more benefits for a safe pregnancy: early detection of fetal viability; intrauterine localization of the pregnancy; exact determination of the gestational age in early pregnancy; later in pregnancy, confirmation of appropriate fetal growth, position and localization of placenta site.	0.5726124824873084
In addition, the development of close mother-child bonding by visualizing the fetus could be of positive impact.	0.47348806707075486
These aspects are contributions of ultrasound to a gentle and safe pregnancy and delivery for mother and child.	0.4926021283661262
For routine evaluation of ureteropelvic junction obstruction in children, sonography, voiding cystogram, IV pyelogram and a renal scan in combination with administration of furosemide are available.	0.4869761973653181
Furthermore, often preoperative antegrade or retrograde ureteropyelography is performed.	0.4666254561721553
However, the significance of retrograde ureteropyelography in the world literature remains controversial.	0.6193028881646405
Therefore, we reviewed the records of 41 children who underwent a pyeloplasty in our department.	0.728050710269382
In 9 children the ureter was visualized by IV pyelogram, voiding cystogram or antegrade ureteropyelography; a retrograde examination of the ureter was performed in 21 children before pyeloplasty in the OR.	0.5437968563208394
In 11 children the ureter was not visualized preoperatively.	0.3003824766823724
Retrograde ureterography neither gave additional information in any patient nor did it change the operative technique.	0.47779602578378416
In the children where the ureter was not visualized preoperatively, no ureteric abnormality was found in association with ureteropelvic junction obstruction.	0.5675519193723473
Hence, we conclude that retrograde ureteropyelography before pyeloplasty in children is not necessary, provided that sonography does not show ureteral dilatation.	0.6761097360310535
We report on a patient with multicentric juvenile xanthogranuloma, whose unusual clinical and histological pattern initially obscured the diagnosis.	0.5815325606588997
Spontaneous remission of the tumour, which has now been maintained for over 2 years, the change from the primary monomorphological fibrocytic appearance to a polymorphological histiocytic picture with multiple fat-storing giant cells, and the lacking demonstration of specific cell organelles finally allowed the nature of the disease to the definitely diagnosed.	0.7119771504796744
In children with horseshoe kidneys Wilms' tumors can be observed 2 to 8-times more often.	0.5831043894204486
Wilms' tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that seldom show large parts of fatty tissue.	0.36773849345805354
We report about a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms' tumor in a horseshoe kidney which according to radiological criteria could have been a teratoma because of its large lipomatous part with internal calcifications.	0.5941860711011817
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses are presented in different cross-section imagings.	0.48755204692998366
Both differential diagnostic considerations correlated with the histologic diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms'tumor.	0.580493781875478
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technic based on the idea of biological tissue healing.	0.6835862690046235
External gene segments are transferred to cells that overexpress growth factors locally to achieve this effect.	0.3951791628273381
The influence of growth factors on fracture healing is very well documented in the literature.	0.6645174747416381
Experimental data demonstrate that defect healing in bone can be accelerated by the application of different cytokines in vivo.	0.44352936292827555
Gene transfer is a promising, new technic of in situ tissue engineering that will enter clinics within the next decade.	0.6390554485774966
Biomechanical investigations of the mandible are difficult to perform due to a variety of conditions involved.	0.66517376049447
For the appropriate reconstruction of biomechanical properties, a geometrically correct body model has to be established which fits to complex in vivo conditions.	0.6305615863274989
The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of finite-element models (FEM) for the assessment of mandibular deformation under mechanical loading.	0.5855984294297477
Explanted human mandibles (n = 5) were investigated by strain gauges to determine the individual strain distribution under mechanical loading.	0.6343038856889575
FEM analysis based on a computed tomograph (CT) was performed and the results were matched with the test data.	0.7917898789315695
Our study demonstrates only minor interindividual differences in the strain distribution for each load studied.	0.4500377947224149
The mechanical response in terms of deformation was found to depend mainly on gross geometrical properties and to a minor extent on the various other variables.	0.5476768001807119
At all positions the maximum principal strain was tensile, the minimum principal strain was compressive, and the absolute strain values were correlated with the magnitude of the applied force.	0.6491695535683956
CT-based FEM analysis revealed the utility of mathematical models to approximate simulated data our experimental results.	0.34277789338852993
Hence, FEM analysis is a non-invasive tool in the prediction of biomechanical behaviour of individual mandibles and therefore may help in trauma reconstruction and treatment planning.	0.6156273604757003
Acrodysostosis is a rare syndrome characterized by growth retardation and peripheral dysostosis.	0.5595194325850903
70% of affected patients exhibit mental retardation.	0.6444313891785739
Inheritance occurs in an autosomal-dominant pattern.	0.4948463721631364
The genetic defect is not known.	0.5215879688236795
Therapeutic strategies in the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma are based on the high number of non-resectable cancers, the high relative radioresistance and the high distant metastases rate.	0.7181806231723412
Even in curatively resected carcinomas, a locally effective treatment modality is needed because of the risk of microscopical residual disease in the peripancreatic tissue.	0.5545606392834993
The efficacy of radiotherapy is dose dependent.	0.368728407432704
Based on an analysis of published data a dose of more than 50 Gy is recommended, resulting in a high morbidity rate with external beam radiotherapy alone.	0.7445760613607663
The use of intraoperative radiotherapy allows locally restricted dose escalation without increased perioperative morbidity.	0.3917908330291157
In adjuvant and in primary treatment, local tumor contol was improved (70-90 %).	0.6205610771924218
With palliative intent, pain relief was obtained rapidly in over 60 % of patients and led to improved patient performance.	0.8036716337625254
As a result of the high distant metastases rate, even in curatively resected carcinomas, the overall prognosis could not be significantly improved.	0.8100459618325345
Further dose escalation is limited by the increasing incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (20-30 %).	0.6237083789696654
Malignant tumors of the head and neck region are amongst the six most often occurring tumors of the body.	0.6066425497921273
They can be associated with the different anatomical compartments as well as different histologic types.	0.6606122069105431
The way of tumor spread of these malignancies depends on their histologic type and on the region.	0.5949522705893304
These compartments can be separated into the nasopharynx, the oropharynx, and the hypopharynx.	0.7174734414896431
Most of the malignant tumors belong to the squamous cell carcinomas, other histologic types are depicted less frequently.	0.6299111944350383
The histologic types of the other groups which are seen more often comprise of lymphomas and adenoidcystic carcinomas.	0.5243989049121388
The undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx is supposed to be a special type of tumor.	0.6322152084113253
The malignant tumors of the pharynx can also involve all three compartments.	0.5227772332669922
Beside these tumors, malignancies of mesenchymal origin can also be delineated.	0.3915986104642656
While there are quite a number of reports on vascular injuries complicating hip arthropasty by acetabular component screw fixation, retractor tip pressure or extruding bone cement, the incidence of deep femoral vessel injuries in operative fixation of proximal femoral fractures is comparatively seldom described.	0.4949447327310532
We report on two patients with per- and subtrochanteric femoral fractures who sustained injuries of deep femoral artery branches during the implantation of a dynamic hip screw (DHS) and a dynamic condylar screw (DCS), which resulted in a massive thigh hematoma and a fist-size pseudoaneurysm respectively and necessitated surgical intervention in either case.	0.6710819466119738
We blame these vascular injuries on the pressure of Hohmann retractors exposing the femoral bone or on the drilling of boreholes for plate attachement.	0.3985395669532632
After discussing various operative procedures, we conclude that intramedullar implants are safer than plates with regard to potential vascular complications.	0.45773225291833186
Cleft lip and palates (CLP) are caused by a variety of factors.	0.5745796418355111
Ionizing radiation is only one of these factors.	0.6879589549322851
The meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl on April 26, 1986, and the subsequent radioactive fallout did not cause any acute radiation sickness in Germany.	0.5487594657270819
Nevertheless, in West Berlin a significant increase of trisomy-21 cases was reported in births 9 months after the Chernobyl reactor accident.	0.682406106560464
In our study we analyzed the influence of the radioactive fallout after the Chernobyl disaster on the rate and regional distribution of CLP newborns in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR).	0.6112954563675065
In contrast to the Federal Republic of Germany an ongoing malformation register for CLP newborns had existed in the former GDR since 4 July 1967.	0.46038643172909466
Environmental data were collected from national and international environmental authorities and atomic energy agencies.	0.4272348932720016
Population statistics were taken from the statistical yearbook of the former GDR.	0.4933206531590909
During a 10-year period from 1980 to 1989, the average number of CLP newborns in the GDR was 1.88 per 1,000 live births.	0.7085584540018898
A significant prevalence increase was recorded in 1983, 1987 und 1988.	0.40269353337417796
In comparison to the mean rate in the period from 1980 until 1986, 1987 demonstrated an increase of 9.4%.	0.74347769088826
Regional prevalence increases were seen in the three northern districts of Schwerin, Rostock and Neubrandenburg, where the radioactivity measurements in general showed higher levels of the radionuclides caesium-137 und strontium-90 than in other districts.	0.5215629989872663
Owing to the comprehensive malformation register for CLP patients in the GDR, this is the first study for Germany, analyzing the CLP rate before and after the fallout in Chernobyl.	0.6933289297976493
The results support the allegation of the influence of radiation-induced increase of CLP newborns after the Chernobyl reactor accident.	0.43791818125883475
The median survival time for patients with disseminated malignant melanoma is 5-7 months; it is still not really known whether therapeutic measures prolong survival.	0.7372643299568404
The aim of the present investigation was to identify patients with prolonged survival in stage IV disease and to analyse the possible impact of therapy on the course of the disease.	0.7526103595941476
in the Department of Dermatology, Benjamin Franklin University Medical Centre at the Free University of Berlin, 263 patients with were diagnosed as having stage IV melanoma and enrolled in a computer-based registry between 1970 and 1993.	0.44937307678812544
In 89 cases systemic medical mentous treatment was given and 111 patients underwent surgery and/or radiation therapy.	0.5262678290307894
There were 48 patients who received both systemic and local therapy.	0.6381585483839797
On the other hand, 111 patients received no treatment.	0.32374133660983734
Twenty two patients were identified survived longer than 24 months (median survival time 33 months).	0.7314955947042625
None of the patients who had received no treatment survived for 2 years or longer.	0.8823293648931699
The 22 patients with prolonged survival were treated by multimodality included 16 who had received both systemic treatment and surgery and/or radiation, while 3 had had only systemic drug therapy and another 3, only local treatment.	0.71402702045852
Twelve of the 22 patients became tumour free after their initial surgery or radiation.	0.401581862039745
Active therapy in disseminated melanoma with reduction of tumour mass by surgery and radiation and with systemic medical treatment may lead to prolonged survival in a considerable percentage of patients.	0.5421583695063931
Background: The use of intravenous heparin is essential for the treatment of unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction.	0.7235286276757877
A significant rebound of thrombin generation within 6 to 10 hours after termination of heparin infusion has been reported.	0.45971778618443737
This time window is clinically critical as the incidence of recurrent ischemia peaks in this period.	0.4648556913614171
It has therefore been recommended to gradually taper heparin infusion continously rather than to discontinue it abruptly.	0.46009098230804096
However, it is not known which dosing procedure is useful and whether it definitly reduces thrombin rebound.	0.6457975059939262
The use of porcine skin as a biomedical model for the human integument is discussed with reference to the literature.	0.6490101480928224
The epidermis and dermis can be used as a model as there are clear structural, functional and biochemical similarities with human skin layers.	0.5969111391393429
The actual utilization of porcine skin in dermatological research is reviewed.	0.3737072858243717
Practical difficulties are emphasized: in particular, the conditions required for use of porcine skin in experimental research, the most suitable breeds, and restrictions on biological interpretation of the results.	0.7723995252948582
Laparoscopic procedures have attained increasing importance in the diagnosis and therapy of carcinoma of the cervix in recent years (Table 1) [34].	0.9004112509449372
Laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortal lymphadenectomies are therefore performed to assess the operability of carcinoma of the cervix and for its staging.	0.5295094091546306
In the case of primarily operable tumours, paraortal and pelvic lymphadenectomy is carried out by a laparoscopic procedure, and when the lymph nodes are negative nodes and there is no intra-abdominal metastasis the lymphadenectomy is combined with laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy.	0.6583420535125678
If laparoscopy discloses positive lymph nodes, debulking can be carried out and the patient can be referred for radiotherapy.	0.4942323050286067
In addition, laparoscopic procedures, even in combination with radical cervicectomy for early invasive carcinoma of the cervix, can mean conservation of the patient's fertility.	0.7426197655244551
In the case of primarily inoperable tumours laparoscopy can be used to assess the lymph node status and the intra-abdominal tumour spread and to classify the patient's condition as potentially secondarily operable or inoperable.	0.7262185123627715
In addition, in the case of primarily undertreated patients whose carcinoma of the cervix has been diagnosed incidentally in preparations of tissue examined following hysterectomy, posttreatment in the form of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy and laparoscopically assisted colpectomy can be performed.	0.5577911163180658
The efficacy of buprenorphine in opioid dependent patients (n=20) was compared to methadone maintained subjects (n=20) in a randomized comparison trial.	0.7478257184672454
Sublingual application of buprenorphine as an alternative synthetical opioid is being compared to methadone during a 24 week study period.	0.4696634576250394
A trend (p=0.06) could be found in the retention rate of investigated patients being maintained on a mean dosage of 63 mg oral applicable methadone (racemat of L- and D-methadone) in comparison to the group on a mean dosage of 7,3 mg buprenorphine (sublingual tablets).	0.6113225035207237
The dropout-rate of 11 subjects at the end of the study in the buprenorphine group was higher when compared to the dropout-rate of 5 in the methadone group.	0.6430160876347113
There was no significant difference between the two groups over the treatment period in respect to additional consumption of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine as evaluated through urine toxicology.	0.5042946036183289
The result in regard to compliance over the study period demonstrates that methadone appears to be the more successful oral opioid (p=0,04).	0.6495280051994794
Nevertheless, efficacy of buprenorphine in maintenance could be demonstrated in the remaining subjects, and further studies with higher daily doses and a higher number of subjects have to be performed.	0.8004042425999053
In patients with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, surgery is a technically difficult procedure.	0.6216212760316837
Whereas those rare forms of localized pleural mesotheliomy are being detected incidentally and can be cured by complete resection, most patients with diffuse malignant mesothelioma present with an advanced stage of disease.	0.5992836518340806
Most of these patients survive less than 12 months irrespective of the treatment modality.	0.8345195256751192
For diffuse pleural mesothelioma, some favorable prognostic factors were identified: IMIG (International Mesothelioma Interest Group), stages I and II, epithelial type, age under 50, female gender.	0.601330619889612
In IMIG stages I and II, extended pleuropneumonectomy followed by chemo- and/or radiotherapy is recommended.	0.4920037561418114
For this subset of patients, a median survival time of between 20 and 30 months is reported.	0.6592579115223764
Pleurectomy and decortication are recommended as palliative surgical strategies against pleural effusion.	0.34083748004179226
In patients with technically inoperable infiltration of the thoracic wall, irradiation is helpful; sometimes partial remission and relief of pain can be achieved by chemotherapy.	0.6024648917063502
Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) registers the magnetic field generated by the fetal heart.	0.33976816439417995
In contrast to the fetal elctrocardiogram, fECG permits non-invasive registration of fetal heart activity and documentation of all parts of the PQRST-wave-forms from the second trimenon onwards.	0.5482576239879963
This facilitates the determination of cardiac time intervals and establishment of reference values for different stages of pregnancy.	0.4893631514423769
We examined 53 women in 104 recordings from the 10th week of gestation onwards (1 to 10 recordings per individual).	0.5543988658768102
The fMCG (37 magnetic channels, sampling rate 1024 Hz, bandwidth 1-200Hz) was recorded non-invasively over the mother's abdomen in a magnetically shielded room.	0.4882897394319587
Registration of fetal heart beats was generally successful from the 20/21th week of gestation onwards.	0.48986086372794957
In a few cases, fetal heart beats could be registered as early as in the 16th week.	0.7121661004765895
Cardiac time intervals and amplitudes of fMCG increased concordantly with fetal growth.	0.2776761153681547
Mean P wave duration increased from 31 to 49 ms (p < 0.05), PQ interval from 95 to 107 ms (n. s.) and QRS duration from 36 to 52 ms (p < 0.01).	0.5123909002706518
The mean amplitudes of the P and R waves also increased.	0.37830091736969984

The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the complications of our arthroscopic procedures at the ankle joint.	0.6932961458145027
In all patients we evaluated the treatment protocols and in 111 patients (79,3%) we also evaluated the clinical and radiologic results.	0.7879949944012812
All in all we have found complications in 14 patients.	0.41721603601380725
In 4 cases we have seen a delayed wound healing, in 2 cases a superficial infection, in 3 cases a deep infection, in 3 cases a neural damage and in 2 cases a phlebothrombosis.	0.8698486858925878
Our study show, that the complication rate could be minimized by detailed knowledge of the anatomy, exact preoperative diagnostic and planing of the operation and careful preparation of the portals.	0.7343433236212471
The use of a laser also shows a tendency to a lower complication rate.	0.6666554403126521
Airbag inflation is associated with a loud noise.	0.446508010319315
This very short noise has a peak amplitude of 170 dB sound pressure level and can make otologic injuries.	0.3680223801911859
We report a case of acoustic trauma after airbag inflation.	0.49774566678536925
The 24-year-old man has hearing loss both side in the 3000- to 6000-Hz range and in the deep-frequency.	0.6547726555680117
The possibility of acoustic trauma from airbag noise are probably much more common and need more attention in the clinic.	0.49419009705949146
The incidence of primary malignant neoplasms of the pleura, the pericardium and the peritoneum in Germany has been rising since about the mid-1980 s. A continuing rise is expected until about 2020, predominantly due to the peak of asbestos processing in Germany between 1965 and 1980.	0.5697642008716437
About 90 % of the mesotheliomas stored in the files of the German Mesothelioma Registry in Bochum are asbestos related and therefore possibly due to occupational exposure that may be compensated by the professional associations.	0.5620928911019437
More than 500 mesotheliomas annually can be diagnosed in the German Mesothelioma Registry.	0.7412441940234153
In this first part of the series on mesotheliomas, current concepts on etiology and pathogenesis as well as diagnostic procedures and standards are discussed.	0.6520551174907793
At the present, specific chromosomal or genetic defects that constantly give rise to a mesothelioma are not known.	0.5643685400083684
The initiation and progression of malignant mesotheliomas is a highly complex mechanism that is based on individual genetic alterations.	0.4956256500346791
A reliable diagnosis is the basis for therapeutic, prognostic and medicolegal conseques; in general, it can be achieved by thoracoscopic inspection with selected biopsy.	0.7669596192578143
Surgery may gain a more important role in the therapy of malignant tumors of serosal membranes not only in palliative, but also in potential curative approaches if the diagnosis can be made at earlier tumor stages.	0.7837896420686131
Acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a life threatening disease with a mortality rate of 10%.	0.7735350135380724
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs more frequent (85%) and more severe compared to lower gastrointestinal bleeding.	0.6668835846993356
The medical history may be helpful in the diagnosis of the bleeding source.	0.8555914632772306
Prognosis and mortality are dependent on intensity of bleeding, reflected by clinical signs such as shock, hemoglobin level, transfused blood units, hematemesis, presence of comorbidity and age of the patient.	0.5865832093361293
Furthermore rebleeding is associated with an increased mortality.	0.6977447081495725
Therefore one major goal in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding is to avoid rebleeding.	0.4872885153887104
Joints are innervated by nociceptive nerve fibres (nociceptors), which are only activated by tissue-damaging stimuli.	0.5649986350882998
This activation causes pain in conscious humans.	0.22361104250634734
The sensory terminals of many nociceptors in the tissue are sensitized by inflammatory processes.	0.38508929134086445
Under these conditions, normally innocuous and non-painful stimuli are sufficient to activate nociceptors and to elicit pain.	0.39610463008635044
The effect of inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin and prostaglandins is important for the process of sensitization.	0.5255279078598881
In addition to their sensory function, many nociceptors have an efferent function.	0.6275442043077942
They evoke a neurogenic inflammation by the release of neuropeptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide into the tissue.	0.3683895563205404
The efferent function of nociceptors contributes to the generation of inflammatory lesions of the tissue.	0.5028896806810075
Autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogeneic bone (AAA bone) is prepared from cortical bones of human organ donors.	0.4812657313092166
AAA bone possesses osteoinductive properties as it delivers BMPs from its bone matrix.	0.27724315356556145
Within a prospective study, 37 cranial defects were reconstructed using AAA bone implants over a period of more than 7 years.	0.597159844118569
The patients were followed-up at standardized intervals.	0.7343681779847759
Roentgenographic assessments and bone scintigraphies revealed osseous integration and remodelling of the AAA bone implants.	0.3412353336687797
In one quarter of the cases re-entry was performed 10 to 18 months after the cranioplasty (removal of osteosynthesis material, recurrence of tumor).	0.6180702911402496
All nine AAA bone reconstructions showed bleeding surfaces and bony integrations.	0.2647840593555527
A bone biopsy was taken from the center of one of these AAA bone implants and this showed new bone formation originating from the surface of the implant.	0.6724950541780362
In one case an AAA bone implant was lost due to infection.	0.46475308341407295
This is noteworthy as in approximately one third of the cases the bone implants were in direct contact with the frontal sinus.	0.7203717858966714
The clinical results clearly emphasize the therapeutical benefit of AAA bone for cranioplasties.	0.4516334483524282
Large AAA bone chips from human skull bones facilitate the reconstruction of the skull's convexity, especially when sterolithography-based operation planning is performed.	0.5517609382546337
Saphenous vein harvesting remains a 20 % source of morbidity in patients who require lower extremity bypass or coronary artery bypass grafting.	0.601571005029016
In an attempt to reduce the complications associated with this procedure, minimally invasive video-assisted vein harvesting is propagated.	0.5255732066757492
The technique uses currently available endoscopic equipment with mechanical retraction to dissect the great saphenous vein with two limited incisions.	0.33795317259781876
The dissection is visualized on the video monitor to isolate and control side branches by clips.	0.31353945644795717
The vein is removed for reverse arterial bypass grafting or dissection is completed for an in situ bypass procedure.	0.4797371697092537
Initial experience with ten patients undergoing peripheral bypass procedures showed a mean vein-preparation time of 60 min.	0.4067321531823304
Two of seven in situ bypass procedures were complicated by side branch damage controlled through longer skin incision.	0.3878060876468765
After a mean follow-up of 12 months, all bypasses are patent.	0.7943297163888772
Taking our own experience as well as that reported in the literature into consideration, aspects of cost-effectiveness are discussed.	0.6695054560342958
Obstructions of the nasolacrimal duct occur frequently (70%) in term newborns and are symptomatic in 6%.	0.6112347580527387
The reason is an incomplete canalization and differentiation of the lacrimal duct during the fetal period.	0.5795339670821127
A persisting membran between the duct and the nasal cavity at the level of the valve of Hasner in combination with a proximal valvelike obstruction at the junction of the lacrimal canal and sac may cause a dacryocystocele by fluid accumulation.	0.537930291542852
We describe a term newborn with a bilateral dacryocystocele and respiratory distress.	0.4597428568478574
The recognition of a medical discipline on a European level as an independent specialty depends on its registration in the medical directives of the European Union.	0.5812607857917174
With supreme effort, the oral and maxillofacial surgeons of the EU reached this goal in 1989.	0.5927645902374189
The UEMS - Section of Stomatology and Oromaxillofacial Surgery - became the forum for discussion of the relevant problems with representatives of the member states and officials of the European Commission.	0.5331531747254024

It has been demonstrated that in appropriate cases breastpreserving resection is comparable to mastectomy with respect to overall survival.	0.6012957134756797
Up to now it is not quite clear if sentinel node sampling is equivalent to routine lymphadenectomy.	0.5568293088568518
Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy breastpreservation rate is significantly higher, but survival is not significantly increased.	0.6421706087987401
Introduction and Methods: A 0.5 T open-configuration MR system allows free access to the patient via a 58-cm-wide opening on both sides of the machine.	0.6718874223987031
A newly developed system for needle guidance enables the examiner to perform biopsies in combination with real-time imaging and to position laser fibers in the human body.	0.5455005038951857
For imaging, a 2D gradient echo sequence is used (TR 19 ms, TE 9 ms, flip angle 30  °, FOV 24 x 24 cm, slice thickness 10 mm matrix 256 x 128).	0.47634133749973123
The acquired images are displayed on two LCD screens localized within the MR system, thus allowing an interactive needle guidance.	0.4857971309905449
This procedure is illustrated by a case report.	0.6857616773879224
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are established drugs for the treatment of patients with heart failure and hypertension.	0.5140897634303391
There is mounting evidence to suggest that ACE inhibitors may be used for different indications as well.	0.5415258407485942
The rational for the use of ACE inhibitors is to block the vasoconstrictive effects mediated by angiotensin II.	0.428723384639426
The hemodynamic profile of ACE inhibitors is modified by additional effects such as interference with the degredation of bradykinin and accumulation of prostaglandin and nitric oxide (NO).	0.39655155163667544
Thus ACE inhibitors may be successful in preventing the negative effects of vasoconstriction on regional circulation.	0.45284895978404466
Since vasoconstriction, particularly of the mesenteric vasculature appears to be largely mediated by the renin-angiotensin-axis, ACE inhibitors are assumed to be effective in treating or avoiding gut mucosal hypoperfusion.	0.5291755537164008
The critically ill intensive care patient at risk of developing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is still a major therapeutic challenge.	0.7294391188677893
Intravenous preparations of ACE inhibitors may broaden our therapeutic armamentarium for these patients.	0.4628746574678702
However, several questions about the exact mechanisms of ACE inhibitors, such as the ideal substance and the optimal dose, are still open.	0.7824895823290329
Moreover, further work needs to be done to definitely determine whether ACE inhibitors may be helpful to prevent or treat (micro-) circulatory catastrophe in these patients.	0.6389406869951444
The pharmacologic properties of ACE inhibitors provide an exciting stepping stone for future research in this field.	0.48420515719163976
Hypoparathyroidism (HP) results from deficient parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, pseudohypoparathyreoidism (PHP) results form decreased PTH action on its target organs.	0.4319476486257376
Between May 1996 and 1999, a total of 186 endoscopic spinal operations were performed to treat unstable injuries and pathologic fractures.	0.5917747440212154
The operative spinal interventions followed the classic sequence of excision of part of a vertebral body, partial replacement of the vertebral body with bone harvested from the iliac crest, and implantation of a titanium plate to stabilize the part to be fused.	0.6362102438741293
In 62% of these cases we performed primary dorsal straightening with a fixateur interne.	0.8248096396519708
The serious complications were aortic leakage and deep infection in the area of the graft and the implant, each of which occurred in 1 case.	0.7191008927134392
Comparisons with the literature showed approximately the same rate of spinal complications as with open surgery, while the rate of morbidity connected with the surgical approach was reduced to a third in the patient population treated endoscopically, with correspondingly positive implications for the postoperative analgesic requirement and for convalescence.	0.7609649209551516
Various risk scores have been developed for the assessment of operative risk in cardiac surgery.	0.6673117345270374
Although risk stratification has been acknowledged as a useful tool to analyze trends in therapy and changes in patient populations, its relevance in assessing the indication for surgery has been questioned.	0.6863448060352807
It was the goal of this prospective study to compare 6 common risk scores with regard to the predictive value for mortality in individual patients.	0.7047299624242456
Between September 1998 and February 1999 all adult patients undergoing heart surgery were prospectively scored according to the following scores: initial Parsonnet, Cleveland Clinic, French, Euro, Pons, and the Ontario Province Risk score.	0.5393405325370565
Early lethality was assessed within 30 days postoperatively.	0.2823340058534276
Follow-up was completed in 504 patients.	0.6453625228500419
With the exception of the Ontario Province Risk score, lethality in the high risk group was overestimated by all scores, whereas lethality in low to moderate risk groups was underestimated by several scores.	0.6190168980186584
Mean scores of surviving and deceased patients showed a broad overlap with high standard deviations.	0.44784181048506483
Preoperative risk scores are effective tools for stratification of patient populations and the analysis of surgical outcome.	0.43767926875811447
With the aid of risk scores, operative risk can be sufficiently predicted for patient populations or subpopulations.	0.6051629023000636
The Euro score best predicted the outcome of our patients.	0.5280091247071027
However, when the indication for surgery is to be determined in an individual patient, risk scores should be only considered as an orientation in the decision process.	0.8969266754050368
Background and objective: A complicated course of erysipelas is not uncommon.	0.5227682337112901
Bullous, haemorrhagic, necrotic and purulent lesions may be encountered.	0.3012357806421327
Today no reliable data exist as to which constitutional factors renders a patient at risk for developing complicated erysipelas though several risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, are often suggested.	0.561766513263721
Based on the analysis of patients with erysipelas at the Department of Dermatology in Graz, factors determining the risk for complicated erysipelas should be identified.	0.7155893784501638
Patients/Methods: In a retrospective case-control study clinical data sheets of 766 in- patients treated at the department were evaluated with respect to the course of the erysipelas and with respect to potential risk factors.	0.7805160850268532
Results: General risk factors for local complications were location at the lower extremities, pre-existing hepatic or renal disease, hyperuricaemia, and diabetes mellitus.	0.6844418921368148
Hepatic and renal disease and - to a lesser extent - diabetes particularly predisposed for bullous and haemorrhagic lesions, while vascular occlusive disease enhanced the risk for ne- crotic lesions.	0.661218434097522
Conclusions: Location and hepatic and renal disease are the most important risk factors, while diabetes is probably of less significance than previously suggested.	0.7012799928825595
Patients with end-stage liver disease frequently develop combined coagulopathies due to increased procoagulant and fibrinolytic turnover as well as thrombocytopenia.	0.45205505522594125
The onset of clinical symptoms of a haemorrhagic diathesis requires balanced substitution of coagulation factors, since fresh frozen plasma alone does not always maintain a sufficient haemostatic potential in these patients.	0.572358875247265
This substitution commonly follows standard rules based on the assumption that 0.5 - 1 IU of a coagulation factor or inhibitor concentrate given per kg body weight will increase its endogenous activity by 1%.	0.6008943645213838
We set out to investigate the validity of this standard regime in patients with end-stage liver disease scheduled for orthotopic liver transplantation.	0.5423021092807311
Fifty-one adult patients were prospectively studied.	0.477476940306249
In 37 patients with antithrombin III (AT III) activity <70%, an AT III preparation (Kybernin, Behring, Marburg, Germany) was given preoperatively (mean dose 2616 +/- 207 IU) following standard calculations in order to increase endogenous activity to 80%.	0.6615928132792057
Twenty-seven of the patients had chronic hepatic failure (CHF group) with histologically proven cirrhosis and 10 had acute hepatic failure (AHF group).	0.7197229389277627
Blood samples were drawn prior to a 15-min infusion of AT III concentrate and 30 min thereafter.	0.6391174983694665
In 14 patients with prothrombin time (PT) <40%, AT III levels had been corrected earlier during the clinical course to achieve activities >70%.	0.7335844568577514
Prothrombin complex (PPSB, Beriplex, Behring, Marburg, Germany) was substituted (mean dose 2304 +/- 289 IU) to increase procoagulant activity to PT >60%.	0.5819526620349971
Blood samples were drawn in the same fashion as in the AT III group.	0.7189469385146441
The amounts of AT III and PPSB concentrates ( AT III, [IU/kg];  PPSB [IU/kg]) required to increase AT III activity and PT, respectively, by 1% were calculated.	0.8656679036751523
Standard calculations for AT III substitution indicated AT III recovery in all 37 patients who received AT III concentrate.	0.5270684153327692
However, there was a statistically significant difference between patients with CLF and ALF.	0.8521588841898766
In patients with CLF,  AT III was found to be 0.8 IU/kg ( +/- 0.1 SEM) and in those with ALF it was 1.5 IU/kg ( +/- 0.1 SEM) (P<0.05,  t-test).	0.8718394623310837
In patients treated with PPSB concentrate,  PPSB was 1.6 U/kg ( +/- 0.2 SEM) for both CLF and ALF groups.	0.8074860729739846
In patients with end stage liver disease standard rules for substitution with AT III-concentrate are adequate only for patients with CLF.	0.6139192436852844
In patients with ALF higher AT III doses are required to achieve the expected effect on endogenous AT III activity.	0.5761278468974469
Procoagulant activity, as reflected by PT, can be increased by 1% when 1.6 IU/kg PPSB concentrate is given.	0.7158999982590151
However, this study shows the effects of coagulation concentrates only 30 min after administration.	0.7827583008650191
An increased volume of distribution and increased turnover may explain the poor recovery of AT III activity in the ALF group, indicating that the dose of coagulation concentrate should be estimated against the background of the patient's clinical symptoms and diagnosis.	0.723723485116014
Fatigue is a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis.	0.7576657028148756
Rapid exhaustion and reduced exercise tolerance leads to difficulties in maintaining a normal daily life for many patients.	0.3240114659072785
Regular resting and short breaks can help to compensate this to a  certain degree.	0.4426753612121476
A sixteen year old girl with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis suffered two episodes of toxic shock syndrome within a short period of time.	0.5542796538188873
Both occasions were associated with menstruation.	0.24358077857980173
Mycoplasma hominis was isolated in the tracheal secretions once.	0.3772448185030072
Discussion: The etiology of the toxic shock syndrome has been extensively described.	0.6044136391454935
The toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 acts as a superantigen in toxic shock syndrome and interestingly a similar mechanism is discussed in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.	0.4905284792310617
This case report demonstrates the possibility of a close relationship between toxic shock syndrome and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and raises the suspicion of a similar immunopathogenetic process.	0.6327836704184596
Porokeratos of Mibelli is a rare inherited disorder of epidermal keratinization, whose pathogenesis is not fully understood.	0.5701147544983284
The common clinical feature is a erythematous plaque surrounded by a hyperkeratotic border.	0.4129697709821665
The histopathologic hallmark is a parakeratotic cornoid lamella.	0.2527081698603428
An unusual case of porokeratosis gigantea, a morphological variant of classical porokeratosis of Mibelli, is reported.	0.5450766927549178
The pathogenesis, taking in account especially the clonal hypothesis and premalignant nature of porokeratosis, is discussed.	0.5039602826271875
With the introduction of the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics zopiclone and zolpidem it was expected to have hypnotics without side effects and risks characteristically seen with benzodiazepines.	0.5254578965410349
We report two cases with high-dose usage and dependency of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	0.5684975831062613
Both patients were prescribed the drugs to treat sleep disturbances occuring during a depressive episode.	0.45788899812839445
While one patient had a polysubstance abuse there was no evidence for an abuse history in the other patient.	0.681002107028105
To reduce withdrawal symptoms long-acting benzodiazepines were given to both patients.	0.41707460155746834
Thus, it seems that not only patients with a history of substance abuse but also patients with a psychiatric disorder are at risk for abuse of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	0.7746349349101813
Considering the increasing number of case reports with abuse and dependence of zopiclone and zolpidem it seems necessary to reevaluate the dependency risk of the currently available non-benzodiazepine hypnotics.	0.4673085136068352
Fractures of the proximal radius in children may lead to deformities of the radial head and functional disturbance of pro- and supination.	0.7616730178054479
However, traumatization is not only caused by the injury itself, but may also occur secondary to surgical reduction, manipulation of fracture fragments and excessive physiotherapy.	0.6882048691663142
In a prospective long-term follow-study (2-20 years after trauma) of 38 children with displaced proximal radius fractures we found functional disturbances in 11 % of children only.	0.8515597418981008
These were not caused by radial head deformities, which were present on 83 % of follow-up radiographs.	0.8060597878610615
Functional impairment was mainly seen after open reduction or secondary growth disturbances.	0.43016057154911036
On follow-up radiographs all conservatively treated fracture angulations up to 60  ° had corrected themselves spontaneously.	0.5088986697134993
In view of the high complication rates after open reduction and the poor functional results, as well as the inconvenience for the pediatric patient and the economic aspects, we recommend a primary conservative treatment concept of proximal radius fractures in children.	0.7926041035071129
Patients who have undergone cardiac surgery with use of extracorporeal circulation frequently reveal marked hypovolaemia in spite of a highly positive fluid balance.	0.5649262720053982
This is thought to be due to transient microvascular damage and extravascular fluid shift.	0.37750145973347815
Further volume replacement to achieve haemodynamic stability in the postoperative period may cause fluid overload and congestive heart failure.	0.4889905158988162
The present study was designed to investigate whether this fluid overload could be avoided by using a hypertonic-hyperoncotic solution (group I: HHL, 10% hydroxyethylstarch 200/0.5 in 7.2% saline) instead of two different standard colloid solutions (group II: HA, 5% albumin; group III: HES, 6% hydroxyethylstarch in 0.9% saline).	0.7649571443658338
Purpose: The temporomandibular joint is a place of motion where release of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 (IL-1) induces cartilage destruction via production of nitric oxide (NO).	0.5150468622692776
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of continuous passive motion in the form of cyclic stretch on the synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).	0.471690489706968
Methods: Articular chondrocytes were harvested from rabbit cartilage slices and cultured in F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.	0.42042160120093214
Subsequently, cells (105/ml per well) were transferred to Flexercell plates, grown to 90% confluency, and subjected to one of the following regimens: (1) no mechanical strain (10 Hz, 20% elongation rate); (2) rhIL-1 (1 ng/ml); (3) mechanical strain; (4) mechanical strain and rhIL-1.	0.7279637583558777
The cells were exposed to cyclic stretch for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were trypsinized and centrifuged on microscope slides in a cytospin centrifuge.	0.4011220405805335
The presence of iNOS was determined by indirect immunoperoxidase staining using polyclonal rabbit anti-iNOS as primary antibodies, and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as secondary antibodies.	0.5034254485495746
Diaminobenzidine was used as substrate for HRP.	0.3613482877030649
Total NO production was spectrophotometrically measured in the supernatants of cultures using Greiss reaction.	0.2910012610198119
All experiments were done in triplicates and the statistical significance was analyzed by Student's t-test.	0.49101616395346315
Results: Cells with treatment 1 and 3 did not exhibit presence of iNOS.	0.5330654387223267
IL-1-treated cells in group 2 exhibited intense peroxidase staining.	0.7705877711995265
Cells in group 4 exposed to IL-1 and mechanical stress showed staining with considerably less intensity.	0.5306875326436867
Control cells treated with normal rabbit IgG as a primary antibody did not exhibit peroxidase staining.	0.5086530648412894
The data were further confirmed by measurement of statistically significant differences of NO levels in supernatants assessed in the four different treatment groups.	0.581846991109728
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that continuous passive motion exerts anti-inflammatory effects on chondrocytes, downregulating the quantity of iNOS -positive cells.	0.5183912998563754
Since NO acts as an intracellular, transcellular, and cytotoxic molecule, it has a basic importance for proper post-traumatic and postoperative TMJ function as well as the course and therapy of inflammatory TMJ diseases.	0.7332187340761329
Recently, we presented an implantable piezoelectrical hearing aid transducer.	0.5463956856276423
Its characteristics make it suitable for implantation in patients with sensorineural hearing loss.	0.4040497759569174
The transducer transmits micromechanical vibrations instead of sound into the hearing organ.	0.32297709963934457
Efficiency of the transducer implant was investigated in ten cat ears.	0.6218347562068737
After determining preoperative (acoustical) BERA threshold, the middle ear was opened and the piezoelectrical transducer coupled to various ossicles or the perilymph.	0.5128755035410597
BERA responses were recorded following stimulation of umbo, long incus process, stapes head, stapes foot plate, and vestibulum.	0.5613988166596473
By comparing the acoustical and mechanical threshold, a correlation was found between the stimulus level of acoustical and mechanical stimulation.	0.612412892995083
An electrical transducer voltage of 1 Vrms* was equivalent to sound-pressure levels between 100 and 128 dB SPL at the tympanic membrane.	0.41008483356760733
To judge hearing impression, stimulus-dependent latencies of the early acoustically and mechanically evoked potentials (waves P1 to P5) and their thresholds were analyzed.	0.5255115507094021
After coupling the piezoelectrical transducer to the long incus process, latencies corresponded well to stimulation.	0.41386045633911794
They were almost completely similar when the equivalent sound-pressure level of 100 dB SPL was achieved by the transducer voltage level.	0.5091546644659123
Pyoderma gangrenosum was first described in 1930 by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O'Leary.	0.33012390170351624
Nevertheless we found some illustrations in an atlas on dermatology, published by Marie-Nicolas Devergie in the first half of the 19th century, which appear to be pyoderma gangrenosum.	0.5307986310475645
In addition to discussions of typical syphilitic affections of the skin, Devergie's "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" includes illustrations of gangrenous ulcers, which appeared unexpectedly after local and systemic therapy with mercury.	0.5197373836238034
Devergie interpreted those enlarging ulcers as a side effect of mercury therapy.	0.33802722110296746
Thus we were able to find evidence of pyoderma gangrenosum more than 100 years before first description in 1930.	0.4092114694979891
The etiology of this clinical picture is still unsettled.	0.708129713143463
The favorite postulate has been a bacterial genesis which was the subject of numerous publications until the 1960s.	0.5169769474097666
Multiple-system atrophy (MSA) is characterized by progressive autonomic failure with cerebellar, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs.	0.459978385359451
In MSA patients laryngoscopy often reveals unilateral or bilateral abductor vocal fold palsies.	0.3053555250243923
However, assessment of sites of obstruction and their severity is needed.	0.4394888551362929
We report our clinical experience in managing a 56-year-old, obese male MSA patient (1.76 m height, 100 kg weight, BMI 32.3 kg/m2) who was admitted for evaluation of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness.	0.7131764772750839
Endoscopy while awake demonstrated an incomplete abductor vocal fold palsy.	0.28147833398384886
Polysomnography confirmed heavy snoring with arousals (11.1/h) and an RDI of 1.4/h.	0.857785335704599
Sleep efficiency was low (51.9%) due to long intermittent awake periods.	0.4808681691978188
Sleep videoendoscopy of the upper airway proved the entire pharynx to be open during REM and non-REM sleep.	0.5181116377061872
During inspiration fluttering movements of the vocal cords caused the snoring.	0.39920443704631325
This was regularly terminated by arousals.	0.24395741022894765
The further treatment is discussed.	0.4047611258668713
In general, glottic snoring without daytime stridor is rare and has only been described in MSA patients.	0.5413179720533562
However, certain of these patients will also be pharyngeal snorers.	0.7185552328747774
The source of the sound and site of obstruction can only be diagnosed by sleep videoendoscopy.	0.6155046694564278
Introduction: Homografts for valve replacement are indicated in acute valve endocarditis.	0.44055179153649693
It is assumed that they possess anti-infective properties.	0.3708634669123576
Homografts are an established indication in aortic valve replacement.	0.4219032328886757
We present our early results with homografts for mitral valve replacement in acute endocarditis.	0.5525546130762801
The surgical management of enlarged inferior turbinates has been actively debated for more than a century.	0.44267393906609387
The second part of this review decribes the following techniques: laterofracture, submucous turbinectomy, concho-antropexy, partial turbinectomy, anterior turbinectomy, inferior turbinoplasty, total turbinectomy, and vidian neurectomy.	0.607917215367414
Indications, advantages, disadvantages, complications, and controversies of each treatment modalitiy are reviewed and discussed.	0.5500913151077275
Partial or submucosal resection should be prefered, because there are moderate side effects and the amount of turbinate excised can be altered according the degree of symptomatology.	0.5357781345784234
Total turbinectomy or vidian neurectomy are indicated if all other treatment attemps do not succeed.	0.3328644002550376
Acute oxalosis is an important disorder causing serious abnormalities.	0.4949189616469153
Acute oxalosis may come about by ethylene glycol poisoning; in recent years iatrogenic cases of acute oxalosis have also been described following iv treatments of naftidrofuryl, a vasodilator.	0.6100849818472855
Furthermore, chronic asymptomatic intestinal oxalosis may turn symptomatic by a superimposed major load of oxalate.	0.43865116633774276
Acute oxalosis results in acute renal failure; in addition oxalate-induced angiopathy may be associated with necrosis of affected tissue.	0.5873301269457415
The diagnosis of acute oxalosis requires a demonstration of oxalate crystals in the urine and in other affected tissues.	0.6210246352826515
In terms of therapy, hemodialysis should be used promptly in cases of ethylene glycol poisoning and a worsening of the renal function.	0.5520132231057463
In cases of a secondary chronic intestinal oxalosis prophylactic measures such as maintaining an elevated urinary flow rate and prescribing oral calcium supplements will be helpful.	0.48588326101572316
Generalized granuloma annulare is a rare variant of granuloma annulare affecting the trunk and extremities with a multitude of lesions.	0.5592003781383258
In contrast to localized granuloma annulare, generalized granuloma annulare occurs in older patients, shows a stronger association with diabetes, and is characteristically chronic.	0.6967679556173053
Like our 55-year-old patient, most patients present with papules and annular plaques; less often, macular or non-annular lesions may be encountered.	0.5575679552401622
Histology often fails to show necrobiotic or necrotic connective tissue changes demarcated by a palisading granuloma.	0.30683968493657676
Instead, there are diffuse dermal, band-like or nodular aggregations of histiocytes intermingled with some multinucleated giant cells and a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate in the periphery.	0.45951765555174184
Because of its special characteristics, it has been suggested that generalized granuloma annulare might constitute a separate disease entity and that it should be classed among the primary cutaneous histiocytoses as a diffuse dermal histiocytosis.	0.6651739248513792
Using immunohistochemistry to determine the macrophage phenotype of the lesional histiocytes, we have shown that generalized granuloma annulare is not a cutaneous histiocytosis.	0.744964967185208
Neither MS-1 high-molecular-weight protein, a new specific marker for cutaneous non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses, nor CD1a, the well-known marker for Langerhans cells and Langerhans cell histiocytoses, is expressed by the lesional histiocytes of our patient.	0.6195589965726063
In contrast, the antigen expression pattern was diagnostic for non-infectious granulomas and was highly similar to that in localized granuloma annulare.	0.5569873848031066
In contrast to the successful treatment of localized granuloma annulare reported with intralesional interferon -1, systemic treatment with interferon -2b (9x106 units three times a week) was ineffective.	0.7526176237753237
The aims of the study were: (1) to predict reversal time from intensive atracurium blockade; and (2) to determine the optimal time of neostigmine administration during recovery from atracurium blockade, i.e., the time at which the administration of neostigmine results in the shortest total recovery time (time from administration of last supplemental dose of atracurium to train-of-four [TOF] ratio 0.70), and at the same time results in the shortest time from administration of neostigmine to TOF ratio 0.70.	0.7504345105353243
The spontaneous and neostigmine-facilitated recovery in 52 healthy women anaesthetised with thiopentone, fentanyl, droperidol, and nitrous oxide was followed.	0.43919026417513773
Post-tetanic count (PTC) of TOF stimulation of the ulnar nerve and mechanomyography were used for monitoring neuromuscular transmission.	0.6261261103285345
The neuromuscular blockade was induced with atracurium 0.6 mg/kg and supplemental doses of 0.15 mg/kg were given when the first twitch response in the TOF (TH1) had recovered to 20%.	0.6576047593701924
Neostigmine 0.036 mg/kg body weight was given at different levels of neuromuscular blockade to 37 of the patients.	0.5784184806216555
Multiple regression analyses including pre-reversal time (time from administration of the last atracurium dose to neostigmine administration), PTC, weight, and age of the patients suggest that pre-reversal time is the best predictor of reversal time: reversal time=27.3 min-(0.89xpre-reversal time [min]; (SEE=6.0 min).	0.681816431620128
If pre-reversal time is unknown, PTC can be used: reversal time=24 min-(4.5xln PTC) at time of reversal); (SEE=6.8 min).	0.7366832385569702
Total recovery time was 47 min (SEM=2.0 min, n=15) in the patients allowed to recover spontaneously, and 29 min (SEM=1.2 min, n=29) in the patients reversed by neostigmine; the difference of 18 min (SE diff 2.0 min) was significant (P<0.0005).	0.7949083170694098
The level of blockade indicated by PTC (1 - 24) at the time of reversal had no influence on the total recovery time.	0.7744454203725364
The spontaneous recovery times from reappearance of TH1 and TH1=10% to TOF ratio 0.70 were 29.2 min (SEM=1.7 min) and 24.4 min (SEM=2.6 min), respectively.	0.62914947898365
The results suggest that pre-reversal time is the strongest predictor of reversal time when neostigmine is administered during intense atracurium blockade.	0.4367262451950174
To achieve the optimal time-saving effect, neostigmine must be given 18 min (the time saved by giving neostigmine) plus 7 to 11 min (needed for neostigmine to reach its peak effect), giving a total of 25 to 29 min before TOF ratio 0.70.	0.5912883747925406
As TH1 is between 1% and 10% 25 to 29 min before TOF ratio 0.70 is reached during spontaneous recovery, the optimal level of neuromuscular blockade for neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade is when TH1 is between 1% and 10%.	0.600383369313281
Reversal time can be predicted as 27.3 min-(0.89xpre-reversal time (min), and the optimal time of neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade appears to be when TH1 is 1% - 10%.	0.795914608544986

A high coincidence with symptoms of preeclampsia is observed.	0.3920647986017987
The high rate of complications and the restitution of laboratory findings to normal values following cessation of pregnancy have led to the general recommendation of immediate delivery for about a decade.	0.6060436455719149
However, the fact that HELLP syndrome can also occur for up to 1 week post-partum and the results of studies on prolongation of pregnancy call this former concept of management into question, in particular, since there is a high rate of hemostasiological complications after cesarean section in acute HELLP syndrome.	0.665143952423503
Because of the correlation of complications of HELLP syndrome with those of severe preeclampsia, the indication for delivery should be based on the signs of preeclampsia and additional clinical features.	0.6900810579225845
The results of studies on prolongation of pregnancies in HELLP syndrome and severe preeclampsia support this concept.	0.4771738805534667
Innervation of the head and neck differs from other regions of the body in certain respects.	0.647200450531164
In particular, besides the external cuneate nucleus, thick-calibre neck muscle afferents project directly, to the vestibular nuclear complex.	0.5080483316598933
This projection is most prominent in segments C2 and 3 and is sparse or absent in more caudal segments.	0.42028661918630855
Thus, proprioceptive neck muscle afferents gain direct access to vestibulospinal, vestibulooculomotor and other secondary or even higher order vestibular neurons that receive labyrinthine input.	0.35542975650759656
Proprioceptive input via indirect spinovestibular pathways is also most prominent from C2 and 3 compared to more caudal levels.	0.3442866018070646
Likewise, thin calibre, mainly nociceptive afferents from cervical segments are channelled via the parabrachial nuclei in the rostral pons to limbic structures different from the targets of thoracolumbar afferents.	0.42089241937814303

During routine middle ear surgery prototypes of implantable piezoelectric hearing aid transducers were coupled to the ossicular chain of 28 patients.	0.4689887591644972
Pure tone thresholds in a broad frequency range (250 Hz-8 kHz) and perception of music were the basis of psychoacoustic evaluation of the transfer properties of the prototypes in this human study.	0.6755169067785018
The piezoelectric transducer reached an equivalent transducer sound-pressure level of up to 145 dB SPL and frequencies of 10 kHz.	0.4247869199634192
The dynamics for music reached 32 dB, which was identical with the results of the preoperative investigations using hi-fi headsets (33 dB).	0.7176509394205209

Introduction: Improved socio-economic conditions have led to an increase of adult height during the last century.	0.7080905172588651
If excessive height is regarded as a serious psychological handicap, final height can be reduced by early and high doses treatment with sexual steroids.	0.5715323720143339
This therapy influences pubertal development and growth of healthy adolescents.	0.34780635232444496
For that reason patients should be carefully selected, taking into account the benefits and possible side effects.	0.5592711666721828
Colour measurements were performed on powdery substances of whitish to slightly yellow colouring (cocaine samples of different composition) in order to give an unequivocal optical description of the samples and relate them to control samples.	0.5467973034540983
The measurements were carried out with a spectrophotometer (Carl-Zeiss-Jena GmbH, MCS 400) using a halogen bulb as light source (standard illuminant D65).	0.5041523791614818
Colorimetric classification was made on the basis of the CIE-L*a*b*-values.	0.3361264949719421
The examination showed that specimens of similar or different chemical composition which could not be distinguished macroscopically revealed characteristic differences in the CIE-L*a*b*-measures.	0.40003760294923024
The method gives a first clue for orientation within a few minutes when comparing substances in specimens of different origin.	0.5456244152349694
Eighty-five patients with grade 2 or grade 3 sprains of the acromioclavicular (AC) joint were evaluated clinically and radiographically 32 months after injury.	0.6141340759666806
Group I included 34 patients with grade 2 sprains (Tossy II) and group II included 51 patients with grade 3 injuries (Tossy III).	0.7334695398246983
In group I, 15 patients were treated surgically (group I a) and 19 patients were treated conservatively (group I b), while in group II, 41 patients were treated surgically (group II a) and 10 patients were treated conservatively (group II b).	1.0553858686540765
At surgery open reduction and transarticular fixation of the AC joint with Kirschner wires was performed.	0.4759111644081399
Conservative treatment included the initial use of a sling or a knapsack bandage and early performance of range-of-motion exercises.	0.49659743182188
Shoulder function was assessed according to the score devised by Constant and Murley.	0.47515612757327125
In both groups, 97 of 100 possible points (minimum 72, maximum 100) were obtained after conservative and after surgical treatment.	0.6760197548233366
Nine of 10 patients (90%) with grade 3 sprains (group IIb) had more pronounced displacement and increased mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle after conservating treatment.	0.8442143900045102
After surgery, dislocation and increased horizontal, mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle occurred in 18 (44%) of 41 patients with grade 3 sprains (group II a P<0.0001).	0.7938345019697066
However, these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome.	0.6854799040872255
At follow-up there was a significant increase in degenerative changes seen on radio-graphs (P<0.035) in all patients.	0.7244523973152989
Again these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome.	0.4085552632796992
More degenerative radiological changes were observed in patients who had undergone surgery (P<0.003).	0.7133666844193429
Patients with grade 2 sprains were more frequently restricted in sporting activity after surgery (P<0.05).	0.4542076955799617
Patients with grade 3 sprains who were treated surgically complained of pain more frequently (P<0.01), and they returned to work later than patients who were treated conservatively after grade 3 sprains.	0.7556392960942931
An additional rehabilitation program guided by a physiotherapist seemed to have no impact on the functional outcome.	0.5644116978343967
A total of 56 patients were treated by surgery.	0.7978607250321711
Among these patients 11 complications occurred, requiring five additional surgical procedures.	0.39872004728006305
Among 29 conservatively treated patients, only in 1 patient did subacromially located arthritic changes of the AC joint have to be removed.	0.7067489106424253
Macular amyloidosis (MA) and lichen amyloidosus (LA) are the two major variants of the primary cutaneous amyloidoses which present with severe and therapy resistent itching.	0.7271816999868891
Various therapeutic modalities such as antihistamines, intralesional injection or topical application of corticosteroids, etretinate, UVB irradiation and dermoabrasion have been employed with variable success.	0.41879506750816436
Recently, in a few case reports authors have observed encouraging beneficial clinical effects by using topical dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO).	0.6170732595144279
In our study 10 patients with either MA or LA or biphasic amyloidosis were treated with a 50% solution of DMSO in water.	0.7038192790981499
9 of them showed marked clinical improvement at the end of 6-20 weeks of treatment.	0.5370698072354485
Degranulation and depletion of the mast cells by DMSO is the most probable explanation for the rapid improvement of itching beginning within the first week of therapy.	0.680662931399645
Remarkable flattening of the lichenoid papules which was obtained within 11 weeks of treatment is interpreted as a result of the improvement of itching and the related scratch effect.	0.6850093934617212
Histological examination after treatment revealed no disappearance of amyloid deposits in the papillary dermis.	0.5191157325785689
In the follow-up period relapses of itching and papules were observed.	0.5686847185762123
Therefore further studies are needed to find out the optimal procedure of therapy.	0.5018663942326848
As early as 1974, Brian advocated the prone position for ventilated patients [5].	0.4202849152857686
He suggested that this position might enhance ventilation of the dorsal parts of the lungs, thereby improving oxygenation.	0.628636599789868
These considerations have been confirmed by several experimental and clinical studies [1, 6, 13, 17].	0.6985590919175743
Better secretion removal, decreased intrapulmonary shunting, and an increased FRC are thought to be responsible for the observed improvement of oxygenation.	0.717661248772081
However, the prone position never became very popular in the clinical treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	0.6083757555364309
Routine performance of thoracic CT scans in ARDS patients demonstrated preferential distribution of pathological densities in the dependent lung areas.	0.39585081290670265
The prone position therefore could possibly benefit these patients, as shown by two recent studies [8, 11].	0.6201026362826483
The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position on gas exchange and thoracic CT findings in multiple-trauma patients.	0.601527824867712
Seven ventilated intensive care patients with severe ARDS (Murray Score >2.5 [9], Quotient >0.7 [4], mean airway pressure >18 cm H2O, thoracic CT scan showing dorsal atelectases) were included in the study.	0.8633642777927638
Patients were turned from the supine to the prone position at 12-h intervals using an air-cushion bed (Mediscus, Austria).	0.40016785149057943
Redistribution of dystelectatic or atelectatic dependent lung areas was verified by means of repeated thoracic CT scans (Figs.	0.39154757439780413
The patients were intermittently turned for 6.5  +/-  1.1 days.	0.9448009150446568
The course of gas exchange is shown in Figs.	0.513684540615435
Initially, improvement of the respiratory quotient could only be achieved during prone positioning, from the 2nd day in the supine position as well.	0.7466945154705182
Intrapulmonary shunting showed a similar trend (Figs.	0.29378763112604256
No significant changes in cardiovascular parameters could be observed.	0.4729415224504603
Control thoracic CT scans showed uniform reduction of atelectases in dependent lung areas (Figs.	0.43550598130799384
The inspiratory fraction of oxygen could be reduced significantly as of the 2nd day (Fig.	0.5749829570828939
Constant levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and tidal volume were associated with decreasing mean and plateau airway pressures (Fig.	0.431920320368171
Repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position produced long-lasting improvement of arterial oxygenation, which persists up to the end of the weaning process.	0.6709694975643545
This is in good accordance with other studies [1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 13, 17], however, this is the first study to report an observation period of more than 6 days of repeatedly turning the patient.	0.7533073194253566
These positive effects on gas exchange can be attributed to sudden improvement of the ventilation-perfusion ratio within the lung areas that become dependent after turning to the prone position.	0.4609641342822402
Due to reduced hydrostatic pressure [11] and relative hyperventilation [7, 16], previously collapsed alveoli are recruited in the lung areas that become non-dependent after turning to the prone position.	0.48571219871450455
After a gynecological operation under therapy with unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin, a 63 year old patient developed right-sided ascending pelvic thrombosis with multiple pulmonary embolism and infarction pneumonia, septic-toxic circulatory failure, and thrombocytopenia.	0.6310485033899438
Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia (HAT) type II was diagnosed.	0.45557574695244335
Because of contraindications against thrombolysis a cava-filter was implanted, heparin therapy was stopped, and anticoagulation with recombinant hirudin was started.	0.5071935691903589
Inspite of this, an arterial thrombosis of the A. femoralis superficialis developed and had to be treated surgically.	0.7004770725716499
From this time on, no further thromboembolic complications were noticed.	0.5533608303335691
Overlapping coumarin therapy was begun.	0.19814683545213488
Due to ubiquitous coumarin-necrosis, rapid progressive toxic circulatory failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) developed two days after terminating hirudin therapy necessitating high dose catecholamine therapy.	0.4249656539032525
A second course of hirudin resulted in complete restitution of the coumarin-necrosis without the need for re-operation.	0.41729197902512727
Subsequent coumarin-therapy, which was gradually increased over two weeks, was without further complications.	0.7088895338533546
Thus, hirudin appears to be a new and safe alternative to a therapy with the heparinoid danaparoid in HAT type II with fulminant thromboembolic complications and especially in coumarin-necrosis with critical septic-toxic circulatory failure and DIC.	0.6227239211133248
A prospective process-analysis evaluating organizational, medical and medical-technical alterations and real-time-documentation during out-of-hospital resuscitations (n=71) was performed due to the definitions of the "Utstein-Style".	0.6123630282153142
The gaseous radical nitric oxide (NO) is catalyzed by conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by one cytokine inducible form (iNOS), which becomes active only within hours after the inducing event, and by two constitutively expressed forms, endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal (nNOS), which are regulated by the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+.	0.6080811832921783
Brain nNOS is physiologically present in discrete populations of neurons, which are all excited by glutamate via the ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which controls a Ca2+ channel.	0.5077170198077017
After its diffusion into the extraneuronal space, NO may activate in neurons, which as a rule do not stain for NOS, soluble guanylyl cyclase and formation of cGMP as an intracellular messenger.	0.5216455030228813
Beyond that, NO is important as a feedback regulator of glutamatergic excitation.	0.5043007956674634
NO as a nitrosylating agent enhances disulfide bonding of vicinal sulfhydryl (thiol) groups of the redox modulatory site of the NMDA receptor complex and thereby down-regulates its Ca2+ channel activity.	0.3526916872454176
Histochemically studies have revealed the presence of large number of NOS containing neurons in the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of hypothalamic nuclei.	0.361279059693962
Numerous studies conform to the view that NO participates in the control of many different neurosecretory processes, especially of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurosecretory system.	0.566142734685682
The redox-modulatory site of the NMDA receptor appears, therefore, as a critical structure in the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.	0.5336182120901477
Moreover, glucocorticoids augment neuronal excitotoxicity by increasing the expression of glutamate receptors and inhibition of glutamate reuptake.	0.38351604089710567
In attempting to explain the many conflicting results obtained in studies with NO, it may be worthwhile to consider that the actual redox-environment of distinct loci of the brain may determine the final function of NO, acting either as a transmitter or neuromodulator or, in the worst case, causing neurodestruction.	0.6390217029889627
It seems likely that any kind of stress by altering the ratio of reduced vs oxidized thiols within the central nervous system influences neuronal excitability, with NO working either as an amplifier or as a feedback regulator of neuronal excitation or inhibition, which may alter acutely or chronically, among others, the homeostasis of a given neurosecretory system.	0.5914158975357255
Purpose: To study early and late findings of macular retinal thickness in patients with hypotony following filtering procedures.	0.6010609966771728
Even in the era of coronary stenting, acute coronary artery occlusion continues to represent a significant limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).	0.5711095165294399
Despite application of heparin and aspirin, abrupt vessel closure still occurs in 2-8%, depending on the definition applied.	0.4965939866301016
Especially patients receiving PTCA for acute coronary syndromes are at high risk for abrupt vessel closure.	0.5271252302994022
The formation of an intracoronary thrombus plays a central role in the pathogenesis of abrupt vessel closure.	0.4866763090698687
Dipyridamole induces dilatation of coronary arteries and prevents platelet aggregation by a mechanism that differs from that of aspirin.	0.46924566980671223
The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate whether adjunctive local intracoronary therapy with dipyridamole could reduce the incidence of coronary artery occlusion following PTCA.	0.7028816426246626
Secondary endpoints were defined as myocardial infarction, necessity for bypass grafting, and death.	0.548282512385878
The intravesical instillation of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) in cases of relapsed superficial bladder cancer is an acknowledged kind of prophylaxis.	0.4472625982164284
It is uncertainly up to now whether a verification of the immune systems competence is necessary.	0.5521418715291986
The recommendations in this problem are very different.	0.38286342794806416
In conclusion to the recent literature we think that a verification of the immune system before BCG installation in the urinary bladder has not a prognostic value.	0.5327716371648707
Additionally, the legal obligingness of this immunotest is doubtful.	0.46468922591119816
Discoid meniscus is one of the commonest anatomical variations of the meniscus.	0.4294221456980549
There is at the moment no consensus on the aetiology of discoid meniscus.	0.590702833123269
According to Watanabe three types can be differentiated: the complete form, the incomplete form and the hypermobile Wrisberg form.	0.6059528820487831
Discoid meniscus frequently remains asymptomatic and thus requires no treatment.	0.276153054455971
Partial meniscectomy is recommended for treatment of the stable form, while for the unstable forms total meniscectomy is generally regarded as the treatment of choice, since the instability means that rupture of residual meniscus would be possible.	0.8011899928544782
A fourteen years old girl showed the classic signs of acrocephalosyndactyly I: dysostosis craniofacialis with hypertelorism, exophthalmus, strabism, amblyopia and cleft palate as well as syndactyly of the fingers and toes.	0.4219808224993066
The feet showed on both side a 6  cm long horny band.	0.3381585039107739
Since the twelfth year of life, she had suffered from papulo-pustular acne with many comedomes.	0.4647348469071404

The inheritance of acrocephalosyndactyly I is usually autosomal dominant, but sporadic cases are frequent.	0.5077805257331143
Objective: Cognitive dysfunction is a known problem after operations and may be especially relevant in the elderly.	0.6226122374793516
The aim of this international multicentre study was to investigate short- and long-term cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients and to elucidate the relevance of hypoxaemia and hypotension as causative factors.	0.7181038353516077
Autosomal recessive inheritance, intrauterine growth retardation, short stature, microcephaly, distinct facial dysmorphism, psychomotoric retardation, and often uncharacterized eczematous skin lesions distinguish the rare Dubowitz syndrome.	0.4881038460465867
Here a pair of monozygotic twins with Dubowitz syndrome and clear-cut atopic eczema is presented.	0.352133892991551
Humeral shaft fractures can be treated either conservatively or operatively.	0.5915092168640458
Plating of the humerus is the established operative method, but recently interest has also been focussed on intramedullary nailing.	0.6092509680808175
Fifty-nine cases of humeral fractures treated with intramedullary nailing (Seidel/Marchetti-Vicenzi/Prévot) from January 1991 to December 1995 (44 fractures after trauma, 11 pathological fractures, 3 pseudarthroses, 1 re-fracture).	0.6289817496550687
Closed reduction in 55/59 cases.	0.2879571040642427
One infection (soft tissue); 2/48 pseudarthrosis (indication for nailing: pseudarthrosis!).	0.47419174063011105
No iatrogenic palsy of the radial nerve.	0.4828845468833809
Functional postoperative treatment in all 44 cases of humeral fractures after adequate trauma.	0.4370295029696596
One poor functional result: periarticular ossification after retrograde nailing, possibly connected with long-term respiratory treatment after trauma.	0.43626122370329523
Treatment of humeral shaft fractures by intramedullary nailing is favoured in our clinic (low complication rates, excellent or good functional results, limited approaches, small scars).	0.6612771535265138
Proximal fractures should be treated by the Seidel nail (stable interlocking of the proximal fragment); very distal fractures need Prévot nailing (reaming of condylar canals).	0.5253971873322858
All other fractures of the humeral shaft can be treated by each of the implants used in our clinic.	0.8279439390867956
Pathological fractures are an excellent indication for intramedullary stabilization.	0.42656631151724644
These patients benefit from stable fixation without intense surgical trauma.	0.3224218365821565
Pseudarthrosis, according to our limited experience, seems to require plating plus bone grafting.	0.4886463680107264
Plating is also recommended if revision of the radial nerve becomes necessary.	0.47010514604773584
2-4 % of vascular injuries need operative reconstruktion.	0.7060123661633365
In polytraumatized patients the rate is even 10 %.	0.4652839663304243
Arterial vascular repair should precede venous reconstruction and orthopaedic stabilization due to limb threatening ischemia.	0.2912975749485243
Penetration or blunt vascular trauma result either in acute blood loss, ischemia or compartmental compression.	0.3946662174117304
Reperfusion syndrom leads to vital threat of patient.	0.2332075945309169
Clinical assessment, measurement of limb pressures using a Doppler device and use of duplex ultrasonography are reliable adjuncts in the rapid evaluation.	0.4088518429833726
Arteriography is rarely indicated and should be spared for patients with abnormal physical examination.	0.5154912230981561
Minimizing ischemia (6-8 h) is an important factor in maximizing limb salvage.	0.9364050144017618
Vascular repair include direct anastomosis or lateral suture repair mostly combined with primary shortening of the extremity.	0.45510431591711786
In most cases autogenous vein graft is required.	0.3839587260142995
Rethrombosis, arteriovenous fistula and pseudoaneurysms are possible complications.	0.2709293631055906
Stabilisation of the fracture has priority over vascular reconstruction.	0.5334336652511953
The initial steps to success are surgical debridement, adequate bony stabilization mostly by external fixation, revascularisation of vascular injury, immediate fascial decompression and early soft-tissue reconstruction.	0.46217450971015095
The best results are obtained when a multidiciplinary approach is used combining expertise in orthopedic surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery.	0.6105879697379041
In secondary prevention, statins are cost-effective and even more cost-effective than other lipid lowering drugs.	0.5741689820944034
Statins are especially favorable in patients with previous myocardial infarction compared to those with angina pectoris.	0.5789976950212219
For secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, statins should be administered generously.	0.5006628628918482
In primary prevention, statins are effective but not cost-efficient.	0.44412240108008444
Unfavorable results have to be expected especially in premenopausal women, younger patients, and in those with a low risk factor profile.	0.8787634348947415
For population based primary prevention, only dietary measures can be advocated; however, apart from a serious lack of compliance their efficiency has not yet been proven.	0.4645394641249967
Preventive measures have their own prize; in general they are considered not to prevent coronary heart disease but retard it.	0.5375065363045081
Therefore, such therapeutic interventions can be assumed not to reduce but rather to increase the "direct" medical costs.	0.7315600930386271
Furthermore, successful prevention of coronary heart disease leads, due to life-prolongation, to an increase in people out of work and in disabled patients due to age and/or disease.	0.6194443826201113
Therefore, an increase especially of the "indirect" costs for unemployment, pension, nursing homes, etc.	0.5758681373127301
Background: There are three fields where the the biochemical cardiac markers creatine kinase (CK), its isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), myoglobin, and troponin can play an important role: (1) the primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), (2) identification of patients suffering from unstable angina with minor myocardial damage (MMD) and consecutively increased risk for major cardiovascular events, and (3) assessment of coronary reperfusion after intravenous thrombolysis.	0.679032434688008
MRSA/MRSE infections are a major problem in hospitals and although in orthopaedic units the incidence is low awareness of this problem is necessary.	0.5953656962276518
Once a MRSA strain has been isolated the strict use of the hygiene precautions has to be applied to avoid epidemic spread of the strain.	0.5807640967778103
The patient has to be isolated.	0.5797613939010937
The staff has to use gloves and gowns whilst treating the patient.	0.31781334074791173
A antimicrobiel hand wash solution has to be used after taking off the gloves and before leaving the isolation room.	0.4547803189485424
Patient and staff have to be informed about the pathogenity and the way of infection spread so that infection precaution rules are fulfilled.	0.574158738923119
Antibiotics should only be used in clinically well defined cases and the overall use of antibiotics should be reduced to lower the incidence of MRSA/E isolates.	0.6981871333452632
The problems of an MRSA case and its successful treatment are demonstrated.	0.4514136683143235
A microphone constructed for implantation in the posterior wall of the auditory canal and a piezoelectric transducer serving as the main components of an implantable hearing aid were temporally implanted in five patients during middle ear surgery under local anesthesia.	0.6341649703064155
The microphone was positioned beneath the skin of the auditory canal such that it completely covered the microphone membrane.	0.46894798529183374
The vibratory element of the transducer was coupled to the malleus in four patients with normal ossicular chains and directly to the stapes in one patient with missing incus.	0.6478964122288786
The microphone and transducer were electrically connected with an external battery-driven signal amplifier.	0.44556419216443394
Speech material and music were presented in the operation room at a sound level of 65 dB SPL under free-field conditions.	0.44383612787259036
The patients had to estimate the quality of speech, music, and their own voice as well as the effects of bone-conducting noises.	0.8188096592937719
All patients were able to hear with the system.	0.43014796911391107
An intraoperative talk without vision contact was possible without any problems, as was understanding of numerals ("Freiburger Zahlentest").	0.5921173696729297
Perception of music was judged as "clear and undistorted with all broadband component."	0.41781485263613627
The estimation was also valid for one patient with a sensorineural hearing loss.	0.665420924271848
One patient declared the music to be "a little of unnatural."	0.43982845545372024
Bone-conducted sound was estimated as normal in two patients, better than without an implant in one patient with sensorineural hearing loss, and "somewhat metallic" in another patient.	0.7431175868519965
Hearing the own voice was considered "normal" in two cases "monotonous" in one case, and "a little bit roaring" in another case.	0.8815670842910887
An amplification factor that can be technically realized in an implantable hearing aid was necessary for one of the patients with sensorineural hearing loss to perceive music at a pleasant volume.	0.6202035150093523
On the basis of this study, essential requirements for the construction of a fully implantable hearing aid are fulfilled.	0.7710745381290555
We report a patient with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) with a first manifestation of homicide.	0.7821395198539746
On admission the patient showed a hebephrenia-like syndrom with inappropriate affect, thought disorder and  behavioral changes.	0.4274305854296919
Magnetic resonance  tomography (MRT) findings suggested a  diagnosis of MLD, which was confirmed by a decreased activity of leucocyte arylsulfatase A and an excessive urinary sulfatide excretion.	0.6315235370552561
The cervical spondylotic myelopathy is the most frequent spinal dysfunction.	0.561296964756805
Its spontaneous course is very variable, from progress to stagnation.	0.4632871377698443
This makes prognosis and decision-making difficult for conservative or operative treatment.	0.4617423743395057
The authors attempt to provide some basis for decision-making by observing the individual course of neural dysfunction, consideration of morphometric data and the use of functional scores.	0.46838627447083525
To advise a patient, the outcome of conservative and operative treatment as described in the literature has to be considered, as well as the possible complications.	0.8521772253608818
The advantages and disadvantages of surgery from the anterior and posterior approach are discussed.	0.5173003772258384
Operative planning according to the individual condition is suggested.	0.5903122483920983
Operative techniques of anterior decompression and fusion are contrasted to laminoplasties.	0.36056959843911085
Subject: In a 7;11 year old boy with trichotillomania (ICD-10 F63.3), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (ICD-10 F90.1), and subclinical minimal cerebral dysfunction, Methylphenidate (Ritalin) medication resulted in a remarkable improvement: unexspected interruption of trichotillomania with regrowth of hair.	0.5810828004191846
An essential feature of the known procedures for the analysis of the ECG signal is the splitting of the ECG into individual parameters which are subsequently processed in defined decision trees, neuronal networks or statistical procedures to diagnostic information.	0.5561909935851241
The correctness of the diagnostic statements thus substantially depends on the suitable selection and the exact determination of the individual criteria.	0.6274497372364022
The analysis algorithm and the expert knowledge are closely linked due to the procedure.	0.45275661338434436
This paper presents a new procedure or the evaluation of signals of medical sensor systems by the example of the ECG.	0.581854469661086
Unlike the methods used up to now, this procedure is not based on an ever more profound splitting of the ECG signal into individual features.	0.7310950044893099
Furthermore, analysis algorithm and knowledge base are separated from each other.	0.5191476838731545
The consideration underlying the procedure is that two ECGs whose leads show identical or very similar signal patterns indicate identical or at least very similar cardiological diagnoses.	0.45729439190447874
As this assumption is the basis of medical experience, it should be possible to compare the signal patterns of the leads of an unknown ECG with those of the leads of the reference ECGs from a database and to draw conclusions for the diagnosis of the unknown ECG.	0.7066301957008421
For this purpose, those ECGs are searched in an ECG database whose leads show greatest agreement with the signal pattern of the unknown ECG.	0.5028482325557763
The function of the method was established with the aid of the ECG signal database CARDIODAT with 249 ECGs for the diagnostic groups: infarcts and healthy reference persons from a data inventory of 550 ECGs.	0.552866258822477
It can be seen from the results that the presented procedure which is based on signal pattern recognition is a new approach to deriving diagnostic information from the ECG signal at least for the diagnostic group of myocardial infarcts.	0.717686467451321
Purpose: The technical conditions, the optimized scanning protocols and the facilities of virtual endoscopy (VE) are presented in an overview.	0.7122893463561513
During a 4-week ambulatory cardiacc rehabilitation program, 262 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), 235 men and 27 women, 53.6+/-10.2 years, performed 30.5+/-2,9 exercise units.	0.6893517547525913
Before and after the rehabilitation program exercise, capacity was assessed by bicycle ergometry.	0.6651270329248273
There was a significant (p<0.001) increase in the maximum exercise capacity at the end of the program (105.3+/-32.3 vs. 121.9+/-37.3 W).	0.6499601035189516
Physical work capacity on the 2.0 mmol lactate level improved (p<0.001) from 72.2+/-23.5 to 86.4+/-25.8 W, on the 2.5 mmol/l level (p<0.001) from 83.5+/-23.2 to 97.4+/-26.4 W, and on the 3.0 mmol/l level (p<0.001) from 93.1+/-23.0 to 106.6+/-26.1 W. Despite enhanced performance, heart rate remained unaltered on the 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 mmol/l lactate level.	0.7707846530966672
Furthermore, ergometric performance on predefined heart rate levels was significantly (p<0.001) increased: 85/min: from 56.0+/-24.1 to 65.8+/-24.5 W; 90/min: from 62.0+/-27.3 to 71.2+/-26 W; 95/min: from 67.2+/-26.4 to 77.5+/-27.6 W; 100/min: from 71.1+/-29.6 to 80.6+/-28.1 W; 105/min: from 69.8+/-26.2 to 81.9+/-28.2 W and 110/min: from 73.6+/-28.9 to 90.4+/-29.4 W. The results demonstrate that physical performance in patients with CAD was improved by our novel ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation program.	0.6707093606434013
This improvement included an increase in maximum as well as endurance work capacity; furthermore, this increase was accompanied by a decrease in resting and exercise heart rates.	0.5252497751434548
The results demonstrate an absolute increase of physical performance, more importantly an increase of physical performance at defined lactate levels in the presence of unchanged heart rates mediated by the rehabilitation program.	0.6176503656149168
Thus, this increase was independent of motivational factors in the patients and/or the investigators during the re-exercise test.	0.7719242599719237
On the contrary, our data demonstrate that it is based on an improvement of aerobic endurance capacity associated with a therapeutically beneficial significant decrease of heart rate for a defined workload.	0.7082684159507241
The effects were independent of pharmacological influences (e.g., -receptor antagonists).	0.7259547372043295
These findings are of clinical importance with respect to reduction of myocardial oxygen consumption in patients with CAD.	0.7193310991245235
Newborn screening programs for inborn errors of metabolism are well established in industrialized countries.	0.46304742363006957
Missed cases may be not only due to errors in specimen collection and laboratory errors but also to failures in adequate follow up.	0.4108833358715294
We report the case of a now 4-year-old girl whose classical phenylketonuria was diagnostically missed in the course of follow-up procedures of a pathological screening result 1067 µmol/l 17,6 mg% phenylalanine.	0.5594657816608893
The separation of whole blood into components is the state-of-the-art in transfusion of allogeneic blood.	0.5770890111749435
The main reasons are the negative effects of the buffy coat and the need for FFP.	0.6392042178718907
Nevertheless, especially in Germany whole blood is being rejected more and more even as autologous blood.	0.561295474478297
However, most of the negative effects of the buffy coat do not apply to autologous blood.	0.5802834978391854
Additionally, these patients usually do not develop coagulation disorders and therefore do not need plasma as a hemostatic component.	0.5877417143210073
On the other hand, separation into components of autologous blood leads to an increase of costs and to logistic problems that restrict autologous blood predeposit to a few institutions.	0.5166046702961116
Therefore, we have reviewed the literature in order to find a scientific basis for this.	0.7974038773880795
We analysed all articles listed by MEDLINE during the last 12 years that dealt with the quality of whole blood or red cell concentrates.	0.5802425873133914
In addition, all references were included that contributed relevant information to the topic.	0.5091096133574068
A total of 135 original articles, abstracts, reviews, letters or editorials were analysed that referred to standard preparations and storage media.	0.35298155906033346
In 48 papers the in vivo red cell survival was studied.	0.4631934200821329
28 of which fulfilled the prerequisites to be included into a meta-analysis.	0.5392615421289975
The following in vitro parameters were also evaluated: pH, potassium load of the units, ATP and DPG concentration of the red cells.	0.5765134732319602
Whole blood (resuspended in CPDA-1) and red cell units (stabilized in CPDA-1 or additive solutions) with a different buffy coat or leucocyte content have comparable pH values and red cell 2,3-DPG and ATP concentrations at the end of the approved storage time.	0.5286632722625034
The potassium load of a whole blood unit appears to be higher than red cell concentrates, but this is to some extent caused by the higher plasma content of whole blood and is not thought to be a clinically relevant problem for patients receiving only a few units.	0.7917292366007539
A number of studies demonstrate that dependent upon the leucocyte content of a red cell unit, leucocyte metabolites and enzymes are released and accumulate during storage.	0.40909301425974753
A detrimental influence on the integrity of the red cell membrane was found in several in vitro studies.	0.6789145580029123
Nevertheless, a significant improvement in red cell survival by leucocyte reduction was detected by only one group.	0.7622481022482477
Undoubtedly, non-hemolytic febrile transfusion reactions (NHFTR) are generally caused by an antibody-antigen interaction due to the transfusion of allogeneic buffy coat.	0.5572939273571335
On the other hand, there is some evidence that non-specific immunological mechanisms such as the release of histamine or cytokines are also capable of causing NHFTR.	0.5620967610310242
Thus, these reactions are expected to occur in autologous blood transfusion.	0.6552946250733248
However, so far, there are no data about the frequency and severity of these reactions and whether they are more likely to emerge after transfusion of blood units with a particular preparation.	0.8248954517175534
Blood transfusions can cause septic complications due to bacterial contamination of the transfused units.	0.412569204411586
These fatal but rare complications may be reduced by pre-storage filtration of blood, but there is no indication that buffy coat reduction is effective.	0.6367378806618625
Three cases with septic complications have been reported after autologous transfusion, in two of which red cell concentrates (at least one was free of buffy coat) had been used.	0.9196683427201164
Thus, there is no justification for the conclusion that the risk of septic complications is increased by transfusion of whole blood.	0.6678188513978919
After all, whole blood and red cell concentrates exhibit only minor differences in relevant in vitro parameters.	0.5314707167137595
Hence, a higher incidence of adverse effects following the transfusion of autologous whole blood compared to autologous red cell concentrations is unlikely.	0.5281162156399555
Therefore, the 24 h in vivo recovery is considered to be the most valid criterion to assess the quality of red cell preparations.	0.6615716043880872
Physical therapy can support geriatric rehabilitation in contributing to better health status, mobility, and quality of life.	0.5408188643182988
However, the central focus of this contribution is not on illness-specific aspects of physical therapy but on power and stamina training.	0.5884431670737146
These two training methods are of special importance for geriatric rehabilitation since most patients are admitted due to related problems and these two methods do imply specific risk factors for the rehabilitation process.	0.6033377844800893
The spectrum of physical adaptation processes supported by power and stamina training is described and scientifically evaluated.	0.45146526314067525
Even in higher age groups positive training effects are possible.	0.3175184281106164
Adequate usage of these training methods contributes to increased competence and a minimization of risks in daily life.	0.40316237682123157
The arthroscopic extraarticular Bankart procedure tries to imitate the open Bankart procedure.	0.29153384499276
An anterior-inferior transmuscular approach through the subscapular muscle permits to implant self-locking tacks into the anterior inferior third of the glenoid rim.	0.46449061927475066
The extraarticular location of the implants makes a superomedial capsular shift possible, if required.	0.5846259012622969
A total of 257 arthroscopic repairs following traumatic recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation have been carried out between 1992 and 1996.	0.406066613808158
177 patients were treated only with bioabsorbable Suretac device.	0.5171720467863105
Clinical and radiological follow up was possible in 165 patients.	0.6719597628821738
According to the Rowe score 69,7 % were classified as excellent, 10,9 % as good, 9,7 % fair and 9,7 % poor.	0.7615542101708344
Postoperative complications: the recurrence rate was 9,7 %, allergic reactions representing a foreign body reaction to the synthetic material were seen in 5 cases (3 %) and a frozen shoulder in 6 cases 3,6 %).	0.7625005605919516
61 % of the patients involved in overhead or contact sports returned to their preoperative sport activities.	0.6759935147929198
Contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography permits comprehensive assessment of the arterial system in the chest, abdomen und lower extremities.	0.663734786532901
The method combines intravenous bolus application of a non-nephrotoxic, paramagnetic, extracellular contrast agent with the acquisition of a fast 3D data set.	0.4670473849295912
High contrast between the vascular lumen and surrounding tissues, inherent three-dimensionality and the ability to collect image data in the chest and abdomen under apnea conditions all contribute to excellent image quality.	0.5230095229009912
Contrast-enhanced 3D MRA is being employed in many centers throughout the world for the evaluation of various arterial pathologies.	0.5101926359979466
This review provides a technical overview and critically discusses the clinical applications in the chest, abdomen and lower extremities based upon the available literature and several clincial examples.	0.5808920961016938
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on prosthetic heart valve recipients remain critical.	0.4822615574782381
A generalized contraindication for MRI is doubtful.	0.34338378145523896
Some diagnostic questions such as interests in pathologies of the posterior cranial fossa, spinal abscesses, and internal derangements for the knee, strongly recommend the advantages of MRI versus all other radiological diagnostic techniques.	0.596239917756592
MRI can directly affect patients with prosthetic valves in three ways by: 1) movement or dislodgment of the prosthesis, 2) heating, and 3) arrhythmias induced by electric currents, and indirectly by distortion of the image and its subsequent misinterpretation.	0.6415313097305179
Present literature that concerns the safety considerations of current values appears to be incomplete.	0.38017963969820734
Therefore, a survey of twenty-five valve manufacturers with regard to compatibility, safety or contraindication for MRI on their respective prosthetic heart valves was performed in 1998.	0.6683576159222075
Those manufacturers who distribute most of the valves in Europe confirmed the safety of MRI.	0.4692252532540581
However, some gave their assurances based on inadequate data, or assigned all responsibility to the physician.	0.6055546111139622
Some companies did not give any assurance for MRI safety or failed to respond to our enquiry.	0.3588623858131921
Two valve manufacturers warned against performing MRI on certain prostheses.	0.24505341353298468
Based on our 1998 questionnaire, the technical issues, the clinical circumstances, the prerequisites and criteria for and the definition of safety standards for MRI on prosthetic heart valve recipients are presented in this paper.	0.8592310959840214
Argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) is a frequently occurring degenerative illness of the aging human brain.	0.5897722238701688
It is accompanied by progressive pathological alterations of the cytsokeleton which are traceable to an abnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule associated tau protein.	0.3936541067115756
Histologically, it is possible with the help of suitable staining techniques to identify pathognomonic spindle-shaped cellular inclusions (argyrophilic grains).	0.5773037769793751
These cellular inclusions display a typical cortical as well as subcortical distribution pattern.	0.36246609727344575
The goal of the present study is the retrospective evaluation of the clinical findings from 53 individuals with neuropathologically demonstrable AGD-related changes of the brain.	0.8679987986794545
Nearly one-half of the cases (49%) was classifiable as demented in accordance with DSM IV-criteria.	0.6128257495843282
Moreover, the frequency of the dementia increased significantly in relation to the growing severity of the AGD-associated pathological cytoskeletal degeneration.	0.6386695520765306
These results confirm the assumption that AGD can cause degenerative changes ranging from cognitive impairment all the way to dementia.	0.5215551110385208
They also underscore the necessity of further prospective studies pertaining to the clinical aspects of this still enigmatic disease.	0.5781691001549628
The major problems in the treatment of open fractures with high blood loss are hypothermia acidosis and coagulopathy.	0.5708262137924788
By improving the standards of polytrauma management and using massive transfusion systems, which should help to avoid those complications, the indication for primary limb salvage under hypovolemic shock conditions is greatly increased.	0.6361977480946367
The following case of an grade 3 open fracture of the femur with severe soft-tissue damage, including vascular lesions, with consecutive massive transfusion, should demonstrate that the cardiac-respiratory system can still be stabilized, even if a surgical solution seems impossible.	0.7684503181157797
Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is mostly found in middle aged women in skin areas exposed to sunlight.	0.3582035021131404
Our 17-year-old female patient had a widespread reddish-brown lesion on the abdomen that met the histological criteria for annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma.	0.4736620278237427
However, the clinical findings and the localization were uncommon.	0.9435025309019761
UV light was excluded as a trigger.	0.430219581782056
Other, still unknown, factors that might change antigenicity of elastic fibres must be considered.	0.5426640217296229
Spontaneous resolution suggests a transient influence of such factors.	0.33496065374836903
Differential diagnosis includes skin disorders with elastolysis; discrimination especially from mid-dermal elastolysis is not well defined.	0.4106953212518548
Traumatic instability of the sternoclavicular joint is a rare diagnosis.	0.6611313560006158
It is usually treated by different bandaging techniques without the possibility of early functional aftercare.	0.4807020115159723
In the period betweeen 1 January 1996 and 31 December 1998, a total of eight patients with unstable sternoclavicular joints requiring surgical treatment were treated with Balser plates.	0.6558518679996038
The population comprised sevenanterior and one posterior dislocations.	0.25428815080676626
A 81-year-old man presented with massive hemoptysis and dyspnea.	0.4573712336596167
Results of chest radiography and computer tomography were highly suspicious for a large right-sided tumor of the bronchus with impression of the right main bronchus.	0.6041444165263564
Because of clinical worsening the patient was transferred to our department of pulmonology.	0.7085230950503699
The patient died of unappeasable hemoptysis the next day.	0.5559538026988096
At autopsy we found a 2-cm-diameter tumor of the proximal trachea as the source of massive bleeding and blood aspiration.	0.7063710149865267
Histological examination confirmed the tumor to be an epithelioid angiosarcoma of the trachea, which was a primary as no other tumor manifestation was detected.	0.7115422714232111
The entity of epithelioid angiosarcoma as a primary tumor of the trachea, to our knowledge, has not yet been reported.	0.7683890948429621
The benefits of epidural analgesia are well known, but it is not well understood which types of urologic surgery benefit most from epidural analgesia.	0.6838350643996763
In this study, the effects and side effects of prolonged epidural analgesia are prospectively examined and analysed on 172 adult patients in three different operation groups.	0.6459205147809518
An epidural infusion of local anaesthetic combined with an opioid and adrenaline was given for a period of 5-7 days.	0.753741436294147
There was no difference between the groups with respect to the effectiveness of the analgesia and patients' perception of the treatment.	0.8176057752859948
Mobilization differed, as expected, between the groups, however even after the most major surgery (e. g. cystectomy with bladder substitution), mobilization was impressively unproblematic.	0.7588529199668841
Retarded return of regular intestinal function after the transperitoneal operation and partly after lumbotomy compared with the extraperitoneal operation depended on which operation was performed and the amount of analgesia given.	0.5082367370687396
The side effects such as sedation, nausea and pruritis were conditional partly on the opiate and partly on the intervention.	0.4817119791819415
Up to 11 % showed slight muscular weakness of the lower limbs as a specific side effect of the local anaesthetic.	0.9107171564736141
Complications: One patient died of cerebral hypoxy due to an initially undetected subdural catheter placement complicated by severe pre-existent carotid stenosis.	0.5728408981352507
In four patients, the epidural analgesia had to be stopped because of catheter migration.	0.7006726111544362
There was no clinical evidence of hematoma, abscess or permanent neurological damage.	0.5450121313031012
Epidural analgesia works well in terms of analgesia, mobilization and patient satisfaction, bearing in mind the potential side effects and complications.	0.5465691456364519
It can be recommended for lumbotomy and long transperitoneal operations however not for extraperitoneal interventions in the lower abdomen such as radical prostatectomy.	0.5423774453638278
High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) provides excellent contrast between osseous structures, air and soft tissue in conjunction with high spatial resolution.	0.508195419418296
Therefore, thin-section HRCT with bone window setting is the method of choice for the examination of the middle ear structures.	0.6637406704213551
The indications are acute and chronic inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma and tumor, the "postoperative middle ear", and malformations.	0.673638277159012
In most cases, HRCT enables differentiation between inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma, and tumor.	0.5679679603745532
The excellent depiction of subtle osseous details enables the identification of erosions of the ossicles or of the bony walls of the mastoid cells, of osseous defects of the tegmen, of the bony labyrinth, and of the tympanic course of the facial canal.	0.792559590797692
In addition, HRCT enables excellent depiction of reconstructions of the ossicles or prosthesis of the ossicles.	0.5007634399768126
Although HRCT is the first method of choice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide additional information and lead to a more accurate diagnosis in some cases.	0.719859245140494
This is explained by the excellent soft tissue contrast provided by MRI.	0.5258686912267773
In addition, MRI offers the possibility of using various pulse sequences and the administration of IV contrast material.	0.513417962940453
Therefore, MRI may allow the differentiation between inflammatory changes, cholesteatoma, and tumor in those cases in which accurate diagnosis cannot be made by HRCT.	0.7591548329414674
The differentiation between a meningocele or meningoencephalocele and other entities such as tumors or cholesteatoma can be established by MRI.	0.48164960010011637
Furthermore, MRI can accurately depict cases of labyrinthitis or of neuritis of the facial nerve or of intracranial disease caused by middle ear processes, while this is not always possible by HRCT.	0.6565236133565882
Morbidity and mortality after emergency procedures in 105 patients with perforated colonic diverticulitis were evaluated in a retrospective study.	0.646864164973781
In different stages of diverticulitis (Hinchey classification: I, 8.6 %; II, 14.3 %; III, 57.1 %; IV, 20.0 %) mortality was 12.4 %.	0.75363107774616
Preoperative sepsis syndrome with leucopenia and disturbed liver function, cardiac risk factors and obesity were independent prognostic factors in multiple logistic regression.	0.5724487155030075
Accompanied by immunosuppression the mortality rate remarkably increased to 33 %.	0.43491936090444566
The stage of peritonitis showed no influence on the prognosis.	0.6037620298272466
In multivariate analysis, surgical procedure (primary resection 12.4 %, Hartmann's procedure 61.9 %, non-resection procedures 25.7 %) showed influence only on increased general complications.	0.6219007996993124
The role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on patients with histologically confirmed acute cholecystitis is still controversial.	0.5986897958698122
From January 1992 to December 1996, 228 cholecystectomies were performed for acute cholecystitis and a total of 104 patients were operated on conventionally and 124 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery.	0.5013171034370014
In a prospective study we compared the conventional with the laparoscopic technique.	0.6806821684354609
The results indicated that in 19 patients (15.3 %) treated initially with the laparoscopic technique, a switch to laparotomy was required.	0.7335050004647192
The operating duration was lower for conventional cholecystectomy (75 min versus 95 min).	0.5207299633022928
However, surgical and nonsurgical complication rates were similar in both groups.	0.6582176575874349
The period of hospitalization was shorter in laparoscopic operations.	0.5346469706772468
According to these results we believe that laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis is a safe and effective procedure.	0.7165047777599758
The patients will benefit from the advantages of laparoscopic surgery without increased morbidity.	0.6226861945706431
The sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is one of the most striking developments in the treatment of melanoma.	0.7278180292612264
Since the first report by Morton et al.	0.551800678452912
in 1992, the method has been refined, and its use has increased.	0.8605525246496137
Introduced as an alternative to elective lymph node dissection (ELND), it has rapidly made its way into clinical practice.	0.6786643167582451
SLND allows precise pathologic staging through removal and analysis of a limited number of nodes (false-negative rate < 2 %).	0.5699590721504629
It distinguishes patients with clinically occult nodal disease from those with tumor-free regional basin who would not benefit from radical dissection.	0.5163456284638211
However, the SLND is still an experimental procedure with yet unproven utility.	0.575012859217885
Although children are injured everyday through accidents, road traffic, leisure or sports activities, internal lesions of the knee joint due to the trauma are rare.	0.5695389458137136

Traumatic internal lesions of the knee where analysed in 76 children up to age 16.	0.5927090179415261
The pattern of injury changed with increasing age, the trauma remaining the same.	0.5807525278422653
Most common where injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).	0.3440743616224988
Main cause where sports activities.	0.172751214819423
Operative treatment seems to be the appropriate treatment.	0.8499355736087391
Osseous avulsions of the cruciates and collateral ligaments showed good results after transosseous refixation with a suture.	0.3959152511532592

The publication of the CONSORT Statement was aimed at the improvement of the quality of research reports of randomized controlled clinical trials.	0.5762595129334206
It contains the most important standards of high quality research.	0.640875068370371
Although originally meant for randomized studies only most aspects of this statement can be applied to other kinds of clinical studies.	0.5376120750808736
The demand for minimally invasive techniques and more comfort for the patient is becoming higher and higher.	0.7264261262860039
In the region of the ankle joint, it is therefore ideal to use the arthroscope for pathology.	0.7303370128198933
Indications for ankle joint arthroscopy are: soft tissue impingement, ligament instability, impingement in the syndesmosis, osteochondral lesions, loose bodies, arthrosis, and loose os trigonum of the talus.	0.515930924639118
In the subtalar joint the indications are rupture of the ligaments, loose bodies, and synovitis with soft tissue impingement.	0.6076946033634542
A new indication is arthroscopically assisted arthrodesis of the talar and subtalar joint.	0.36118519349559064
The reported high incidence of complications, especially in terms of neurovascular lesions, can be avoided by an exact knowledge of anatomy and use of non-invasive distraction of the joint.	0.7908876039687438
Although alexithymia is found in patients with various somatic disorders, it remains unclear whether it is really related to organic disease - as proposed by the founders of the concept .[125].	0.707302035187277
As the interplay between the experience of emotion and possible adverse effects on health is a fundamental tenet of psychosomatic medicine, alexithymia remains an interesting concept to be further explored, especially concerning (1) possible pathways linking emotion to physical illness and (2) the neurobiologic basis of emotional information processing.	0.5926035360214071
Compared to the intense international discussion on the subject, in Germany there are still many doubts concerning alexithymia: while some clinicians question the validity of the whole concept, psychiatric and psychosomatic researchers seem unsure about alexithymia's role in their search for a physiological basis to the link between emotion and physical disease.	0.6509272145446959
Our review deals with the empirical literature concerning that possible association and tries to tie in their data with modern, neurobiologically founded insights into emotional information processing within the brain.	0.37109920027948595
In the etiopathology of tension type headache, vascular and autonomic disorders are discussed.	0.5477678686415077
Fifteen patients with chronic tension type headache according to the criteria of the IHS were investigated using the TCD-ergometer-test - a method used to evaluate the myogenic mechanism of cerebrovascular autoregulation - and the results were compared with the findings in fifteen healthy control subjects.	0.8438237234603667
An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on bone marrow biopsies in 604 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) to compare morphological and clinical features and to evaluate effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.	0.8265132884360042
Following morphometry significant correlations were calculated between number of CD61+ megakaryocytes, including their precursors with fiber density.	0.4458408799352129
This finding is in line with the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts regarding the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis.	0.37810215484894405
The latter was observed in about 28% of patients already at diagnosis.	0.7518504452907451
In a similar way, the frequency of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f+ nucleated erythroid precursors, implicating an involvement of this cell lineage in iron turnover, hemoglobin synthesis, and degradation of the expelled nuclei from normoblasts.	0.5498671799251996
The (-D-galactosyl residue-expressing) Pseudo-Gaucher cells were detectable in 30% of pretreatment specimens.	0.6909269625261272
Moreover, significant associations were calculable between reduction in erythropoiesis or increase in fibers with clinical features such as hemoglobin level, percentages of myelo- and erythroblasts in the peripheral blood, and spleen size.	0.5435322031553126
These variables are in keeping with more advanced stages of CML.	0.3975265971672381
Based on our morphometric evaluations, a classification into three different histological subgroups: granulocytic, megakaryocytic, and myelofibrotic was carried out.	0.6109891320554789
This simplified staging system was correlated with corresponding sets of hematological data.	0.3301094242097066
Sequential biopsies in 173 patients with monotherapy by IFN, hydroxyurea (HU), or busulfan (BU) revealed a fibrogenic effect of IFN in contrast to a fiber-reducing property of HU.	0.48962339712625874
The dynamics of myelofibrosis and changes of major cell lineages during treatment were readily demonstrable by calculating corresponding indices.	0.41086443016773916
These included the ratios between quantitative differences of corresponding variables at repeated examinations and time.	0.3003536832687507
Thus, in patients with complete hematological remission following IFN administration, regeneration of erythropoiesis was found to be accompanied by an increase in the total number of CD68+ macrophages, including activated subpopulations.	0.6663730231501429
Histological subgroups showed a transition from a (nonfibrotic) granulocytic and megakaryocyte pattern to the myelofibrotic subtype in about 40% of patients.	0.5692435338650581
This change was opposed to a numerical reduction in the myelofibrotic subtype which occurred in 17 patients (36%), but predominantly in those under HU therapy.	0.5656547848897407
In conclusion, the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow features in CML warrants a careful morphological evaluation of trephine biopsies and appropriate means of processing to achieve relevant correlations with clinical data and, thus, allows a more elaborate insight into the dynamics of the disease process.	0.6487174803933983
Computer-aided analysis of the results of the intrathecal infusion test using our mathematical computation leads to simplification of this investigation, and therefore normal pressure hydrocephalus is more easily diagnosed.	0.7438734335221091
Simultaneous measurement of resistance and compliance during a single investigation allows the exertion of the patients to be minimized.	0.6584665684362172
In contrast to classic methods it is not necessary that the ICP reaches a plateau.	0.6658254917498975
Our mathematical method diverges with the description of a pressure-dependent slope of the function for the resistance from the static examination models.	0.5223460698238767
For that we are able to take the non-linearity of the cerebrospinal fluid resorption into consideration.	0.4377691053837531
The intrathecal infusion test is a reliable diagnostic method for measuring resistance and compliance in patients suspected of having normal pressure hydrocephalus.	0.5721619838162199
Primary medullary nailing of femoral fractures is burdened by the risk of central and pulmonary complications in patients with polytrauma, especially in conjunction with craniocerebral or thoracic trauma.	0.5843607783334063
This also applies to unreamed medullary nailing.	0.19962346445206622

Plate osteosynthesis with anatomical repositioning of the fragments and rigid fixation is a technically demanding procedure, but can lead to fragment necrosis due to fragment denudation.	0.6805755232262756
In a prospective study conducted from 1 September 1994 to 30 June 1996 on 17 polytraumatized patients (average ISS: 30 points), simple femoral stem fractures (A-1 to B-3 of the AO-classification) were stabilized by elastic plate osteosynthesis using biological technique.	0.6653532297890346
While cautiously preserving the periosteal and muscle connections to the bone, a plate is inserted as a bridge without any interfragmentary compression.	0.4856678442643638
At least two to four holes are left free in the center of the plate.	0.5115764188249589

It is not clear whether public health insurance will cover post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), whereby the question of costs being covered by private health insurance companies is not taken into consideration here.	0.5653044491286388
Regulations concerning prevention (§ 20 SGB V), precautionary medical services (§ 23 SGB V) and health examination (§ 25 SBG V) offer no legal basis for cost coverage.	0.6058991919660789
PEP is patient care in the sense of § 27 SGB V. However, this particular treatment has not yet been adapted into public health insurance financial guidelines because the federal committees have not yet made appropriate recommendations.	0.5772473630782373
This should be achieved soon, in order to eliminate legal ambiguities in this area.	0.5371697583512909
The principles of the so called "new methods of examination and treatment" legal construct may support cost coverage liability.	0.6756204791451003
On the whole, however, German-Austrian recommendations concerning indication and use of PEP must be formulated more concretely and unambiguously.	0.4616504912929518
If a doctor, in the case of an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, does not prescribe PEP, this would probably not be malpractice, because there are still many scientific questions to be answered.	0.8327057087212323
To clarify the functional mechanism of the Esmarch device in the treatment of sleep apnea, its effect on muscle activity during sleep was studied electromyographically with and without the appliance at the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle, the genioglossal muscle, and the masseter muscle in 15 patients with sleep apnea syndrome.	0.7460675888593002
During the obstructive apnea the muscles showed significantly lower amplitudes than before the apnea.	0.38782892321312185
No significant decrease in the amplitude was observed during the central apnea, but, after the obstructive and central apnea, significantly higher amplitudes were seen than beforehand.	0.7502870013941215
The amplitudes rose after the placement of the appliance, and the amplitudes of the genioglossal and lateral pterygoid muscles during obstructive apnea increased significantly after the insertion of the appliance.	0.6353819602824332
The results suggest that the device can activate the masticatory and tongue muscle activity and indicate that the muscles activated with the appliance can prevent obstruction in the oropharynx.	0.5253237430817184
The Esmarch device not only helps avoid obstruction by mandibular protraction, but also affects function by activating the muscles.	0.48872238685597175

The prevalence in paediatric obesity is increasing in many industrialised and developing countries and growing to a world-wide medical and socio-economic problem.	0.41896953769446416
In a recent report of the WHO the world-wide epidemic of obesity was addressed as a problem of highest priority.	0.5703928549516697
Inadequate long-term results of weight reduction in children and adolescents and the increasing socio-economic burden to the health systems, as well as the high grade of persistence of obesity aggravate the problem and demand primary prevention efforts.Future directions of primary prevention measures could be the time of onset of obesity, the "early adiposity rebound", intrauterine malnutrition, weight gain during infancy, low energy expenditure in infants, familial adiposity, composition of food and modification of fat intake.	0.6515425091129023
Despite advances in the field of orthopedic surgery, necrosis of the femoral head still remains a serious problem.	0.5105860671225175
Under normal conditions magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) is the gold standard for early diagnosis.	0.732581071303904
Because of magnetic interference, this technique is not applicable in the diagnosis of posttraumatic necrosis with internal fixation, however.	0.7789245453659418
This seems to be an ideal indication for ossovenography: contrast medium is injected into the femoral head under X-ray control and the venous flow is documented.	0.7435842670386583
Furthermore, it is possible to get histological samples from suspicious areas.	0.5984654658070016
Ossovenography was performed in 12 patients and the results were compared with histological samples.	1.052327929901137
In every patient in whom necrosis of the femoral head was diagnosed by ossovenography (91.6 %), we also found necrosis on histological examination.	0.7079443099808537
In one patient in whom physiological flow was found, there was a corresponding absence of necrosis in the histological sample.	0.72609943076151
There were no complications during ossovenography.	0.682531290740057
The results suggest that ossovenography is a promising and reliable method for early diagnosis of necrosis of the femoral head in the presence of internal fixation devices.	0.6797488596555791
To evaluate patients with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death the analysis of ventricular late potentials, heart rate variability and baroreflexsensitivity is helpful.	0.6612994999904414
However, the prediction of malignant arrhythmic events cannot be performed with sufficient accuracy.	0.6471875933561186
For a better identification of high risk patients other methods are necessary.	0.623667666471814
In this study the impact of the chemoreflexsensitivity for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was investigated.	0.6734437361869701
The results of a retrospective study concerning percutaneous catheter drainage of 62 intra-abdominal abscesses in 60 patients were demonstrated, including the procedure and complications.	0.7975368835793166
For the first access a thin needle was used to perform an aspiration biopsy under sonographic control.	0.6418712954737358
We placed a pigtail or van Sonnenberg catheter by Seldinger or trocar technique into the abscesses.	0.21431730847344155
The primary success rate of percutaneous drainage was 85 %.	0.5032751424022338
Complications occurred in 6.4 % of the cases with a mortality of 0 %.	0.9138059142717067
This method is an acceptable alternative to surgery for many patients.	0.5668493787775551
Ultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter drainage is the method of choice for uncomplicated abscesses, especially in the critically ill patient.	0.6721765477408885
Acute brain tissue damage or systemic illnesses can lead to local or diffuse brain edema and raised intracranial pressure (ICP).	0.49396611249272204
It is obvious that in all brain injuries additional factors (metabolic disturbances, hypoxia and hypercapnia, circulatory instability) aggravating brain edema and impairing recovery of viable neurons have to be treated immediately and consequently.	0.5201740411327996
Medical therapies for further treatment of elevated ICP depend not only on their mode of action and side effects but although on the specific illness.	0.6194526693652856
The different etiology and pathogenesis of developing brain edema and ICP elevation with either more local or generalized extension explain the different success of medical treatment strategies in severe head trauma compared to middle cerebral artery territory or complete hemispheric infarction.	0.555043937507309
An algorithm for treatment of postischemic brain edema in acute hemispheric infarction was developed.	0.5388932315569328
In an investigation of infection control methods for respirator systems in 89 randomly selected German intensive care units as a part of the NIDEP study (Nosocomial Infections in Germany - Surveillance and Prevention), it was found that respirator systems were exchanged daily in about 50% of the intensive care units.	0.6742711231968511
However, Craven et al.	0.29784544579070343
found that changing circuits (including tubing and exhalation valve and the attached humidifier) every 24 h rather than every 48 h was independently associated with the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia.	0.5321838478364579
On the basis of these results and recent studies, the current situation in the literature was analyzed in order to make recommendations for exchanging ventilator circuits.	0.8233796549417404
The key function of the uterine cervix to maintain pregnancy is biochemically characterized by an increased synthesis of proteins (e.g., collagen), proteoglycans, and glycoproteins (e.g., fibronectin) as well as by well-defined interactions between these components of the extracellular matrix.	0.6009764167320919
In contrast to the slow phase of the cervical ripening process in late pregnancy, dilatation of the cervix during parturition requires the rapid formation and action of catabolic enzyme systems, leading mainly to collagen degradation and changes in its architecture but also to degradation of other fundamental matrix proteins.	0.6017551105611332
It has been suggested that an increased production of tumor necrosis factor- and interleukin-1, for example, induces an increased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules with subsequent extravasation of granulocytes in the cervical stroma and that the chemotaxis and degranulation of these cells within the stroma is triggered by an increase in interleukin-8 concentration.	0.6300656430223409
The proteases (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase-8) released after degranulation of neutrophilic granulocytes encounter an already destabilized (loss of decorin) collagenous fiber network.	0.35695946079937196
The clinical consequences of this basic research is to develop new concepts in a more causal treatment of cervical pathology during pregnancy and parturition.	0.5938246595005193

The rational of this study was to show that retroviral transduction of human osteoblastic cells is possible in vitro using the marker gene LacZ and the potentially therapeutic gene encoding for human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1Ra).	0.5819527253256225
Different transduction techniques were combined to improve the rate of transduction in vitro.	0.5290087903316537
Methods: Osteoblastic cells were isolated from human spongious bone and cultured in vitro.	0.4457864635595767
The -galactosidase (LacZ) gene and the cDNA of IL-1Ra were introduced into the isolated cells by retrovirus mediated gene transfer.	0.5297358793153919
LacZ activity was determined by Xgal staining, IL-1Ra was measured quantitatively by ELISA.	0.4687700726329638
Results: The transfer of retroviral IL-1Ra led to IL-1Ra expression of 8614 to 10089pg IRAP/50000 cells/48h.	0.5488447394018491
By combining different techniques to improve transduction, the X-gal staining established a rate of transduction of 60%.	0.5645977336724239

We report a 72-year-old patient who developed an isolated bilateral hypoglossal nerve paralysis following head trauma with complete recovery after three months.	0.6545660118493786
Since the CT scan did not show any fractures of the posterior skull base, we discuss a traction nerve injury as a possible mechanism.	0.8121757222912502
Injuries of the colon and retroperitoneum are rarely observed after blunt abdominal trauma and occur in about 5 - 20 % of the patients.	0.7292501623187152
The majority of complications are due to initial misdiagnoses and a delay in treatment.	0.4737985824645569
Lesions of the pancreas and duodenum are the most frequent diagnoses in the retroperitoneal space, while major vascular traumata or urogenital injuries are rare.	0.7265892514405903
Retroperitoneal hematoma are most likely due to pelvic fractures.	0.38449363653923063
The survival of patients after colon or retroperitoneal injuries depends on the severity of concomitant organ trauma, the time of diagnosis, and a situation-adapted therapeutic strategy.	0.8608578888267571
The treatment of the typical caudal retroperitoneal hematoma following pelvic fractures is conservative in most patients.	0.5647141902689349
Early pelvic stabilization, e. g., with external fixation, is recommended in these patients.	0.7034494792021998
Central retroperitoneal hematoma in the supra - or inframesocolic space should be treated surgically, as major vascular injuries are most likely in these patients.	0.7786965597314953
Duodenal or pancreatic injuries need surgical exploration in the majority of patients; the therapeutic spectrum ranges from simple sutures to pancreatoduodenal resection.	0.5599102785302895
The treatment of colon injuries depends on the degree of peritonitis and the severity of concomitant trauma.	0.5141394912967918
Early diagnosed injuries are suitable for primary repair, while deviation stomata or a Hartmann procedure with or without resection should be offered to patients with delayed diagnoses, peritonitis, or severe concomitant diseases.	0.6056607774537865
Long-lasting procedures should be abandoned in the emergency situation; in these severe cases, laparotomy should be aimed towards primary "damage control" and followed by definite surgery after stabilization of the patient.	0.7533147152079737
Surgery of the great veins inevitably began with the surgical treatment of injuries, often involving the femoral vein.	0.7382695168862421
Because of the famous case presented by Roux in 1813, the prevailing opinion until almost the end of the nineteenth century was that ligation of the vein made death inevitable, but that the only way to control severe hemorrhaging from a vein was to ligate the femoral artery.	0.5476718278299193
Zaufal's principle (1880) consisted in the ligation and resection of great veins of the body and limbs in order to prevent sepsis in suppurative processes.	0.5618316145451446
This surgical method was still being used in the first half of the twentieth century in patients with perforated appendicitis or puerperal fever.	0.6631943245076944
In the limb, the congestion induced in the vein had a positve effect on the healing process.	0.5948479830108039
The surgical treatment of leg and pelvic deep vein thrombosis was initially (1931) aimed at achieving decompression in compartment syndromas.	0.4795851443434568
The first thrombectomy was performed in 1937, but several operations with a successful outcome were reported at the 61st annual meeting of the German Society of Surgery in the following year.	0.7755781494142697
Bilateral glomus jugulare tumors are rare.	0.3322836828086569
However, their treatment should preserve not only the function of the facial nerve but also the caudal cranial nerves and the middle ears in order to avoid bilateral hearing losses.	0.6928715895522963
Further, venous cerebral drainage has to be ensured in order to avoid cerebral hypertension and hemorrhagic infarction after bilateral jugular ligations.	0.5026068341759783
In the case presented bilateral glomus jugulare tumors required super-selective angiography and embolization.	0.5822486240229849
Complete tumor removal on both sides was then possible by a transmastoid-transcervical approach without any further functional deteriorations.	0.4653990957148495
Middle ear function was preserved on both sides by temporary ventral translocation of the posterior wall of the auditory meatus.	0.5815381706620636
As the sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein had been ligated during initial previous surgery, venous drainage was tested one year later by angiography and compression of the remaining internal jugular vein.	0.57625047132565
A sufficient collateral circulation was found and permitted surgery on the second side.	0.4597449580920408
Intoxication is the monotone reaction of the CNS to consumed psychoactive substances.	0.4218918503765824
Intoxication-like conditions may also occur without taking drugs.	0.44526928890005274
We then use the term "ecstasy".	0.2834913059548824
Intoxication can follow typical or atypical course.	0.19869276411745385
The main symptoms are disturbances of consciousness and orientation and additionally changes of mood, affect, drive and initiative, train of thought and self-control.	0.4724322561297446
The diagnosis of intoxication differs from the diagnosis of psychosis because the latter continues its own course, occurs in the absence of psychoactive substances in the organism and always lasts longer than an intoxication.	0.4809629510553132
In a meta-analysis of 69 prospective and retrospective studies, we investigated the value of various surgical techniques in the treatment of lumbar disk herniations.	0.7096885495070222
Androgenetic hair loss is the most frequent reason for the topical application of hair-growth-promoting agents.	0.6366272202088935
Such preparations should arrest or even reverse androgen-induced hair follicle regression as well as prolonging the hair cycles, especially of the shortened anagen phase, and thus protect from increased hair loss.	0.5357609663004584
True evidence of drug effects on hair growth is problematic, since trichograms, the method chiefly applied by the manufacturers, fail to reveal every factor involved in the follicular activity, especially the duration of anagen stage.	0.6905566192329302
For example, an increase in the anagen rate does not always reflect a lengthening of the anagen stage, but may also be due to shortened hair cycles.	0.720980618183581
Accordingly, drug effects on hair growth should be investigated by methods that analyse the cell cycle kinetics.	0.5879294460454874
For this approach DNA-flowcytometry of the outer root sheath in plucked anagen hairs and of complete anagen hair bulbs taken by micropreparative techniques from scalp biopsies offers a reproducible method for quick and reliable evaluation of hair growth.	0.3631084222886439
The calcaneus pseudathrosis is rarly seen in clinical workday and we coundnit find any case be reported.	0.3262160205304966
In two casese the authors present the diagnosis and therapie of a non-union after a calcaneus fracture.	0.5667288704536536
The authors point especially at anatomical characteristics and biomechanical reasons and their meaning for aetiology of pseudathrosis after a calcaneus fracture.	0.3717800369485867
A general review of the results and technique of intraarterial chemotherapy in cases of breast cancer is given.	0.8219348214678462
The remission rate for untreated primary tumors is nearly 100%, for completely treated local relapses approximately 70%.	0.5392554663856653
The complication rate is quite low using an intraarterial well-tolerated cytostatic agent such as mitoxantrone.	0.46300391716659006
However, thromboembolism of the vertebral artery facing the internal mammary artery may occur.	0.5138035050549704
The indication for intraarterial chemotherapy should always be set by an interdisciplinary board.	0.5023442331863676
In the country city of Ansbach, Germany all cases of varicella-zoster virus infection seen by dermatologists, pediatricians and general practitioneers were registered over a period of 16 months, from February 1992 until May 1993.	0.5372605188286458
152 patients were clinically diagnosed with herpes zoster and 437 patients with chickenpox.	0.3763189471643563
The population-based incidence of zoster infections was 22.6 per 10,000 inhabitants per year, while the incidence of chickenpox was 42.4.	0.5925503725229581
There was a slight predominance of male patients with zoster.	0.5883679239449602
There was also a marked influence of age and sex, on the localization of the involved nerve segments.	0.7562898070839184
Zoster was seen in patients of all ages but there was a clear predominance in older patients.	0.7601387935849571
The peak of the disease occurred in the eighth decade.	0.8092843178483847
In patients with chickenpox, the sex ratio was equal.	0.6246365007234259
The disease typically occurs in children and we observed a predominance of the cases in the first decade.	0.9562224610836585
Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNS) are rare disorders of the nervous system that cannot be ascribed to metatastases or to destruction of vital systemic organs by the tumor or its treatment.	0.5666379485359269
Most frequently, PNS occur in association with small-cell lung, breast or ovarian carcinomas.	0.48486207933335557
The most frequent PNS is Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which at the same time has the highest predictive value concerning an underlying carcinoma.	0.6107667568165203
PNS have been classified mostly under anatomical aspects but now are increasingly categorized according to specific antibodies.	0.37319073685207127
In certain neurologic syndromes (sensible and autonomic neuropathy, cerebellitis, limbic encephalitis, Opsoclonus-Myoclonus syndrome, Stiff-man syndrome, neuromyotonia, subacute amaurosis) specific autoantibodies are highly predictive for a neoplasm.	0.45833371114072313
Pathogenic relevance of these autoantibodies has been demonstrated only for antibodies against (1) voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, (2) voltage gated potassium channels (VGKC) in neuromyotonia, and (3) recoverin in cancer associated retinopathy.	0.6010310190168656
The present article deals with the neurological symptoms of PNS, associated tumors, and the relevance of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and pathogenesis of PNS.	0.8412756755034512
Ewing's sarcoma is a very rare tumor which has, however, attracted much oncological interest since the dramatic improvement of its prognosis under chemotherapy.	0.4351654560332163
Its histogenesis has been discussed controversially for a long time, including a possible origin in immature reticulum, myogenous, endothelial and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells.	0.6456243954921866
Repeated reports have also suggested a possible neuroectodermal genesis.	0.34871471956173256
Convincing arguments, however, have only been brought forward during recent years, since it was found that Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor share a common chromosome translocation 11;22.	0.6089468365095235
In the meantime this hypothesis has been strengthened by numerous cell biological analyses.	0.4270759218077766
There seems to be no clear border between Ewing's sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumors with definite neural differentiation.	0.4800386783494594
Histological differential diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma has been improved by immunohistological methods.	0.4593151981825036
In most cases, they can be distinguished from lymphoma (leucocyte common antigen, B and T markers) and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (muscle specific actin, desmin) without problems.	0.7129916566149687
Apart from that, it is possible nowadays to obtain antibodies against the MIC 2-protein, which is preferably expressed in Ewing sarcoma.	0.7239809083840975
The diagnostics of Ewing's sarcoma and the malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor have considerably been enriched by the fact that the specific chromosome translocation t(11;22) can be proved molecular biologically.	0.5058693716532608
In contrast to the cytogenetic evidence, it is not necessary to establish cell cultures.	0.8307361812925846
Contrast enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance angiography affords angiographic depiction of extended vascular territories with high quality and diagnostic value.	0.4396598812705599
A prerequisite is the fast acquisition of a three-dimensional gradient-echo data set during the injection of a bolus of a T1-shortening contrast agent.	0.5141457983105938
We describe the dependence of the quality of CE-MRA on technical parameters of different MR-scanners and consider some fundamental facts and practical guidelines concerning the contrast agent injection.	0.4766766647605307
The present study gives a survey of radiological findings after surgical treatment of laryngeal and pharyngeal carcinomas, whereby the surgical procedures and the localisation of tumours found special consideration.	0.6628212681822719
Owing to advances in adjuvant therapy, the outlook for patients with primary malignant bone tumors has improved dramatically in recent decades.	0.5872237728734621
This applies both to improved survival and to increased limb salvage rates.	0.4590335881688209
The diagnostic strategies and a staging system for malignant bone tumors are outlined.	0.6579817470224825
Technical aspects of the standard limb salvage procedures, such as Tikhoff-Linberg resection at the shoulder, internal hemipelvectomy, proximal and distal femur resection and rotation plasty are presented.	0.5343294115998956
The use of soft tissue procedures such as flaps and the use of modular implant systems has reduced the complication rates of limb salvage procedures.	0.5056911820441796
In the future we hope to further improve prognosis and quality of life for such patients by the application of risk-adapted strategies for chemotherapy and surgery.	0.6758373557805101
In 10-30 % of cases, locoregional recurrence is accompanied by distant metastasis; a further 25 % develop distant metastasis within the year after diagnosis of recurrence.	0.6700166211704848
In treatment of recurrent tumor in the thoracic wall, axillary or supraclavicular disease surgery plays a major role.	0.6079981657391793
Since - another long-lasting courses occur even in the metastatic situation, recurrence is not an infrequent event, and therapy then needs a multidisciplinary approach.	0.7472829888890976
Surgical techniques such as local, myocutaneous or omental flaps and mesh graft transplantation are used to cover large defects after tumor resection.	0.4781451308713522
Additional and innovative modalities are combined in the management of this complex problem: locoregional or systemic chemotherapy, topical application of chemotherapy, certain radiation regimens and in otherwise resistant tumors the experimental use of photodynamic laser therapy (PDT).	0.49408260882281696
The most important goal hereby is to restore or at least maintain organ function and quality of life.	0.5833034538120093
In acute osteomyelitis of childhood a rapid diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic therapy is necessary in order to prevent late sequelae.	0.5956296648906384
Thus, diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role.	0.5495765984451545
If acute osteomyelitis is suspected in a child, imaging starts with conventional radiography in order to exclude other differential diagnoses.	0.5434710913103933
This is followed by sonography for the purpose of diagnosing a subperiosteal abscess or joint fluid from which the causative organism could be isolated.	0.4568376762142703
If the diagnosis is unclear, the next step should be either MRI or 99m Tc-MDP bone scan, depending on the possibility of clinical localization and the site of the suspected lesion.	0.6513677078593176
MRI is superior to bone scan in depicting the exact anatomy, which is extremely important in spinal osteomyelitis and preoperatively.	0.6283169710896838
The bone scan can show the whole skeleton in one examination and should be favored if there is no definite localization or in suspected multifocal osteomyelitis.	0.5180536891967618
Rarely scintigraphy with labeled white blood cells is indicated.	0.31359994883626674
The 67 Ga scan, however, should not be used in children because of the high level of radiation exposure.	0.8216927569989361
The different imaging modalities are described in detail and an imaging diagnostic workup is outlined.	0.588696772992151
In spite of all interdisciplinary efforts and functionally oriented operation procedures, there are still unsatisfying results in the treatment of cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients.	0.6148098569679333
Secondary corrections involve upper lip, nose, and palate (fissures).	0.4617252350454615
In some cases, it is necessary to reposition the complete maxilla.	0.6457867229936444
Finally, there are indications for speech improving measures and total septorhinoplasties.	0.6636488538908515
Dental treatment can be brought to a positive end by means of implant-borne prosthodontic work.	0.5606403632570616
In this paper, some of the anatomical and physiologic conditions and surgical procedures are described, which may serve as a basis for a functionally orientated treatment of sequelae after primary CLP care.	0.8396763315565327
Damage to the respiratory system caused by inhalation of toxic products of combustion and the subsequent development of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the main lethal factors in burns patients.	0.6349540721661469
Treatment with exogenous surfactant is one of the therapeutic options.	0.6121495998517639
However, no clinical reports have yet been published about this therapy.	0.6109709418914829
We report on two patients with burn injuries of second to third degree affecting 42% and 48% respectively of the total body surface plus inhalation injury complicated by ARDS.	0.6343225385303316
Both patients were treated with bovine surfactant (Alveofact).	0.5615552071131517
The therapeutic effects on oxygenation and pulmonary function were monitored.	0.5237812557706323
Intrabronchial application of surfactant by bronchoscopy during exhaustive conventional mechanical ventilation resulted in improved gas exchange with an increase in arterial O2 pressure (paO2); inspired O2 concentration (FiO2) was lowered and there was an improvement in lung compliance.	0.5416538367131261
Both patients survived this critical situation.	0.27644811786120577
We conclude that treatment with exogenous surfactant in postburn victims with ARDS is a promising therapeutic approach to improve the survival rate of these high-risk patients.	0.6937686942646321
The main aesthetic concern of patients with Angle class II deformities with skeletal deep bite - short face syndrome - is the short lower face.	0.7068429402457215
It is the orthodontist's task to correct this deformity insofar as possible.	0.4303273539408341
Depending on the extent, even orthodontists at the beginning of their training will recognize this.	0.6514145533918716
Since presurgical orthodontic treatment determines the kind and extent of the surgical procedure, the orthodontist has to plan the treatment in for individual case .	0.6187258807941012
It is the purpose of this article to demonstrate a concept of treatment for patients with class II deformities, skeletal deep bite, and a short lower face.	0.9489938357120781
Presurgical orthodontic treatment and the surgical procedure to correct the deformity are discussed.	0.8497004823696648
The treatment results show that it is necessary to leave or to create a certain curve of Spee, depending on the extent of the deformity, to achieve a satisfactory result in terms of to function, aesthetics, and stability.	0.7412866185166548
It can be concluded that it is only possible to reach the preset treatment goals with an exact diagnosis and the knowledge of the necessary preparation in combination with the surgical procedure.	0.8237052643723789
Adequate psychotherapeutic treatment of transsexual patients during the "real- life-test" is crucial for the outcome after sex reassignement surgery.	0.7044585972110028
Necessary modifications are discussed along the concept of "transsexual defense" and the interrelation of identity and disordered gender identity.	0.589387271024638
Usually therapeuts of transsexual patients, who decide over somatic sex reassignement, have to engage also in psychotherapy in a broad sense.	0.6327279427002774
Within the setting of the "administrative-psychotherapeutic split" the psychotherapist leaves the decision over admission to sex reassignement to a therapist specialised in gender identity disorders.	0.42263421544931723
In this setting patients have more time to develop insight and have better chances to explore other options and find individual solutions with regard to irreversible sex reassignement surgery.	0.41547426021947287
During recent years in the German federal social welfare system has been subject to several changes due to structural forms.	0.6079025216692449
The hospital sector - as an element of this system - has also been affected.	0.8750304635619466
Based on various legislation the financial framework has been reduced which has led to tendencies of economic limitation and rationalization.	0.3944237132957483
From this background considerable risk selection and changes in emphasis might result.	0.3785613714256103
Cost intensive patients with a high need for treatment are referred as quickly as possible and dicharged to outpatient services despite unknown domestic follow-up care.	0.5978922500796707
Mostly the elderly are affected.	0.3937470629802156
Medical rehabilitation can be found in this system at the cut between SGB V and SGB XI.	0.5718510404839351
However, this division raises problems and discussions concerning benefit payment (rehabilitation before nursing, priority of home, etc.).	0.4392524615397106
Right in rehabilitation the most important thing is an overlap of sectors.	0.4487451239295751
Various medical, nursing and other social supplies have to be put into a network to achieve an integral treatment of patients that focuses on the individual situation.	0.6260780069699959
In 1995 the Ethics Commission of the Medical University of Lübeck was asked to rule on whether a preimplantation diagnostic procedure (PID) could be performed on a husband and wife who were both carriers of the cystic fibrosis mutation  F508.	0.547165236349196
The couple had previously given birth to a child with cystic fibrosis and had twice terminated a pregnancy following prenatal screening.	0.4190449799299417
Ethically, the performance of a PID was certainly warranted for this couple.	0.5273317108166122
The risk of violating §§8 Section 1 and/or 2 Section 1 ("totipotent cells shall not be removed for diagnostic purposes") of the Law for the Protection of Embryos (ESchG) was judged to be nonexistent in written statements from two expert witnesses (Prof. K.V.	0.5997893607374939
Hinrichsen and Prof. H.M. Beier, both embryologists).	0.4931147268307508
In the view of the Ethics Commission, only §1 Section 2 ("an ovum shall be fertilized only for the purpose of inducing pregnancy") of the ESchG currently prohibits PIDs.	0.7110665142482109
In light of the social and biological arguments in favor of PIDs, however, the Ethics Commission questioned whether this section of the ESchG is still morally justifiable.	0.6147633316675916
A 38 year old male patient with a coarctation of the aorta was successfully operated using an ascending aorta-abdominal aorta bypass (AAAAB).	0.6018410165357558
The diagnosis of a severe postisthmic stenosis had been confirmed by aortography.	0.6348639854204254
Preoperatively the patient suffered from extreme hypertension and claudicatio intermittens.	0.3457997728453323
After prosthetic repair of coarctation, blood pressure became normotensive and claudicatio intermittens disappeared.	0.45477579496495635
In this report, we discuss various surgical techniques and the most important question concerning the optimal timing of surgical repair of aortic coarctation.	0.8502961461518426
Iatrogenic colonic perforation is a rare but very dangerous complication of colonoscopy.	0.5703870364660508
We report on eleven prospectivly recorded patients treated between 1994 and 1998.	0.572794862770083
In seven cases the colonoscopy had been done for diagnostic and in four cases for therapeutic reason.	0.575084300480754
Nine women and two men (age range 56 to 92 years) were affected.	0.6626580752975415
In 77 % the perforation was found in the sigmoid colon.	0.7353586793730738
All patients were operated on and five sutures, five resections and one colostomy were performed.	0.5688941418561753
No significant differences could be shown in six patients with classical perforation compared with five patients presenting with prolonged abdominal pain.	0.6957776039815189
Only duration of symptoms was significantly different in the two groups.	0.5168769288786742
Three patients (85, 90 and 92 years) died from late complications.	0.6862512639799605
Indications of MR arthrography were analyzed in this prospective study.	0.4681355974480592
The aim was to evaluate possible advantages over conventional MRI, establish diagnostic criteria and to analyze its meaning further for the therapeutic management of postoperative patients.	0.6977771406003279
Nerve fibre-neuroendocrine cell complexes (NF-NEC-C's) are neuroendocrine cells located in the lamina propria of the gastrointestinal tract directly connected with nerve fibres of Meissner's plexus.	0.4507348739485194
We report on a patient with sporadic Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with electron microscopically demonstrated multiple NF-NEC-C's in non-antral gastric mucosa.	0.5005394161064194
It is suspected that in ZES the hypergastrinaemia may represent a trophic stimulus for the proliferation of NF-NEC-C's in the gastric mucosa.	0.41748901505643016
Introduction: The prehospitaly initiated endotracheal intubation and controlled ventilation, is especially in multi-system-trauma cases, recognized to be the "gold standard".	0.6509635459079505
Thus especially in view of the increasing demands being placed upon the quality of prehospital emergency treatment in general, the quality of such prehospital induced ventilation, is becoming of increasing importance.	0.6432747294884344
Thereby we must take into consideration the limited possabilities, which are afflicted with a high degree of uncertainess, which we have at our disposal to effectively evaluate the efficiency of emergency ventilation.	0.7328653654417073
The purpose of our study within a collective of severely traumatized patients, was to determine the quality of prehospitaly induced ventilation with regards to the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation and as a result of our findings, to identify areas for procedural optimization.	0.7085915377312099
Staging of any tumor, i.e.	0.28924856967258095
determination of the extent of the disease, serves to select the patients who might profit from curative surgical intervention or to define those patients with inoperable carcinomas who should be referred for other therapies, such as chemotherapy or irradiation.	0.6147349354604118
Furthermore, accurate staging is necessary for assessment of prognosis, for radiation therapy planning, and for differentiation of those with small-cell lung cancer or for follow-up examinations of small-cell lung cancer patients after during and after chemotherapy.	0.8133187760832351

Based on the results of chromosome analysis from cell cultures and testis biopsies, the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in infertile men is up to 20%.	0.6570010427440445
Chromosomal analysis from peripheral blood cultures is a routine procedure while the analysis of meiotic chromosomes is labor intensive and mainly used in a scientific setting.	0.5221835330427608
Of all infertile males, 7-9% show numerical and/or structural chromosomal abnormalities in their peripheral blood lymphocytes.	0.5548234320722485
There is an inverse correlation between sperm count and the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities, with 21% of patients with non-obstructive azoospermia having a chromosomal abnormality, most often Klinefelter's syndrome.	0.723695186109283
The rate of patients with chromosomal abnormalities is only 9% in patients with severe oligozoospermia (less than 5 million/ml), and structural abnormalities are found more often in this group.	0.7563986786247704
Using fluorescence in situ analysis the number of selected chromosomes can be assayed in single sperm cells.	0.3605136156346785
There is no consensus on whether infertile men have a higher proportion of aneuploid (disomic) sperm cells than fertile men.	0.5082391624033383
Taking into account the results from meiotic studies in infertile men, an increased rate of aneuploid sperm cells is likely.	0.6475648403808814
Chromosomal analysis should be performed on all infertile men being treated with ICSI as the result of this analysis could have important consequences in their reproductive decisions.	0.6007744034140128

Forty-one patients demonstrating clinical symptoms for cerebral infarction were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI).	0.5773710246680357
In 8 patients only DWI showed the cerebral lesions clearly.	0.4801857497477657
One patient with positive DWI and T2WI suffered from HSV encephalitis.	0.43294252551699425
DWI is superior to T2WI in assessment of small cortical infarcts and cerebral infarction in patients with preexisting vascular lesions.	0.4784083387065445
DWI is not specific, so other causes like cerebral hematoma and encephalitis have to be considered.	0.5608446147537145
Juvenile polyposis was first described by Cronkhite and Canada in 1955.	0.4262127223822749
This disease is characterized by juvenile intestinal polyps and ectodermal abnormalities.	0.3385737218822969
The etiology of Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS), however, is still not well understood.	0.6710756008401428
Interestingly, among patients with CCS a significant correlation (16.5 %) with intestinal carcinomas has been observed.	0.6991450995051517
Thus, malignant transformation and/or genetic predisposition may be involved in the initiation of the disease.	0.6721124224189716
In the following, epidemiology, symptoms, morphology and therapy of CCS are discussed.	0.6463526290109225

The pathogenesis of this histopathologically uncharacteristic lesion is unknown.	0.4101746243391089
In contrast to peri- or postoperative pacemaker infections, physical irritation can be considered a possible triggering mechanism.	0.8196090647205061
Allergic reactions to the implanted material have been ruled out by negative patch test results.	0.4630915991230517
The present legal requirements for the prescription of controlled drugs remains an impediment to adequate therapy for chronic pain because of an abundance of legal regulations.	0.5113516695667945
The physician prescribing opioids must consider the permitted maximum amount per prescription, the period of time the drug is prescribed for, numerous cross references, and other special regulations, and he still cannot be sure that he does not violate certain legal requirements.	0.6009542984243555
Often these difficulties result in withholding necessary pain treatment!	0.22297755751185128
In the authors' opinion it should be sufficient to write a specific prescription form for controlled drugs in the same way as any other ordinary prescription without jeopardizing the safety of the drug control system.	0.6405891580999817
It is important that the use of the narcotic be justified in the sense of § 13 Abs.	0.5764421079953432
1 of the drug control regulation, as judged by the responsible prescriber of the drug, and that any offence be punished.	0.868975210540028
The use of triplicate prescriptions guarantees sufficient proof.	0.26778305012294956
Legislation is requested that will substitute for the present drug control regulations, which are difficult to handle.	0.7406474391231164
The aim of the study was to investigate the ability to activate the quadriceps femoris muscle voluntarily in patients after severe knee injuries and it's influence on muscle function.	0.6535027144754145
33 male patients after ACL-rupture with concomitant injuries were investigated with a twitch-interpolation-method to determine the maximal voluntary contraction force (MVC) and the ability to activate the quadriceps muscle voluntarily.	0.6222792986051457
The results were compared to a previously investigated group of patients after isolated ACL-rupture and to an aged-matched control group.	0.7579884523922034
Managed care, i.e., the integration of health insurance and delivery of care under the direction of one organization, is gaining importance in the USA health market.	0.7001476553897734
The initial effects consisted of a decrease in insurance premiums, a very attractive feature for employers.	0.5614298924426091
Managed care promises to contain expenditures for health care.	0.2921500352662715
Given the shrinking public resources in Germany, managed care seems attractive for the German health system, too.	0.3939599245656442
In this review the development of managed care, the principal elements, forms of organisation and practical tools are outlined.	0.6379512416111986
The regulation of the delivery of care by means of controlling and financial incentives threatens the autonomy of physicians: the physician must act as a "double agent", caring for the interest for the individual patient and being restricted by the contract with the managed care organisation.	0.5965696845835754
Cost containment by managed care was achieved by reducing the fees for physicians and hospitals (and partly by restricting care for patients).	0.5403489395873959
Only a fraction of this cost reduction was handed over to the enrollee or employer, and most of the money was returned with profit to the shareholders of the managed care organisations.	0.4746254762200396
The preeminent role of primary care physicians as gatekeepers of the health network led to a reduced demand for specialist services in general and for university hospitals and anesthesiologists in particular.	0.5297273241228228
The paradigm of managed care, i.e., to guide the patient and the care giver through the health care system in order to achieve cost-effective and high quality care, seems very attractive.	0.7220621913477241
The stress on cost minimization by any means in the daily practice of managed care makes it doubtful if managed care should be an option for the German health system, in particular because there are a number of restrictions on it in German law.	0.6489000879899358
Background: Analysis of the impact of head fractures, intracranial hemorrhages, brain edema, and prognostic risk factors on long-term outcome in children with severe head injury.	0.7472819503900588
Background: In the past, the main problem of transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was related to the energy dosage of the individual effect.	0.9201764917446394
Since the target tissue is not directly observable, no information about the coagulation process was available to the surgeon.	0.6096351427288834
High inter- and intraindividual variations of the tissue properties often led to under- or overdosage.	0.7649080495916765
Underdosage is therapeutically useless, while overdosage causes the so-called "popeffects" which may induce severe damage to the eye.	0.5870799922875342
In the past, most scientific or routine studies on heart rate variability (HRV) were done using commercial Holter ECG devices with traditional magnetic tapes.	0.5796421172179985
All methods to calculate parameters of HRV are based on the measurement of time intervals between successive sinus cardiac beats, in practice RR intervals.	0.6040503733638309
Hence, results of HRV calculation depend on the quality of primary data acquisition.	0.5684177332382515
However, technical standards on accuracy of RR interval acquisition in magnetic tape and digital solid state Holter ECG systems do not exist as yet.	0.5210687790337193
Therefore in a laboratory investigation accuracy of HRV parameter calculation after traditional standard tape with and without real-time analysis and digital solid state data acquisition was compared in three commercial Holter ECG systems [Ela medical (E), Oxford Medilog Excel (O) and Medset Cardiolight (M)].	0.5108030636072999
A computer-based ECG simulator was used to synthesize a test signal consisting of artificial P-QRS complexes of fixed rate, quartz stabilized "sinus rhythms".	0.43391113481735233
Two channel analog tape and digital 24h recordings of the fixed rate test signal were performed simultaneously.	0.3388353900499273
The influence of recording technology on accuracy of RR interval measurement and consequently on time domaine HRV was shown by comparing five standard 24-h time domain parameters.	0.43223911906556245
As expected, in the three Holter systems the analog tape recordings showed a higher, technically induced, artificial RR variability.	0.5956337353312674
The SDNN values (E: 9.38ms vs 2.68ms; p<0.001; O: 3.89ms vs 0.97ms; p<0.001; M: 10.47ms vs 2.89ms; p=0.001), SDNN-Index values (E: 8.22ms vs 0.90ms; p<0.001; O: 3.75ms vs 0.90ms; p<0.001; M: 7.81ms vs 1.49ms, p<0.001) and RMSSD-values (E: 10.39ms vs 2.16ms; p<0.001; O: 10.05ms vs 1.88ms, p<0.001; M: 8.62ms vs 1.69ms; p<0.001) were significantly lower if acquisition was done by digital solid devices in all systems, SDANN (M: 9.83ms vs 5.37ms; p<0.001) in the Medset system too.	0.6121087089978794
The used method is a possible way to validate commercial Holter ECG systems for HRV analysis.	0.5476167044981443
Clinical significance of artifical HRV seems to be low.	0.5184293653884131
Cases of gallstone ileus (108) were analyzed retrospectively over 30 years.	0.6800717355861183

Aerobilia was seen in 17 % of the patients.	0.6752975225938532
Since 1992 sonography has proveded an exact diagnosis in 10 of 15 cases.	0.5062452101642227
In the triad of known gallstone, non-specific epigastric pain with assumed small intestinal obstruction, and impossible detection of a stone in the gallbladder, there is strong suspicion of a gallstone ileus.	0.5936859457652948
The evidence is given if the gallstone is seen in the bowels.	0.5084083775029106
Intraoperatively more than one stone was found in the intestines in 20 %, and cholecystoduodenal fistulas were encountered in 83 %.	0.7059799528282532
There has been no significant change in mortality for 30 years.	0.5694988280810711
Autologous transplantation in brachial plexus injuries has become significantly more efficacious through increased knowledge of the microtopographic anatomy of the fascicle structures and the refinement of microneurosurgical techniques.	0.41752712819670856
Recovery of shoulder and upper arm functions can be achieved with autologous transplantation in the majority of patients under optimized conditions.	0.6535494133896749
However, attempts to restore forearm, hand and finger functions in this way have been disappointing so far.	0.5750980403270227
Therapeutic success is primarily governed by early decision making, selection of adequate surgical strategies and intensive and longlasting postoperative management.	0.4291508358602771
Leg venectasia is a common problem.	0.5306406117867225
Although there are a variety of therapeutic modalities, none of them gives satisfactory results.	0.583508237462142
The effects of sclerotherapy in the treatment of telangiectasia with a small diameter are poor.	0.45925570564034374
Electrocoagulation and argon laser treatment often result in scarring.	0.29303788005615894
We studied the effectiveness of the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser at a wavelength of 585 nm in the treatment of leg venectasia.	0.45334687756934017
After repeated treatments using this laser system, only 30% of the vessels that looked blue on clinical examination could be removed; we obtained better lightening of smaller red, telangiectatic vessels with a diameter up to 0.4 mm.	0.6755104732438503
However, hyperpigmentation frequently developed after treatment.	0.3394226159799566
In post-treatment biopsies, occlusion of the vessels was found.	0.6074787650594285
Based on these results, we recommend a combined therapy for leg venectasia.	0.8899507709153702
Larger diameter vessels should be treated with sclerotherapy, while finer telangiectasia can be treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser.	0.6549807632209924
Total hip replacement is often recommended for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	0.5882743591162689
A less invasive approach with shorter operating time is the replacement of the femoral head only, leaving the acetabular cartilage in situ.	0.5863349000657712
Hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using a metallic head prosthesis was not successful in the past, because the majority of patients developed protrusio acetabuli after surgery.	0.6361127816242248
In the present study hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an Al2O3-ceramic head was shown to be a useful method for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	0.6606856537017228
From 1985 to 1990 277 patients were treated with hemiarthroplasty.	0.5204135595818647

A standardized score was calculated assessing activity, gait, hip pain, etc., with the patients obtaining an average score of 58 out of a possible 78 points.	0.6892370941899151
Only three patients had hip pain, and in four cases the roentgenographic examination revealed protrusio acetabuli.	0.7827482476466805
Two of these four patients underwent revision surgery for replacement of the cup, leaving the stem in situ.	0.5179724202734446
In view of the small number of approach-related complications, hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an Al2O3-ceramic head is the recommended surgical treatment for femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.	0.5177342902696705
In the rare patient with protrusio acetabuli, revision surgery can be performed to replace the cup, leaving the stem in situ.	0.5572142555565033
Functional relaxation (FE), a somato-psychotherapeutic method, can reduce asthmatic symptoms.	0.565850312071785
The efficiency of a 5 minute introduction of elements of functional relaxation (EFE) is compared with a placebo-relaxation-method not based on the hypothetical mechanisms of FE, and a standardised pharmacological bronchodilative test using salbutamol.	0.6890610342173636
In a controlled prospective randomised single blind setting 18 children and adolescents with acute asthma were treated on three consecutive days with each method.	0.4731494977589149
Before and ten minutes after therapy the patients had bodyplethysmographic pulmonary function testing.	0.5522736973316248
U-Tests showed that the baseline measurements were comparable.	0.5110238952815851
The before-after-comparison revealed significant changes for EFE and salbutamol, not for the placebo-relaxation.	0.49662694745154495
There were significant differences between the intraindividual differences of the airway resistance and the specific airway resistance between salbutamol and the placebo-relaxation, not between EFE and salbutamol or EFE and the placebo-relaxation.	0.5977047031494569
FE can be an effective complementary treatment in children or adolescents with asthma.	0.5585800008890243

Concomitant pathologies (labral lesions, intra-/extra-osseous ganglia and stress bone marrow edema) in adult residual hip dysplasia (RHD) might influence the outcome of conservative hip surgery.	0.6362761436808596
The aim of our prospective clinical study was to assess the value of preoperative MR arthrography in diagnosing concomitant lesions and in making surgical decisions in RHD.	0.6593157486229124
The first 37 consecutive patients with a minimum follow-up of 18 months have been analysed.	0.8120115430678359
All 37 patients presented RHD with the clinical symptomatology of labral lesions and underwent routine preoperative MRA.	0.4873523824200931
According to clinical, radiological and MR arthrographical criteria, these 37 patients were subdivided into four therapeutic subgroups: (1) reorientation of the acetabulum using the Tönnis triple pelvic osteotomy (TPO); (2) intertrochanteric varisation osteotomy (IVO); (3) palliative decompression with only symptomatic partial resection of the torn labrum (PALL); (4) primary total hip replacement (TEP).	0.5745558351737059
Based on the preliminary clinical and radiological outcomes of these four subgroups, the following conclusions can be drawn: labral lesions are considered to be a sign of chronic joint instability.	0.7438076375399832
Therefore, acetabular malorientation should be corrected by redirectional osteotomy of the acetabulum (TPO-subgroup) even in low grades of RHD if labral lesions are present.	0.5530970801321209
"Palliative" labral resections without corrective osteotomy (PALL subgroup) in secondary osteoarthritis due to RHD are definitively obsolete, because they rapidly progress to severe osteoarthritis due to surgically accelerated joint instability.	0.5236753529189143
In RHD with highly osteoarthritic hip joints and concomitant lesions, one should not hesitate to perform primary THR even in young patients.	0.5263845489380355
Severe infections of the talus are often associated with complete septic collapse of the talus.	0.5965434994673213
In this connection, open fractures with defects or significant comminution have a bad prognosis is as far as reconstruction of the talus is concerned.	0.6461038561513983
In the Department of Traumatology, Braunschweig, in 1995 three patients (all male, average age 35.3 +/- 10.2 years) were treated with cancellous bone grafting after talectomy performed because of infection and complete septic collapse of the talus.	0.7464553169586055
In two of these cases third-degree open total dislocation of the talus had been sustained.	0.8144275990401953
The third patient came to us after undergoing arthroscopy of the ankle region in another hospital.	0.5728576098811863
In each case a fulminating infection was the outcome.	0.43250723146425496
Following a step-by-step algorithm, in a first step urgent radical debridement with talectomy was done.	0.6447185328025165
To maintain approximation between the tibia and calcaneus on one side and the os naviculare on the other, the bony defect was filled with PMMA chains and the external fixateur technique was used for immobilization during treatment of the infection.	0.7051155297659468
After second- and third-look procedures a free flap was grown for soft tissue coverage within the first 10 days.	0.6053524230648984
After 17.6 +/- 3.3 days the talus was replaced with a cancellous bone graft, combined with double arthrodesis in two cases, and external fixation for the next 4-5 weeks.	0.7441198126170284
In the third patient a triple arthrodesis was done.	0.475702147291517
At follow-up after an average of 12 months (range 8-17 months), the bone graft with arthrodesis had been completely integrated in all cases.	0.8153632852220243
All patients are free of symptoms in normal life.	0.6779348365174497
In the case of severe open fractures of the talus with significant comminution combined with infection and septic bone collapse conservation of the talus is often impossible.	0.6555054568838864
The combination of homologous cancellous bone grafting and arthrodesis after talectomy is therefore a good method of keeping any decrease in the function of the foot to a minimum.	0.5877658826198682

Immunosuppression-related Candida infections may be most successfully treated using biological response modifiers and recombinant cytokines to enhance expression of host pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators, notably tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN).	0.5361826646943494
Important but unappreciated differences in the immunopathophysiology of fungal vs. bacterial infections make such cytokine priming appear contrary to current strategies for reducing cytokine-mediated organ injury and mortality due to gram-negative bacteremia and endotoxemia.	0.409216700626843
Optimistically, preclinical studies to date have found that the coadministration of such immunoadjuvants does not compromise, and actually may improve, the efficacy of synthetic antifungals.	0.5790938797135509
Such combination therapies should continue to be evaluated in animal models of Candida infection which otherwise progress to lethal shock or chronic disseminated disease despite aggressive use of existing antifungal agents.	0.4520308201965502

Complications such as preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor may lead to premature delivery.	0.4157148286375212
The main goal of prenatal treatment of polyhydramnios is thus the improvement of fetal outcome through prolongation of gestation and/or the alleviation of maternal symptoms.	0.5593304314627278
With the recent developments in computer technology and the improvements in modern neuroimaging, frame-based stereotactic guidance for open microsurgical procedures has been increasingly replaced by neuronavigation, also called frameless stereotaxy.	0.4716507929938074
It allows transfer of individual patient's images onto the operative field to assist the neurosurgeon intraoperatively in defining the tumor margins or identifying functionally important brain areas.	0.45782718046422727
The different localization techniques employed are articulated position-sensing arms, infrared or ultrasound systems working with the principle of satellite navigation and robotic systems integrated with the operating microscope.	0.42857091145878007
In 200 operations performed with different systems (arm-based, robotic and infrared) the method proved to be helpful, enabling fewer invasive procedures to be performed.	0.6676388647316033
With a mean deviation of 2.87 +/- 1.9 mm for intraoperative localization, the accuracy was only slightly worse than in frame-based stereotaxy with deviations below 2 mm.	0.7635158934167132
Neuronavigation was most helpful for operations on deeply seated lesions, skull-base tumors and lesions in brain areas with high functionality.	0.44631475008103444
The major disadvantage is the use of preoperative data for navigation, leading to inaccuracies when anatomical structures are altered during the operation by resection of tumors or shift of intracranial soft tissue.	0.5226402144409862
Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be a solution for this problem.	0.4189530432469532
With the method of intraoperative MRI developed in our department it has already been possible to update neuronavigation with images reflecting intraoperative changes in anatomy.	0.5653147512651032
Therefore, neuronavigation is definitely a method with growing importance in operative routine, and it will also spread into other surgical specialties.	0.5697829392184378
Severe pain of mucositis induced by cytostatic conditioning therapy in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients generally requires continuous parenteral opioid treatment.	0.5392712051559966
Cognitive and psychological disturbances are frequent complications subsequent to BMT and may result from cerebral opioid side effects.	0.5203449587043366
The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of continuous morphine in mucositis pain and the side-effects in BMT patients.	0.6747684393828202
Particular emphasis was placed on the question of whether reaction times, which are usually measured to estimate opioid effects upon vigilance, are influenced by pain-induced cognitive impairments in pain patients.	0.6878155731248805
Methods While in hospital, 10 BMT patients were examined daily with the aid of a mucositis scale, subjective visual analog scales (VAS) for pain and mood parameters, a German version of the McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ), and a mental performance task battery, and the morphine given was documented.	0.7365455516327808
Mental performance tests were simple auditory reaction time and choice reaction time.	0.38580685332603626
Seven patients also performed a Sternberg memory search test in which they had to use 'yes' and 'no' response keys to match visually presented test letters to a previously memorized set of letters.	0.4282897915800606
Practice and baseline data were collected within the first week before BMT.	0.7000555967385178
Results The intensity and duration of mucositis differed from patient to patient, resulting in different pain intensities and MPQ scores.	0.42359153889630485
Prolongation of the choice reaction time averaged over the period of mucositis treatment correlated significantly with residual pain intensity (Spearman rs = 0.88, p < 0.01) but not with morphine dose (rs = 0.35, p = 0.33).	0.5640799979779079
For the Sternberg memory search test greater correlation coefficients resulted between reaction time and morphine dose (rs = 0.86, p = 0.014) than between reaction time and residual pain intensity (rs = 0.61, p = 0.15).	0.49585798151129207
In turn, pain intensity, unlike morphine dose, was significantly correlated with high scores in the mood parameters for depression, passivity, and tiredness.	0.6973993887591189
Conclusions It is concluded that both pain and morphine can impair cognitive performance, but that these mental stressors seem to differ according to qualitative criteria.	0.5103815020149208
Whereas pain might slow reaction time by distracting a patient's attention, particularly in low mental demand tasks, morphine could interfere with more specific cognitive processes, such as short-term memory operations, that are required in more complex tasks.	0.6695549035255757
The case of a 63-year-old man with a widespread retroperitoneal tumor and two tumor nodules in the left testis is described.	0.664438223642798

Autopsy revealed another tumor nodule in the right atrium.	0.5376301130096935
Macroscopically, the bone marrow appeared normal.	0.7645559687575013
The tumor cells were reactive for CD45, vimentin and chloroacetate esterase, but were unreactive with a broad spectrum of antibodies against myelomonocytic and lymphocytic antigens and antibodies against tryptase and c-kit (CD117), characteristic markers for mast cells.	0.564366611280484
However, the bone marrow exhibited the typical picture of mastocytosis.	0.7723612820083788
A diagnosis of bone marrow mastocytosis with an associated secondary extramedullary mast cell sarcoma was established.	0.48755983332593045
The cause of death was heart failure due to arrhythmia caused by an exophytic atrioseptal tumor nodule.	0.5522228557580114

CT shows hemorrhage and calcification well.	0.21348617603194414
The criteria are the primary site, size, tumor growth, brain-stem enlargement, delineation, intralesional structure, exophytic components and enhancement.	0.5939546928798304
Secondary criteria are herniation, hydrocephalus and liquorgenic seeding.	0.3205822326949486
In CT glioma are hypodense, in MRI hyperintense in T2 and hypointense in T1.	0.41953160959848995
Enhancement is seen in 25-60% and does not allow differentiation of tumor vs nontumor or gradings.	0.5991300657016099
Factors influencing poor outcome are high grade, a short history, cranial nerve involvement, severe brain-stem enlargement, pontine site, diffuse growth and recurrency.	0.6247647106495471
The 5-year-survival rate is 30% (after radiation: focal tumors 85%, diffuse 20%).	0.7891524342400548

Patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days (median total dose 60 GyE).	0.4744248985090238
Other histologies were treated with carbon ion boost of 15 to 18 GyE delivered to the macroscopeic tumor after fractionated stereotatic radiotherapy (median total dose 63 GyE).	0.4738344292091575
Mean follow-up was 9 months.	0.6700633473038357
Irradiation was well tolerated by all patients.	0.4897129581637861
Partial tumor remission was seen in 7 patients (15,5%) (Figure 2).	0.7486324979920913
One-year local control rate was 94%.	0.49493955695687186

No severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed.	0.45810876987856813
Clinical effectiveness and technical feasibility of this modality could clearly be demonstrated in our study.	0.6398286071649347
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the different beam modalities studies with larger patient numbers are necessary.	0.6615281929820145
To continue our project a new heavy ion acclerator exclusively for clinical use is planed to be constructed in Heidelberg.	0.4126202524256745
Indirect trauma to the shoulder and knee joint often results in injuries to the ligaments and the capsule, and more rarely in fractures.	0.5735779028584906
Anterior shoulder dislocation is common.	0.33621463608639496

Objective: Comparison of low back pain (LBP) patients with and without fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) with regard to affective distress.	0.6066853117225673
Methods: Patients with LBP who had been admitted to various clinics in Germany were examined upon admission.	0.6040203161062976
Comparisons were done by dividing the patients into groups with and without signs of FMS.	0.43566278272181386
Additionally, both groups were compared after being matched according to sex, age, and pain severity.	0.765770109842763
Results: 15 out of 135 LBP patients met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia.	0.4193787811259368
Patients with FMS showed remarkably higher levels of pain severity and affective distress.	0.40822977749719275
After controlling for different levels of pain severity, these pronounced differences disappeared.	0.5599368515100089
Conclusion: Affective distress is not a unique feature of FMS, but seem to be caused entirely by higher levels of pain severity.	0.6855910900035599
Methods: Cases of invasive HI-infections were reported in a national active surveillance program.	0.5604069700086012
The case definition required the typical clinical picture and a HI positive culture from a physiologically sterile site (or throat swab or tracheal aspirate in case of epiglottitis or pneumonia) in children up to 10 years.	0.6541488666814146
All initial reports were validated with a questionnaire that additionally questioned the vaccination status, type of vaccine, therapy, outcome of the disease and characteristics of the bacteria.	0.7637348627080519
The relation between the type of Hib vaccine used on the risk of infection was analysed in a case control study with controls selected at random from a population based sampling frame.	0.6275193638652585
Results: 310 confirmed cases of invasive HI infections were reported during the observation period, 199 of these with meningitis, 56 with epiglottitis.	0.5058171879504104
The number of cases declined from 71 in the last six months of 1992, 120 in 1993, and 65 in 1994 to 54 cases in 1995.	0.6476796561845541
In 1995 the incidence in up to 5 year old children was 1.1/100 000 for all infection sites and 0.7/100 000 for meningitis.	0.7207241988216854
The reduced rates were mainly due to a decrease in the number of unvaccinated cases, whereas the number of cases in vaccinated children fluctuated between 22 and 36 per year.	0.6014285729441111
Most of these were observed in incompletely vaccinated children, who according to the German recommendations could already have received at least one further vaccination at the time of the infection.	0.852263641405277
The type of vaccine (HbOC, PRP-D or OMP) was not significantly associated with the risk of infection in vaccinated children.	0.7497025158182634
10 % of the bacteria produced betalactamase.	0.6991153514753282
In accordance with the German recommendations third generation cephalosporines were used in almost all cases of meningitis.	0.7318386204884192
One third of these, however, received additional antibiotics.	0.4599385127523397
Conclusions: The present incidence of systemic HI infections in Germany is low.	0.7434650320174063
A further decrease, however, would be possible with "on time" completion of the vaccination schedule according to the German recommendations in all children.	0.6524835619962793
For more than a century peritoneal adhesions are being recognized as frequent sequelae following abdominal surgery.	0.48580825309106324
Intraoperative lesions of the mesothelial lining by abrasion, ischemia, dissication, and foreign bodies result in complaints, intestinal obstruction, female infertility, and problems during reoperations.	0.5530149746752215
The global increase of life expectancy and surgical procedures are leading to rising incidences of adhesion-related complications and subsequent socio-economic implications.	0.5972490582009079
As of today, there is no safe and efficient prophylaxis available.	0.5806101188670644
Scientific efforts should be aimed at a liquid substance for single intraperitoneal application which significantly reduces postoperative adhesions at reasonable cost without adverse effects on blood coagulation and wound healing.	0.3852171871432067
Even today the name of F. D. von Recklinghausen is often mentioned in connection with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism.	0.4524985639451726
He was one of the first physicians and scientists to render outstanding services to the classification of structural changes of bones, and in many aspects his work remains valid today.	0.7377606332820471
He succeeded through precise and comparative studies in making the disease and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism known and thus distinguishing it from other known structural bone diseases.	0.5469446661607084
He also described the phenomenon of "bone remodeling" which has become relevant today again.	0.6519066250787822
Although his written macroscopic and microscopic observations include meticulously precise differentiations which make it difficult to study them today, they are still of interest in order to follow his basic ideas.	0.47080369302443376
This article does not constitute a comprehensive biography, but it contains a description of F. D. von Recklinghausen's important work on bone pathology against the background of the main stages of his life.	0.5860595409843001
Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) of the extremities are characterized by a high rate of local recurrences.	0.7360423742078712
Limb salvage approaches using multimodality therapy protocols have replaced amputation.	0.2753341122053246
In order to evaluate isolated hyperthermic limb perfusion (ILP) in a multimodality therapy concept, we reviewed our patients treated using this method.	0.771935659233187
Between January 1982 and December 1995, 25 ILPs, using cisplatin, melphalan and adriamycin, were performed in 22 patients with STS.	0.7077827296685251
Forty percent were treated for local recurrences; histology was dominated by malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and synovial sarcoma.	0.5023031305437669
In all, 68 % of the STS were classified as UICC stage IIb or IIIa/b.	0.5319824166477275
Most of the cases (14) underwent wide or radical resection, 4 patients received intraoperative radiotherapy, and 5 were treated with external beam radiation.	0.9387478198473264
Complications were recorded in 32 % of the cases.	0.6999965832354754
With a median follow-up of 45 months (range 1-143), the 5-year overall survival rate was 81 %.	0.8002033584398284
The median recurrence-free time was 19 months and the 5-year disease-free survival rate 34 %.	0.6638317526581501
There were 13 local failures, and distant metastases developed in 36 % of the patients.	0.7121581036318412
Concerning high-grade sarcomas (UICC stage IIb, IIIa/b), we found local recurrences in 75 % of all cases.	0.8634598740055336
Five of 11 patients with local failures underwent perfusion after they refused amputation, and 7 incompletely resected STS received ILP without reoperation.	0.5192941077712802
All of these demonstrated local recurrence.	0.4085254257108827
This rate of local recurrence proved to be different from patients with tumor-free resection margins (p = 0.0001, log-rank test).	0.6300319907617684
The amputation rate after isolated limb perfusion was 27 % (mean 11 months after treatment).	0.7068626386545911
Long-term results of ILP showed a considerable local recurrence rate and a low disease-free survival.	0.7436316511029506
Perfusion in patients without tumor-free resection margins does not prevent local recurrence.	0.6296372255750152
We conclude that ILP with cisplatin, melphalan and adriamycin should be considered carefully and is not an additional treatment strategy of first choice.	0.6616364990350561
Infections with the grampositive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs mostly in worst ill, multimorbide patients treated with cytostatica or antibiotics.	0.35333456167929084
We report about two healthy children with pseudomembranous colitis caused by Clostridium difficile without an underlying illness or a former history of antibiotic treatment.	0.4390290337906098
Huntington's disease (HD) may cause considerable diagnostic problems because of the highly variable clinical features, especially at the beginning of the illness.	0.7423725120070744
We report the case of a 21-year-old woman with definite HD whose main symptoms were psychopathological changes that were misinterpreted as schizophrenia for 7 years.	0.4681446886679442
One reason for this misdiagnosis was the unusual, very early onset and the remarkable earlier age of onset of HD compared with that of other affected relatives.	0.5322268559559639
The phenomenon of earlier onset within one affected family is well documented in the literature in cases with the paternally transmitted mutated gene.	0.6513565784799114
Diagnostic landmarks were consideration of the initially mild disturbances of movement and the once again repeated detailed examination of the family history.	0.6045533131264416
ICD-10 is to be implemented for morbidity coding in Germany soon.	0.5242074876613076
The electronic versions of ICD-10 are introduced.	0.2628199740237002
For everyday work with the classification and for epidemiological research further tools are provided by DIMDI: ICD-10 meta files, ICD conversion tables, ICD-10 thesaurus of diagnostic terms.	0.28516576222563456
All files are available free of charge via the INTERNET.	0.2320699357298376
Because of poorly compartmentalized paraclavicular soft tissues, total extraperiostal claviculectomy in cases of malignoma with cortical destruction is always marginal.	0.3908082683263792
Due to different muscular compensation in the patients examined, literature disagrees on the biomechanical consequences of claviculectomy for the shoulder girdle.	0.5114034297261248
Thrombolytic therapy of pulmonary embolism with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has proved to be an established method; but intra- and postoperatively, there is a high risk of bleeding complications.	0.9370184434422365
A 50-year old female with familiar hypophosphatasia and suspected deep venous thrombosis was undergoing osteosynthesis of a femoral fracture.	0.5214737227648967
Intraoperatively, petCO2 suddenly dropped, paCO2 rose, and circulatory arrest occurred.	0.42990170576405
CPR was started immediately with closed-chest cardiac compression and intravenous application of catecholamines.	0.447575327204771
While continuing CPR, surgery was stopped, the wound was sealed provisionally, and the patient was transferred to the ICU.	0.8090023802484084
Because of suspected massive pulmonary embolism, thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in a total dosage of 100 mg was begun.	0.548048075695542
2.25 hours after the onset of circultory arrest, and 1.5 hours after the beginning of thrombolysis, the patient's hemodynamic patterns under high-dosage catecholamines were satisfactory.	0.7858298282673343
The bleeding after thrombolysis and coagulopathy required massive blood transfusions.	0.2655085977701035
The situation was also complicated by lesions of the liver, spleen and small intestines, which required surgical intervention, and acute renal failure, which had to be treated with transient hemofiltration.	0.8410708574454233
Twenty-eight days after receiving CPR, the patient was discharged from the ICU.	0.8288870321784678
A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was established by clinical signs, capnometry, blood gas analysis, and electrocardiography.	0.7786366064168814
Due to the requirements of the emergency situation (ongoing CPR), further diagnostic tools were not used.	0.760989782165928
The patient survived without any neurological deficiency, despite the extended 135-min use of CPR, and despite massive bleeding due to surgical trauma, and to performing CPR in the presence of fibrinolytica.	0.6480194320740484
With the increasing use of cross-sectional echocardiography in patients with overt or suspected pulmonary thromboembolism in the emergency rooms, more and more right atrial thrombi are detected.	0.6345933208062831
These are so-called "transitthrombi" from the venous system on their way to the pulmonary arteries and they are a severe presentation of thromboembolic disease.	0.6378017561315225
They appear as an imminent pulmonary embolism and usually coexists with an already massive embolism.	0.44759726686426343
In patients were a right atrial thrombus is associated with a patent foramen ovale, paradoxical arterial embolism has been observed.	0.5404519314162917
Right sided heart thrombi have a high mortality rate and need immediate treatment.	0.5769779083706252
In our hospital we have seen 14 patients with right atrial thrombi and pulmonary embolism in a period of 6 years.	0.753072347591728
Three patients had cardiac arrest with a massive pulmonary embolism, seven patients presented with a submassive embolism.	0.6896757305089647
All patients were treated immediately after echocardiographic diagnosis without pulmonary angiography.	0.6890205408000964
In about half of the cases transesophageal echocardiography was done additionally for diagnosis and monitoring.	0.7099826834192544
Therapeutic options were thrombectomy, fibrinolysis or anticoagulants.	0.3491063089853103
We treated one of our patients with thrombectomy, eleven patients with fibrinolysis and two patients with anticoagulants.	0.6710784630139168
The era of modern anaesthesia in Germany began on January 24th, 1847.	0.43029306879885126
This day, professor in ordinary Johann Ferdinand Heyfelder anaesthetized a patient with sulphuric ether in the clinic of surgery and ophthalmology of the University of Erlangen.	0.5520434352245381
By March 17th, 1847, Heyfelder had performed 121 surgical procedures under ether.	0.3437292032207569
The operations in majority were teeth-extractions, and a few more complex operations such as the treatment of a harelip or of lip cancer or the resection of the shoulder joint.	0.7315548294708215
Heyfelder described in detail 108 of these inhalations in a little book entitled The experiments with sulphuric ether.	0.3989883788505801
This monograph published in March, 1847, represents one of the first complete dissertations on sulphuric ether in the German literature.	0.5863705443776951
In a special chapter he analyzed the development of various physiological and psychological parameters during etherization.	0.4457819922162358
Heyfelder also examined blood and urine of some etherized patients and reported that he did not find any important or specific alterations.	0.40593053553439
In 1847, Heyfelder was probably the first to apply salt-ether in man.	0.5073269197595558
After 4 administrations he concluded that salt ether acted more quickly but shorter than sulphuric ether.	0.28487285931528844
Advantageous were its application without problems and ease of induction.	0.34159105894449976
Disadvantageous were its high volatility, its price and the difficulty of getting it in a pure form.	0.46498088634546136
From December, 1847, on Heyfelder started to use chloroform.	0.5068446653945007
He was now able to perform more major operations, for example the total resection of the hip-joint.	0.7227702732992308
In his book The experiments with sulphuric ether, salt ether, and chloroform he describes a great number of anaesthetic administrations using these 3 agents.	0.441891309630245
In his summary Heyfelder concluded, that chloroform was undoubtly superior to sulphuric ether mainly because it was a quicker acting and longer lasting agent and leads to deeper narcosis.	0.4512551690351906
Moreover its application was much easier for it needed no special apparatus.	0.30900404796556885
However, because of its great anaesthetic potency, Heyfelder particularly demanded great caution in the application of chloroform.	0.6497804616482401
Explicitely he expected an assistant for chloroformizations, whose only duty was to supervise the inhalations and the patient - a forerunner of the modern specialized anaesthesiologist.	0.608943896062858
Background: To evaluate the publication rate of abstracts presented during the German Anaesthesia Congress (DAK) in MEDLINE-listed journals in comparison to the publication rate of abstracts presented during the meeting of the European Society of Anaesthesiologists (ESA).	0.5268970344778005
The uniform development of the human embryo, as described by classic human embryology, has been confirmed by sonoembryological studies.	0.7472045215090503
In particular, the embryonic brain is suitable for transvaginal ultrasound examination, because the large "cystic" cavities of the brain can easily be imaged.	0.6533370243788109
Sonoembryology not only describes normal embryonic anatomy and normal relations and proportions of organs, but also the development of structural abnormalities.	0.6141362872173113
Approximately one-third of all congenital anomalies, originate from the central nervous system (CNS).	0.35879945580225825
Based on normal sonoembryology and on recent experiences with early CNS anomalies, we recognize some sonographic signs of an early CNS anomaly: (1) Apparent dysmorphology of the brain or the head; (2) Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain compartments, where the amount of fluid is either greater or less than normal; (3) In the early fetal period, choroid plexuses that are too small to fill the ventricle from the medial to the lateral wall; (4) Irregular contour of the spine/back; (5) Extra-CNS anomalies.	0.6726990306110875
In the following survey, normal sonoembryology of the CNS is described, and CNS anomalies of the early pregnancy are discussed.	0.734104511903605
Telomerase is an enzyme that elongates telomeric repeats, the specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that provide genomic stability and compensate for the physiologic process of telomere shortening.	0.4349347239643882
It has been implicated in cellular senescence, immortalization, and carcinogenesis.	0.5859161307188405
Over 85% of human tumours, and 95% of non-melanocytic skin cancers, show telomerase activity, in contrast to the corresponding normal tissues.	0.8296652861194281
This suggests that telomerase activity may play an important role in carcinogenesis.	0.40704664768548027
Recent evidence shows that telomerase is active not only in embryonal and germ line tissues, but also in some normal tissues.	0.6479103354832144
In the skin, this activity has been traced to the stem-cell-bearing epidermal basal cell layer, possibly reflecting the presence of telomerase-competent stem cells.	0.5859173341066914
These findings require a reconsideration of our interpretation of telomerase activity in tumours of the skin and other tissues.	0.586652572441831
As a causal relationship linking telomerase activity and cancer has yet not been demonstrated, some caution is warranted.	0.4898178333872053
The established criteria of auditory brainstem responses (ABR) such as JV latency, JI-V interpeak latency and interaural differences of  latency or amplitude have been found to be sensitive for detecting tumors of the cerebellopontine angle if a response is present.	0.4692003032338176
However, the ABR can be absent in cases of acoustic neuromas because of desynchronization, even though pure-one audiometry indicates that responses should be present.	0.5881264103903115
This retrospective study compared the ABR and pure-tone thresholds in 234 cases with cerebellopontine angle tumors and a control group of 181 cases with sensory hearing losses in order to quantify threshold discrepancies.	0.5590966355360197
The average deficit of the objective ABR threshold (DOABRT) to the subjective pure-tone threshold for those frequencies between 1-6 kHz was 3.6 dB for the control group (ABR and pure tone thresholds very close) and 31.2 dB for the tumor group (ABR threshold much higher than the pure-tone threshold).	0.7714439829539761
ABR thresholds 30 dB higher than the high-frequency pure tone thresholds were found in 40.6% of the tumor group and in none of the control group.	0.8529264289756754
Thus, deficits of the ABR threshold >30 dB can be considered to be an additional criterion for detecting retrocochlear disease and increases ABR sensitivity for tumor detection even if responses are absent.	0.6605325478649615
The association of nevus flammeus with mongolian spot, nevus fuscoceruleus, nevus spilus and, with variable frequency, with nevus anemicus has been termed phacomatosis pigmentovascularis, a genodermatosis first described by Ota and co-workers.	0.6038780891461145
Four different combinations have been specified.	0.31539895356894476
Most cases are reported from the Japanese literature.	0.6030674909408233
Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis may constitute an exclusively cutaneous disorder, but overlapping with other syndromes like Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome or Sturge-Weber syndrome is also possible.	0.45153089546599523
We report a 30-year-old woman with nevus flammeus on the back and right arm associated with nevus fuscoceruleus on the back.	0.6608084754195401
ORIF management of unstable trochanteric fractures of type A3 of the A0 classification is difficult because of lateral dislocation of the proximal fractured segments, particularly when only the sliding hip-screw is used for fixation.	0.6492876399489447
A connectable butt-press plate was recently developed in order to prevent this type of dislocation.	0.44792601438650664
We review the results with this fixation technique in 22 elderly patients with an average age of 76 years who presented with highly unstable trochanteric fracture of the A3 type.	0.6653408408715333
Three patients died of diseases unrelated to the trauma or operation before the fractures had healed.	0.5450012224920966
The other 19 were followed prospectively until fracture healing had occurred.	0.344901376109584
Complaints, leg shortening and changes in the CCD angle were recorded.	0.5398672734445611
Furthermore, the mobility score was determined.	0.5826518515547936
Although the patients were able to bear full weight after the operation, no lateral dislocation of fragments was observed.	0.6168536694577514
Only 1 patient had a varus dislocation of 5  ° until the fracture had consolidated.	0.6428341254688376
This was due to severe osteopenia and subsequent dislocation of the screw within the femoral head.	0.5532671473800357
No pseudarthrosis, osteitis or rotational malalignment was noted.	0.33711953832320335
Five of the surviving patients had a lower mobility score after fracture healing as compared to the status before the fracture was sustained.	0.6316204703196783
On the basis of this review, we recommend the use of this new connectable buttress plate with sliding hip screws because it provides sifficient fixation of highly unstable fractures of type A3.	0.7490745836711004
Superficial leptomeningeal hemosiderosis is a rare disease of the central nervous system.	0.6779882809345698
Chronic bleeding into the subarachnoid space causes deposition of hemosiderin in glial cells and subsequent damage to adjacent brain tissue.	0.3238974574298383
There is a characteristic predilection for the cerebellum and eighth cranial nerve.	0.5293306461303069
Accordingly, among a variety of symptoms, cerebellar ataxia and sensorineural hearing loss progressing to total deafness commonly occur.	0.4685470493786968
To date, the hearing loss has been believed to be purely neural.	0.5214270134909476
We present a case of superficial hemosiderosis in a patient with total deafness who was successfully provided with a cochlear implant.	0.6528182095000439
Audiometry demonstrated total bilateral cochlear hearing losses but with preserved function of the eighth cranial nerve.	0.3532448276122135
These findings make us conclude that in contrast to current opinion, superficial hemosiderosis can initially damage the cochlea alone.	0.47465768757854343
Thus, patients with total deafness due to this disorder may benefit from cochlear implantation.	0.6308590266429096
All patients require careful audiometric assessment, including promontory stimulation.	0.5130182349630018
Intracardiac masses remain a challenge for imaging diagnosis.	0.39978089860041943
Although most lesions are initially detected by echocardiography, additional imaging studies, i.e., magnetic resonance imaging and electron beam computed tomography, are commonly requested.	0.5824538177637927
Features and limitations of these two imaging techniques are illustrated and briefly analyzed.	0.6080885666825028
For the first time, the present study assessed the achievable predictive value of early self-experienced neuropsychological deficits for the fater development of schizophrenia.	0.5989546277981527
Ninety-six patients with DSM-III-R diagnoses mainly of the formerly neurotic or personality disordered field, of whom 81 % had shown such basic disorders at the time of the index examination and therefore were classified as persons at high risk of developing schizophrenia, were re-examined for schizophrenia.	0.7162123246773181
After an average follow-up period of about 8 years, more than half of the re-examined sample had developed a schizophrenic disorder according to DSM-III-R.	0.6968968286172671
The outcome of schizophrenia versus no schizophrenia was predicted correctly in 77 % of cases by the presence or absence of self-experienced disturbances of perception, thought, speech or action.	0.6219611803026031
To date, at least 12 types of primary dystonia can be distinguished on a genetic basis.	0.6763276608928971
A 3-bp deletion in the DYT1 gene causes early onset, generalized torsion dystonia (TD), and mutations in the GTP cyclohydrolase I and the tyrosine hydroxylase genes result in dopa-responsive dystonia (DYT5).	0.4672206146962581
A missense change in the D2 dopamine receptor in one large family (DYT11) has recently been implicated in myoclonus-dystonia.	0.48923654962735735
Furthermore, seven other loci for dystonia genes have been mapped to chromosomal regions, including a locus for a mixed dystonia phenotype (DYT6), one form of focal dystonia (DYT7), three types of paroxysmal dystonia (DYT8-10), X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT3), and rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT12).	0.5626804694547461
No positive linkage results have yet been obtained for autosomal recessive TD (DYT2) and several other families of different types of dominantly inherited TD (DYT4).	0.4883099927227068
In addition, hereditary secondary dystonia may occur as part of familial diseases of the basal ganglia, metabolic and storage disorders, and various X-linked and other familial neurodegenerative syndromes affecting the basal ganglia.	0.5995818781208128
It may be anticipated that the traditional clinical and etiological classifications of dystonia will increasingly be replaced by a genetic one and that the identification of more dystonia genes may lead to a better understanding of these largely nondegenerative disorders.	0.5530585476923384
In this study we investigated whether, in conjunction with neuroleptics, a psychoeducational and cognitively oriented treatment for schizophrenic outpatients and their key-persons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness within a 2-year follow-up.	0.7118856136182798
This prospective randomized study covered a total of 191 schizophrenic patients (according to DSM-III-R) and comprised a psychoeducational training and cognitive psychotherapy for patients and counseling for their key persons in various combinations.	0.5633606400946096
Patients were examined before, immediately after and 2 years after the end of the intervention.	0.7710373859200486
Patients in the treatment groups reduced their overall psychopathology and their attention deficit.	0.7140397039630383
For patients receiving all three treatment conditions, there was a relevant preventive effect with regard to the rehospitalization rate appearing during the second year of the follow-up.	0.6204717166334698
We conclude that in the mid-term, a combination of psychoeducational and cognitively oriented therapy for patients and their keypersons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness.	0.7441618255056729
Background: Cigarette smoking is common during pregnancy and can expose the developing fetus to transplacental carcinogens, but relatively little information is available on fetal uptake of such compounds.	0.5048371711550179
It was the aim of the present study to analyze the first urine of newborns of mothers who did or did not smoke for metabolites of the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) as well as nicotine and cotinine.	0.7833429242270897
Recently there has been an increase in the prevalent HIV infected population in Germany because of declines in progression to AIDS and death while the number of newly infected patients remains constant.This increases the potential value of both current and new approaches to disease prevention.	0.5327782399494768
Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), defined as treatment of a person who has been exposed to an HIV infected person by a route through which transmission is possible, is one possible way to decrease the number of new cases.	0.6223324413622069
Economic evaluation can help to answer the question whether PEP should be provided to different exposed populations or whether the resources that would be used for PEP should be used for other HIV prevention or treatment interventions.The value of PEP depends both on the costs and effectiveness of the intervention.	0.607625981246734
In this paper, we use examples from the literature to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of PEP in different population subgroups, including those occupationally exposed, those exposed through unprotected sex, and those exposed through IV drug use.	0.7404237383494681
The cost-effectiveness of PEP is also compared to literature estimates of the cost-effectiveness of other prevention activities.	0.5555767236676729
The aim of this study was to access the importance of the laparoscopic colorectal resection.	0.5482886141665598
Of 131 patients 80 were operated on laparoscopically.	0.3208325970405881
The conversion rate was 14 % (13/93).	0.7034262804170185
A total of 47 patients suffered from cancer.	0.4652203044209474
Curative resection was performed in 41 patients (87 %).	0.705385716875287
For comparison, 48 patients who underwent open resection were used.	0.6645344884168852
The complication rate was lower after laparoscopy and no reoperation was performed.	0.4331484866651004
Patients recovered quicker and their first oral food intake and bowel movement were earlier.	0.3446567101330715
Hospital stay was shorter (15.3 vs. 8.1 days), and pain at rest and in motion was significantly reduced.	0.8427800045370448
Equal numbers of mesenteric lymph nodes were retrieved; adequate margins of resection could be obtained and the length of resected bowel did not differ.	0.5332702730850274
No port metastases were observed.	0.2251990756708501
Reduced morbidity, reduced hospital stay, reduced abdominal pain, quicker reconvalescence, and reduced overall health care costs are strong arguments in favor of laparoscopic colectomy.	0.6504353990587765
In the field of traumatology, compartment syndromes of the lower extremity are often seen after fractures and direct injuries, or after ischaemia.	0.6736269204326815
Other causes include over-exertion and non-traumatic causes such as acute rhabdomyolysis, drug-induced myositis and eosinophilic myositis.	0.5047264164750598
This paper describes the clinical and MR course of a compartment syndrome following an ankle sprain.	0.5961451416824417
Each patient has the right of a dedicated pain therapy according to the state of the art.	0.6642952528303945
However an efficient pain therapy is not possible without knowing the cause of pain.	0.6977147872739331
In most posttraumatic pain situations peripheral nociceptors are activated and normal afferences are conducted via an intact nociceptive system.	0.32547918449184465
In contrast, neuropathic pain pain is caused by lesions of the nervous system itself.	0.48183046332219764
Mechanisms of central sensibilization and involvement of the sympathetic nervous system may lead to chronification of such pain conditions.	0.4488007189532516
The therapeutic regime of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is demonstrated by algorithms of treatment modalities.	0.44774934295917845
Apart from classic non-opioid analgesics, co-analgesics and opioids have an important status in chronic pain management as well.	0.48205457316581607
Prescription of these substances has to follow strictly defined standards of pain therapy.	0.4754470482794189
Blockades with local anaesthetics as mono-therapy of chronic pain are obsolete.	0.5846640538076499
In posttraumatic pain, however, a certain number of adjuvant blockades or infiltrations of triggerpoints may be helpful.	0.5414054555968517
The exeptional place of sympathetic blockades are in diagnosis and therapy of sympathetic maintained pain (SMP).	0.4180811232519848
Effects of 94 different psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions on well-being in the elderly were meta-analyzed.	0.5368185943544693
Psychological well-being was improved and self-rated depression decreased for about half a standard deviation.	0.5507551106724299
The mean effect size for other-rated depression reached d=1.15.	0.3254462219330635
Whereas age of participants did not correlate with change in self-rated well-being or depression, other-rated depression improved less in older samples.	0.5317734245370279
High effect sizes derived from control-enhancing interventions and behavior therapy.	0.322839634061953
Sub-analyses showed that individual setting produced higher improvement than group setting.	0.30766857544032217
Higher "therapeutic" qualifications and interventions in nursing homes were associated with higher effect-sizes too.	0.37476131088375525
Implications for planning inteventions in old age are discussed.	0.4211345009222467
The prognosis of laryngeal carcinoma worsens dramatically with the discovery of primary or secondary lymph node metastases.	0.6515038341585542
Thus consistent prophylaxis and therapy of metastases is indispensable.	0.4734380661340518
The standard therapy of manifest cervical lymph node metastases is surgery, if possible using the approach of conservative neck dissection.	0.7300949170520049

Human recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2), alone or in combination with other cytokines, is currently under investigation for the immunotherapy of metastatic tumours.	0.6302275693497236
Objective responses of 20%-35% have been reported in patients with disseminated melanoma and renal cell carcinoma who received high-dose intravenous IL-2 in combination with interferon- (IFN).	0.8533398567225812
However, treatment with IL-2 is complicated by a syndrome of life-threatening adverse reactions such as disseminated vascular leakage, fluid retention, severe hypotension, and (reversible) multiple organ dysfunction (MODS).	0.7132258335227895
A systemic inflammatory reaction (SIRS)/sepsis sepsis-like haemodynamic pattern has been described in patients after IL-2 bolus application alone.	0.6824101329637174
Our purpose was to study the haemodynamic changes in patients treated with high-dose IL-2 administered as a constant infusion and in combination with IFN.	0.6859059570907339
The histopathologic diagnosis of odontogenic cysts is based mainly on the morphological nature of the epithelial lining of cysts and their origin.	0.5522965744852367
We used the international histologic classification set up by the World Health Organisation in 1992.	0.4367290074279152
The aim of this study was to investigate the differentiation of various types of cyst using an immunohistochemical technique rather than by conventional morphological assessment.	0.5879953658129107
About five per cent of the children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia are asymptomatic during parturition and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.	0.5144966677190093

The retrospective results of carbon prostheses for knee ligament reconstruction in 120 patients, as established by questionnaire, are reported at 10  +/-  2 years follow-up.	0.747658302229128
Eighty patients could also be reviewed clinically.	0.3296565723003606
Some 60 % of the patients showed good subjective function at reduced activity level.	0.7171433971457782
Complications were seen in 72.5 % of the patients with rupture of the carbon prosthesis and in 68 % of those with synovitis.	0.925214534667666
X-ray showed osteoarthritis in up to 59 % of the patients.	0.6876958146784486
Carbon prostheses for collateral ligament reconstruction (85 % medial, 5.8 % lateral) were successful in 75 % of cases.	0.8578759056828903
Activity and time seem to be less responsible for failure of the carbon prostheses than the features of growing in.	0.5774855818359728
Destruction of the knee joint over time is due to reactive synovitis and catabolic enzyme reaction and correlates with joint effusion and pain.	0.5212521005835207
If these problems appear, (arthroscopic) resection of the synovia is indicated to interrupt the circulus vitiosus.	0.514671421733905
Background: With resprect to very early screening it has become necessary to apply laboratory techniques more sensitive and more precise than the formerly used Guthrie-test to guarantee correct detection of hyperphenylalaninemias.	0.5034819289446877
Three quantitative methods were compared.	0.19130016628104332
The Viennese Medical School played an important role in the development of radiological examinations and signs of the temporal bone with conventional X-rays.	0.6074627888835477
Famous pioneers include E. G. Mayer (1893-1969) and L. Psenner (1910-1986).	0.47013658625016386
Nowadays conventional X-rays and tomography have lost their important role in diagnostic radiology of the temporal bone, but the basic principles established in those early years of radiology are still used now.	0.6850367087845426
This statement is correct not only for conventional X-rays, but particularly for "poly"-tomography in comparison with CT.	0.7217320163301871
The success of interventional catheter based therapy of coronary artery disease is still limited by a high rate of chronic restenosis.	0.6779608631508802
Using alternative mechanical techniques, there is increasing evidence that restenosis can be prevented in certain subsets of patients by optimized balloon angioplasty, DCA and stenting as well as by the combined approach of primary tissue removal with adjunctive stent implantation.	0.5538762344379059
This article summarizes the mechanical techniques of restenosis prevention or reduction that have been documented in controlled trials.	0.5212545705788516
Additional pharmacologic interventions and possibly genetic and/or radiotherapeutic approaches will be highly important for future reduction of restenosis.	0.410812702589154
A safe closure of a dura lesion is necessary on account of the risk of potentially fatal (late) meningitis.	0.5079867966124961
161 duraplasties of the frontal skull base carried out from 1979 to 1994 at the ENT-department Fulda were evaluated in a retrospective study in regard to etiology, operative techniques and results.	0.6296115033958913
Duraplasty of the rhinobasis was indicated in 70 cases of rhinobasal trauma, 47 cases after paranasal sinus surgery, 36 cases of tumors and 8 malformations.	0.5193940900403604
After an average follow-up time of 6 years the patients were interviewed for postoperative liquorrhea, sinusitis treated with antibiotics and meningitis.	0.7604905844681618
As an objective measure to verify the tight closure of the treated CSF-leaks a fluoreszein test was performed in 50,9 % 6 to 8 weeks after the operation.	0.7156653058749863
Duraplasty was successfull in more than 96 %.	0.452286910256824
The approach and technique to perform a duraplasty have to be choosen individually considering size, location and etiology of the dural defect.	0.49432912372076204
In the majority of dural defects in the area of the frontal skull base reconstruction can be carried out now a days via an endonasal approach.	0.5509853244757159
By use of allogenic tissue, a mucosal flap from the surrounding area to cover the graft and fibrin clue good results were obtained.	0.6280776684796849
The tophus is a characteristic and pathognomonic sign of chronic gout.	0.508124279901355
Before effective drugs were available for the treatment of hyperuricaemia about 50 - 60% of patients with gout developed clinically and radiologically apparent urate crystal deposits.	0.6923754630145604
Clinical cutaneous manifestations of chronic gout are now rarely observed.	0.43017462510591203
However, the presence of degenerative tissues, as in idiopathic osteoarthritis of the fingers, may predispose to the deposition of urate crystals.	0.7265920977509176
We report on a patient with secondary - probably diuretic-induced - hyperuricaemia and gout tophi in Heberden's nodes.	0.571135644591727
HIV-1-associated encephalopathy (HIVE) remains an important manifestation of advanced HIV infection despite recent progress in antiretroviral therapy.	0.6148700218516325
This is in part due to particular pharmacological and virological characteristics of the central nervous system (CNS).	0.45864804413375065
HIVE is characterized by a "subcortical" dementia with psychomotor slowing as well as memory and concentration deficits.	0.46803334038095845
An invariable finding are deficits of central motor function.	0.2471447076428198
Pathogenetically, an enhanced viral replication in immunocompetent CNS cells is believed to be a requirement.	0.6074607536485099
This leads to neurotoxic effects directly elicited by viral products as well as indirectly by the immune response to virus infection.	0.4248734256694386
HIV-1 myelopathy (HIVM) is the other CNS manifestion of late HIV infection.	0.6317171029834961
The present consensus paper recommends diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in HIVE and HIVM and outlines the current research.	0.4474304310929499
Background: Prognostic data heart failure rely on epidemiological studies or large clinical trials.	0.40333165823622247
These data are not to transfer easily on everyday practice.	0.530854278509151
Forty-nine patients (mean age, 54 years) admitted for displaced ankle fractures were observed retrospectively to determine by clinical examination and measurement of plantar pressure distribution whether successful surgical treatment of ankle fractures had led to gait symmetry.	0.7184232155236066
The mean follow-up was 36 months (range, 19-54 months).	0.647718666276784
The deviation in gait was quantified using peak pressure.	0.2438656251166292
Using a clinical score, most of the patients had satisfactory results.	0.9403107909274268
The plantar pressure distribution showed significant load asymmetries of patients with satisfactory results and those with non-satisfactory results.	0.5097683534584108
Dynamic gait analysis allows quantification of gait asymmetry and clinically non-visible gait disorder.	0.32092761174689566
Comparison of radiation exposure applied by different types of CT scanners for the investigation of the chest and abdomen.	0.6123917867899938
Determination of radiation exposure applied by multi-phase spiral CT. Estimation of the dose in air in the system axis of the scanner, the CT dose index (CTDI) and the effective dose for electron beam tomography (EBT) and two conventional CT scanners (sequence, SEQ; spiral, SCT).	0.7043921041470461
For EBT, dose in system axis for investigation of the abdomen was above 50 mGy.	0.5189549275885371
Effective dose for investigation of the chest and abdomen was higher with EBT (11 and 26 mSv, respectively) than with conventional CT (SEQ, 4 and 20 mSv; SCT, 2 and 7 mSv).	0.7670321673887571
The effective dose for a biphasic investigation (liver 5 mSv, kidney 4 mSv) was below, for a triphasic investigation (liver 7 mSv) above the effective dose of the investigastion of the abdomen (6 mSv).	0.726989390669703
Investigation of the abdomen with the EBT should only be performed for certain indications.	0.7303910464829407
With spiral CT, effective dose is much lower than with EBT.	0.5519754822636487
Bone fracture, soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock are frequent complications in trauma patients, and these patients are known to be immunocompromised.	0.7818872899726771
Nonetheless, it is difficult to differentiate the effect of soft-tissue trauma plus hemorrhage from that of bone fracture and hemorrhage on host immune function in the clinical setting.	0.7257982713263386
To determine this experimentally, closed bone fracture (right lower leg) and/or soft-tissue trauma (2.5 cm midline laparotomy) were induced prior to hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial BP of 35  +/-  5 mm Hg for 90 min) in male C3H/HeN mice.	0.8043483960343536
All animals were killed at 72 h after initiation of the experiment and the spleens were collected aseptically.	0.4337680880690299
More significant depression of splenocyte IL-2 and IL-3 release occurred with the combined insult than after bony injury or tissue trauma alone with hemorrhage.	0.533299903797118
The present study suggests that different traumatic insults, i. e. bone fracture as well as soft-tissue trauma in conjunction with hemorrhagic shock, produce comparable depression of host immune function.	0.5700164452151106
Moreover, combination of closed bone fracture and soft-tissue trauma prior to hemorrhagic shock leads to even more compromised immunity.	0.5103261304861687
This indicates that different mechanisms of immune depression may be involved following soft-tissue trauma or bony injury coupled with hemorrhage.	0.4984248901711471
The markedly depressed immune function following bony injury, soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock may contribute to the increased susceptibility of severely injured patients to sepsis and the ensuing multiple organ failure in the clinical situation.	0.6817651548692044
In the management of acute major vessel occlusion, the use of fibrinolytic agents such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), urokinase or streptokinase is widely accepted.	0.4796341635115878
Today, the spectrum of indications for thrombolytic drugs comprises acute myocardial infarction, lung embolism, ischaemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis and acute arterial occlusions of the lower limbs.	0.7142214473169484
In view of the histopathological and clinical features of retinal vessel occlusion, fibrinolysis aimed at early restoration of blood flow appears to be a promising therapeutic approach.	0.6732665180740404
Basically, it is of some concern that the systemic administration of fibrinolytic agents is associated with a haemorrhagic risk.	0.653076696542498
Since this includes cerebral haemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding, the choice of an appropriate intravenous thrombolytic therapy in a non-life threatening situation such as central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) should be based on minimising the risk of adverse events.	0.621734064711788
Furthermore, the fibrinolytic treatment of choice should be able to produce rapid and complete restoration of retinal capillary and arterial or venous blood flow and maintain patency long enough for retinal salvage to take place.	0.5869136834221089
In this article, we review several studies of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with retinal vessel occlusion to determine whether this treatment is likely to improve major clinical outcomes.	0.7399388036017013
Moreover, we review the large scale trials of fibrinolysis in myocardial infarction and acute ischaemic stroke to evaluate safety and efficacy of various thrombolytic regimens.	0.5829222630927644
Furthermore, we report on our results of fibrinolytic therapy with low dose rt-PA in patients with retinal artery occlusion and ischaemic central retinal vein occlusion.	0.8329728232052116
In light of the fact that the occurrence of bleeding complications constitutes a dose dependent problem, we conclude that the use of low dose regimens should be the ideal approach to fibrinolysis in retinal vessel occlusion.	0.6323619643608002
Although the results of our pilot studies must be interpreted with caution, we believe that the administration of low-dose rt-PA (50 mg) in a frontloaded manner ( = simultaneous administration of rt-PA and intravenous heparin) constitutes a reasonable treatment option in patients with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or ischaemic retinal vein occlusion (RVO), recent onset of symptoms (CRAO <= 12 h, RVO <= 11 d) and severe visual loss ( <= 20/50).	0.8203413924105277
Because of these limitations and the numerous contraindications of fibrinolytic therapy, only a limited number of patients will be suitable for this treatment.	0.7566041866671026
In view of the poor visual and ocular prognosis in severe retinal vessel occlusion, controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the benefit of thrombolysis in the management of this disease.	0.7028677604426528
This study was designed to determine the relationship between the electroencephalogram (EEG) and clinical signs of depth of anaesthesia during induction of anaesthesia by slow infusion of propofol (18 mg/kg - h).	0.7881837906700266
The object of this study was to evaluate currently published data regarding extragenital neoplasia induced by HRT.	0.5492272685487504

In our case we could not confirm the previously reported ultrastructural findings.	0.5966820150535764
CRP is generally resistant to therapy.	0.2744165848771431
We treated a 19-year-old patient with typical CRP with oral minocycline.	0.6008408270964309
Within a few weeks the eruption resolved completely.	0.5405211363094458
A mild relapse 7 months later responded promptly to a repeated course of minocycline.	0.32988514019010623
Twelve months after discontinuatin of therapy there is no evidence of recurrence.	0.583603093783357
In CRP minocycline should be preferred to systemic retinoid therapy because of its minor side effects.	0.4565832791603988
Wound instillation seems to be an easy and preferable way to achieve postoperative analgesia in pediatric hernioplasty.	0.6081522205658502
This prospective, randomized and double-blinded pilot-study was initiated to gain preliminary information in order to define the appropriate concentration of local anaesthetic for efficient posthernioplastic analgesia.	0.6025991868822752
The recommended infusion time for i.v.	0.23669317496597017
prostaglandin E 1 (PGE1) therapy is 2 or 3 h, depending on the dose.	0.5617200362116652
The aim of the present multicentre study was to investigate, for the first time, whether the dose of 60 µg PGE1 is effective and well tolerated with shorter infusion times.	0.8824917311465996
A total of 118 patients with intermittent claudication and a pain-free walking distance between 50 and 200 m (3 km/h, 12%) were randomized to receive an i.v.	0.6904227570679764
infusion of 3 ampoules Prostavasin (60 µg PGE1) administered for either 1 or 2 h, once a day for 4 weeks.	0.6069471539351324
Primary variables were pain-free walking distance as well as safety, determined by the frequency of adverse events and the course of blood pressure.	0.67570748310604
The efficacy was comparable in the two groups.	0.45212690289214247
In the 1-h infusion group, the pain-free walking distance increased from 87 to 135 m, and in the 2-h group from 88 to 147 m, while the absolute walking distance increased from 124 to 200 m and from 147 to 238 m, respectively.	0.6870158142924672
The differences between the two groups were not significant, although an analysis of subgroups with initial pain-free walking distances of less than 80 m indicated a significant difference in favour of the 2-h PGE1 infusion (increase in walking distance 58 m as compared with 22 m).	0.6907956520516877
Course of blood pressure and frequency of adverse events were comparable in the two groups.	0.6881293117762637
Altogether, in intermittent claudication both the 1-h and the 2-h PGE1 infusion show comparably good results in terms of efficacy and safety.	0.677152649945732
Patients with an initial pain-free walking distance of less than 80 m seem to reveal a major benefit after a 2-h PGE1 infusion.	0.6142223753031193

Fractionated irradiation with X-rays or megavoltage is an important therapeutic option in the palliative treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma.	0.6579491380579251
We report on three HIV patients demonstrating bullous cutaneous eruptions in the irradiation field.	0.5822743069075216
Three homosexual men (age 45-60 y) stage of disease CDC 3C, were treated with fractionated soft X-rays with the scheme conventionally used by us (total dose 30 Gy, single doses 3 Gy).	0.6111429473565694
Immediately to three days after completion of treatment large blisters appeared within the irradiation field, resolving after 2-4 weeks, leaving postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.	0.509231294556227
The cause of this rare reaction to soft X-ray therapy, potentially suggesting an individually altered radiation sensitivity, is so far unknown.	0.7502635447872005
Controlled prospective studies applying different fractionation schemes will be necessary to better elucidate this issue.	0.4231725344557953
Due to the decreased trauma in anterior as well as posterior surgical approaches to the spine, microsurgical techniques have been used more frequently in recent years.	0.707914603382396
This article describes two new microsurgical techniques to approach the anterior lumbar spine for interbody fusion as part of a posterior-anterior stabilization concept in various diseases like spondylolisthesis, degenerative instability; failed back surgery syndrome, fractures etc.	0.5248561962019898
The lumbar segments L 2-5 are approached through a blunt muscle-splitting retroperitoneal technique.	0.4328503630938946

The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is the strongest ligament of the human knee joint.	0.7503709876806851
Its origin is at the lateral wall of the medial femoral condyle and the insertion is located in the posterior part of the intercondylar area.	0.7720029891285167
The posterior cruciate ligament consists of multiple small fiber bundles.	0.3350520215701611
From a functional point of view, one can differentiate fiber bundles with an anterior origin and fiber bundles with a posterior origin at the femur.	0.5800649065969065
The anterior fibers insert in the anterolateral part of the tibial insertion zone.	0.4756270228952553
These fibers become tense when the knee is flexed.	0.2115823691776287
The posterior fibers insert in the posteromedial part of the tibial insertion and become tense when the knee is extended.	0.47267105077560434
The main part of the posterior cruciate ligament consists of type I collagen positive dense connective tissue.	0.5632948957398055
The longitudinal fibrils of type I collagen are divided into small bundles by thin type III collagen positive fibrils.	0.41049596582467063
In the center of the middle third region, the structure of the tissue varies from the typical structure of a ligament.	0.703594768555488
In this region, the structure of the tissue resembles fibrocartilage.	0.7654102383853754
Oval-shaped cells surrounded by a metachromatic extracellular matrix lie between the longitudinal collagen fibrils.	0.38587622365183616
The femoral origin and the tibial insertion have the structure of chondral apophyseal enthesis.	0.525356939476746
Near the anchoring region at the femur and tibia there should be various mechanoreceptors which might have an important function for the kinematics of the knee joint.	0.5923830000969303
The blood supply of the PCL arises from the middle geniculate artery.	0.5804586557286618
The ligament is covered by a synovial fold where the terminal branches of the middle and the inferior geniculate artery form a periligamentous network.	0.5671960703103452
From the synovial sheath, the blood vessels penetrate the ligament in a transverse direction and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network.	0.4914320412395356
The distribution of blood vessels within the PCL is not homogeneous.	0.489844736760495
We detected three avascular areas within the ligament: Both fibrocartilaginous entheses of the PCL are devoid of blood vessels.	0.42380922743604327
A third avascular zone is located in the central zone of fibrocartilage of the middle third region.	0.5083051387686955
Atrial reentrant tachycardias (ART) are a potentially life-threatening complication in survivors of congenital heart disease surgery.	0.6587839432366803
From July 1993 to December 1997, temporary transesophageal pacing was used to convert 29 tachycardia episodes in 19 patients.	0.48301096805526184
At the time of the first tachycardia episode, patients' ages were 1 month to 26 years (mean 9.8 yrs).	0.8279131843883442
Time from operation to onset of first tachycardia episode ranged from 1 day to 19 years.	0.4209539570991198
Onset was within the first 2 weeks postoperatively in 6 patients and occurred later in 13 patients (1 to 19 years after operation).	0.8122813908460789
Postoperative pacemaker implantation had been performed in 2 pts; 17 of 19 pts were receiving antiarrhythmic medication.	0.523729424527246
After placing a quadripolar transesophageal catheter, atrial and ventricular signals were recorded and atrial stimulation performed.	0.374882874830584
Atrial cycle length of tachycardia ranged from 160-380 ms with 1:1 to 4:1 AV conduction.	0.49405777557851366
Temporary transesophageal pacing was performed following an algorithm starting with 4 extrastimuli (20 ms below atrial cycle length of tachycardia).	0.45979333489274476
Tachycardia terminated in 27 of 29 cases (93%) without complications.	0.5609208008049578
In 3 cases, conversion was achieved by pacing after amiodarone 5 mg/kg i.v.	0.5428449614422661
After tachycardia conversion, sinus- or pacemaker rhythm was present in 20 cases.	0.6005024507558736
In 9 cases atrial fibrillation was recorded; spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm occurred after a maximum of 3 min (7 cases) or persisted and required direct current cardioversion (2 cases).	0.7288698585830476
In conclusion, transesophageal atrial pacing is an effective, relatively noninvasive method for conversion of atrial reentrant tachycardias after operation for congenital heart disease.	0.507602631331222
After elucidating the components and theory of neuroticism (N) as well as of psychosomatic complaints and their relationships to personality dimensions and to psychosomatic diseases, comparisons are performed between patients suffering from fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) or related pain diseases with healthy subjects scoring high on personality dimensions related to neuroticism.	0.5520068276724374
FMS and pain patients score high on depression, anxiety, and experience of stress although questionnaire scores on depression are higher in subjects not exhibiting somatic features of the disease.	0.5332999252182283
High subjective pain sensitivity and low thresholds for pain perception are also common features in high N subjects and FMS patients.	0.4098831717377234
On the endocrinological level cortisol responses to challenge tests with CRH as well as prolactin responses to TRH are higher in FMS patients than in high N healthy subjects indicating an endocrinological difference.	0.41873446817153104
A common feature, however, is the lack of adapatability in the two groups, since neurotics are in particular characterized by a low capacity to shift their behavior from one state to the other (waking-sleeping, working-relaxing), to re-adapt to baseline levels after endocrinological or physiological stress responses, or to adjust to conditions of shift work.	0.6125176623698194
This is reflected by chronobiological disturbances in FMS patients and could also explain their maintainance of pain perception, because they are incapable of correcting conditioned pain-producing muscle tension.	0.5049263547981238
Purpose: To document our experience with spiral hydro-CT of the pancreas based on a combination of pharmacologic intestinal paralysis and water distension of the stomach and duodenum with specific reference to tumor detection rate, differentiation of malignant versus benign tumors and assessment of tumor resectability in a prospective study on 211 consecutive patients.	0.6261309495175339
Since the publication of a case of Syphilis transmission by blood transfusion in 1915 the discussion about transfusion-associated bacterial infection is ongoing.	0.5591980027475019
For some time, virus infections through blood and blood products have been highlighted.	0.44780316954092236
However, in the last years the attention required has been drawn to the problem of transmission of bacteria.	0.8425191159425077
In this publication the present situation concerning the contamination rates through blood components and the frequency of transfusion-associated microbial infections is outlined.	0.4527570152121318

While working to develop a distal locking device, we analyzed distal nail position with reference to nail deformation and a radiographic-morphometric investigation.	0.5897160511546592
The amount and the direction of implant deformation in unslotted stainless steel unreamed tibial nails (Synthes) were analyzed.	0.5535419879913435
Measurement of implant deformation (3 translations, 3 angles) in the center of the distal transverse locking hole was performed with a 3D magnetic motion tracker system before and after nail insertion.	0.7680455409263247
Unreamed tibial nails (diameter 8 mm, n = 10; diameter 9 mm, n = 10) were inserted in paired human cadaver tibiae.	0.5857041450699724
The results showed lateral translations of -4.5+/-3.5 mm (mean and standard deviation, range 14.3 mm) and dorsal translations of -7.8+/-5.8 mm (mean and standard deviation, range 19.2 mm).	0.9506033953054227
Rotational deformations around the longitudinal axis of the nail were 0.3+/-0.7 ° (mean and standard deviation, range 2.4 °).	0.7275989995961935
The results showed, that a simple aiming arm, mounted on the proximal nail end, alone or even in combination with a large working channel (e.g.	0.6010433404283972
10 mm in diameter), was not adequate to the aiming process.	0.7006794880015812
A radiographic-morphometric analysis was subsequently performed in 40 tibiae after experimental (n = 20) or clinical (n = 20) implantation of nails 8 mm and 9 mm in diameter.	0.5137443458727078
These measurements showed a relatively constant distance between the upper distal transverse hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia (average 12.3 mm and only a narrow range (7.6 mm).	0.7379994864697518
These data were the basis for the development of an aiming technique that exploits the relatively constant distance between the distal nail hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia.	0.635794252835629

Five-hundred and one participants from the Leipzig region were compared with 500 participants from the Heidelberg area on four specific dimensions: personality, cognitive functioning, subjective well-being, and health.	0.6017267462165273
Age differences were obtained for neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness.	0.5693595827290151
Differences were also obtained in cognitive functioning and health.	0.3984849281781161
Regional differences between eastern and western Germany were obtained in the personality dimensions neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness, as well as in subjective well-being.	0.5912429989240271
Significant age by region interactions were obtained for openness and some of the cognitive measures, as well as for the physicians' health ratings of the participants, suggesting selective historical effects.	0.5758014537336545
The results are discussed with respect to functional abilities and levels of satisfaction in midlife, as well as with respect to regional differences that might be due to prior political system differences in the east and west.	0.5664719903481837
Modern obstetrics must try to maintain high safety standards for both mother and child and, at the same time, satisfy the general desire of women for natural birth.	0.5237146459868762
Standards of safety are based on early recognition of high risks, allowing early intervention to prevent serious complications.	0.5352812252076454
A considerable number of diagnostic and therapeutic measures recommended on a prophylactic basis and therefore widely used are responsible for the medical-technical image associated with modern obstetrics.	0.6081032026161644
The benefits of most of these prophylactically recommended activities are unproven or low relative to the unavoidable side effects and the costs associated with widespread application.	0.565191107808681
There is good scientific proof that routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring during labor and delivery is associated with an increase in the rate of cesarean sections as well as operative vaginal deliveries without any clear benefit to the newborn in terms of a decrease in mortality or morbidity.	0.6100276370830938
In a population of healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies, the prevalence of perinatal mortality or morbidity is so low that even with meta-analysis of several studies the numbers remain too small to show significant differences for these rare events.	0.6408833947540731
In high-risk cases the routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring throughout labor and delivery is undisputed and leads to a significant drop in morbiditiy and mortality of the baby.	0.6598449372777093
With careful selection of pregnant women a combination of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and auscultation during certain segments of the first stage of labor provides adequate surveillance.	0.5300167964620579

Epileptic seizures may alter autonomic functions.	0.20449588737630228
This is especially the case with complex focal seizures (of temporal lobe origin) and grand mal.	0.640401064926946
Most frequently, such seizures cause ictal tachycardia, sometimes tachypnea, probably caused by the propagation of epileptic discharges to autonomic cerebral structures.	0.5773670797495182
Ictal bradycardia and asystole are rare phenomena.	0.2415871085315603
However, they may be life threatening.	0.7822672611239676
Their differentiation from primary cardiac arrest is possible by the use of ictal EEG and ECG registration.	0.46417135366296475
Postictal serum prolactin measurement does not differentiate syncope from seizure.	0.22982569975715048
However, a postictal increase of creatine kinase is only measured after epileptic seizures and not after syncope.	0.4723054619517836
Treatment of such epileptic seizures includes an optimization of anticonvulsant drug therapy and the implantation of a cardiac demand stimulator.	0.6381513802887502

Under-recognition and the tumour's bland cytologic features lead to frequent misdiagnoses.	0.29868136737262957
In addition, subclinical tumour invasion explains the high incidence of local recurrence.	0.4124821389623964
Thus, the tumour makes great demands on the planning of its surgical removal.	0.589755304024526
We report the case of an 81-year-old woman with a microcystic adnexal carcinoma of the lower lip, which was treated by micrographic surgery.	0.8992880712628667

Posttraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is associated with a poor outcome.	0.555546265962676
When evaluating the literature according to the Utstein method, there were only 2 survivors (0.18%) out of 1,135 CPR attempts after trauma (Table 1).	0.6612292047185018
Differences in the study populations and levels of prehospital trauma care led us to analyse the results of a physician-staffed prehospital trauma care system in Cologne.	0.7056527815115278
From January 1987 to December 1990, a total of 49,054 emergency calls were registered using a standardised protocol.	0.5904932521145726
Among 9,595 trauma-related calls, 636 patients were found to be pulseless on arrival of the emergency team, 412 of these were pronounced dead.	0.5010136693640705
CPR was initiated in the remaining 224 patients, who comprise the study population (defined as 100%).	0.6592957508289815
All patients who were admitted to a hospital were followed using a second protocol.	0.7587245134185531
CPR in the field was successful in 68 (30.4%) patients, who were then admitted to a hospital; 42 of these died within the first 24 h. Four patients (1.8%) could be discharged from hospital alive and were still living 1 year later, 1 with a lasting neurological deficit (Fig.	0.8356928123004995
In 156 (69.6%) cases resuscitative attempts were unsuccessful in the field.	0.5702547782837364
Even in a physician-staffed prehospital trauma care system, the chance of surviving a post-traumatic cardiac arrest is minimal.	0.5855735817940443
Survival has to be regarded as an individual fate; the overall results are discouraging.	0.7432094736559846
Even though this study analyses the largest population of posttraumatic CPR ever published, prognostic factors could not be identified due to the few survivors.	0.5521964772391713
Nevertheless, the result does not justify general omission of CPR after trauma as: (1) prognostic factors for survival have not been identified thus far; and (2) no significant additional costs arise from posttraumatic CPR.	0.6979006978330854
Functional voiding disturbances can be due to failure of the detrusor or to discoordinated sphincter function during micturition.	0.4078369968407517
Therapeutical options are directed either to strengthening the contraction up to an adequate magnitude or to lowering the voiding resistance or can be aimed at influencing both.	0.4109907767434979
In a brief survey mechanical, pedagogical, electrotherapeutical, and surgical measures as well as drug treatment are critically examined.	0.5715916241814539
Conservative methods should always be attempted before surgical procedures are performed.	0.4973126317388263
Depending on the degree of severity and the etiology of the disease, a combined therapy can be useful.	0.8674806096071469
In the case of resistance to therapy, intermittent autocatheterism is to be preferred to permanent deviation via an indwelling catheter.	0.5902235733394479
During long-term therapy of hyperuricaemia with allopurinol (300 mg/d) two patients developed generalized granuloma annulare.	0.5839237129457492
The diagnoses were confirmed by histology; concomitant diseases, especially diabetes mellitus, were not detectable.	0.7122229335639265
Following discontinuation of allopurinol therapy, cutaneous granulomas healed without relapse.	0.39443787263835256
Hyperuricaemia could be controlled by low-purine diet and medication avoiding allopurinol.	0.42213616250705416
The clinical history of our two patients suggested a causal connection between allopurinol therapy and generalized granuloma annulare.	0.47941305111377386
For this reason we rate the development of this disease in both cases as a rare but significant side effect of allopurinol.	0.8557018557899015
This should give rise to critical assessment of concomitant drug therapy during development of generalized granuloma annulare.	0.4035043303356993
Background: Aim of the present prospective longitudinal study was the statistical foundation and thus further replication of recent findings of Hasenbring [13], who postulated a significant importance of specific, within the psychological pain research long neglected pain coping strategies as risk factors concerning pain chronification: appeals to "stick it out" on the cognitive level and endurance strategies on the behavioural level.	0.5875264311997649
Intraarticular bleeding and muscle bleeding occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma in hemophilia A or B.	0.42943182610267544
The most common sites for hemarthrosis are the knees joints, elbows and ankles joints.	0.5057683017923471
Resorption of intraarticular blood induces reactive hemophilic synovitis.	0.2466644370850951
Hyperplasia of the synovium can be followed by recurrent bleedings.	0.4906378345458315
These early reactions can change to a chronic synovitis and cause cartilage damage, finally resulting in a complete destruction of the joint.	0.6180163975049711
Since 1981 158 adults and 61 children with a hemophilia A or B were treated at the Center for hemophilic disorders Frankfurt in an interdisciplinary approach.	0.5061702049752709
Consequent prophylactic treatment with factor substitution can prevent the incidence of severe hemarthrosis.	0.46603541782763136
Minor joint bleedings are treated by adequate factor substitution, temporarily non-weight bearing of the extremity, application of ice-packs and physical therapy.	0.5169288131066221
More severe joint hemorrhages should be aspirated in order to reduce the acute synovitis.	0.47393256664504196
This is followed by a consequent physical therapy (joint and soft tissue techniques) and anti-inflammatory drugs.	0.6472108951251635
The goal is a sufficient muscular balance of the joint, the improvement of the coordination, and the proprioception.	0.8587810587783098
The chronic synovitis is less painful and poorly responses to conservative interventions.	0.3709149595876467
Local ice application, sytemic and local anti-inflammatory treatment support the physical therapy.	0.4225784557410775
Soft heel shock absorber, elastic and semi-rigid bandages prevent recurrent bleeding episodes by shock absorption and decrease of synovial impingement.	0.3337515661011515
Synovectomy is indicated in cases of chronic persistent synovitis.	0.5550351041398089
Radiosynoviorthesis (RSO), which is an alternative in certain cases, has been performed with great success in 12 cases in our hospital.	0.8093979501514558
In advanced arthropathy joint mobilization should be the emphasis of the physical therapy.	0.5115951081922648
Bandages, crutches and ortopaedic shoe devices improve the walking capacity.	0.2267331270673856
Over an 18-month period findings of stress X-ray of the ankle and medical records of 112 cases were analyzed retrospectively as to indications, results and therapeutic consequences.	0.6695297437746331
The analysis showed that critical setting of indications can reduce the frequency of stress X-ray of the ankle and thus lower the total costs.	0.6438335891406352

A 72-year-old patient received 0.1 mg morphine by the intrathecal route and 2x1.5 mg midazolam as adjuvant therapy.	0.665037063103359
Severe respiratory depression and somnolence supervened 3.5 h later, which lasted over the next 24 h and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.	0.6645178758441982
Continuous administration of >6 mg naloxone to antagonize the supposed effect of the morphine had no effect.	0.5025421796109645
The patient's condition was not normalized until a single dose of 0.3 mg flumazenil was administered.	0.7632446345786986
For the time being, especially in the case of elderly patients, we recommend that strict indications are adhered to when intrathecal administration of morphine is considered and that less than 0.1 mg morphine is given.	0.7748295301077283
Respiration should be monitored for quite some time.	0.3804882177209977
In contrast to the often debated NYHA classification, the determination of peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) by cardiopulmonary exercise testing allows an objective assessment of the exercise capacity of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).	0.6370676016806531
However, cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a time consuming and costly diagnostic tool, which requires sophisticated equipment and specially trained personell.	0.6359315332495192
Exercise capacity can also be determined by the 6 minute walk test.	0.5122226034936241
This test simply measures the distance covered by strong walking on a hallway level within 6 minutes.	0.381855555010967
The 6 minute walk test is a submaximal exercise test, which is associated with much smaller increments in heart rate, blood pressure and plasma catecholamines than cardiopulmonary exercise testing.	0.6569748555220242
It is characterized by a very small intraindividual variance.	0.5033738162576288
Furthermore, it can be easily performed and, due to low logistic and personal requirements, it is very cost effective.	0.6968986501446669
The results of the 6 minute walk test - as well as of cardiopulmonary exercise testing - are influenced by extracardial exercise-limiting disorders, such as pulmonary diseases.	0.6862928108105109
Independent from the etiology of CHF, the results of the 6 minute walk test are closely related to peak VO2.	0.6617508843881563
In serial exercise testing the distance covered within 6 minutes allow to predict the individual peak VO2.	0.49240265189745663
Like peak VO2 the 6 minute walk test has been shown to be a predictor of morbidity and mortality in CHF, with its predictive value being independent from left ventricular ejection fraction and other potential prognostic parameters.	0.645512477626671
In CHF patients a walking distance < 300 m is associated with a one-year-mortality of up to 50%, whereas the one-year-mortality in patients reaching a walking distance > 450 m amounts to only a few percent.	0.8457817015787332
In addition, the hospitalization rate of patients reaching a walking distance of < 300 m is several fold higher than in those with a walking distance >= 450 m. Like cardiopulmonary exercise testing, the 6 minute walk test allows to control the efficiency of specific treatments and to monitor the natural course of the disease.	0.7030427859802573
The 6 minute walk test is, thus, a cost effective alternative to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in CHF patients.	0.5720667936771253
However, neither the 6 minute walk test alone nor the results of cardiopulmonary exercise testing alone are sufficient for selecting patients, e.g., for cardiac transplantation, as each individual case requires a synopsis of all relevant facts and parameters.	0.6248699586193632
We report the first case of prurigo pigmentosa in the German literature.	0.7447308450926459
For over a year, a 16-year old white girl developed an immensely pruritic symmetrical reticular, papulo-vesicular eruption on the trunk, axillae and pubic region.	0.48496882740592673
Histologically a superficial  perivascular spongiotic and lichenoid  inflammatory pattern with prominent pigmentary incontinence in older lesions was observed.	0.37460065617957733
Topical corticosteroids and  systemic antihistamines had no effect.	0.3525752448462075
Systemic corticosteroids and diaminophenylsulphone (DADPS) produced improvement but could not prevent recurrences.	0.3665349192407086
Healing  occurred only after 4 weeks of systemic- minocycline.	0.5114017285835298
Following parenteral administration, clonidine has analgesic effects at both cerebral and spinal levels.	0.3718706057541226
Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) makes it possible to determine equipotent dosages of analgesics by relating analgesic consumption per time to the levels of analgesia obtained in comparable patient populations.	0.48793810501364276
Therefore, we studied the equipotency ratios of clonidine and piritramide and the incidence of undesired side effects in the treatment of postoperative pain in patients undergoing maxillo-facial surgery.	0.7008525627280389
The effects of glycerol are discussed in detail.	0.4837646132238818
Glycerol can lead to a transition of crystalline lipid structures within the horny layer lipids into liquid crystalline states.	0.4227081616151203
Especially if applied in oil/water-emulsions it improves, the hydration of the horny layers better than urea.	0.4649302389226285
In addition, if facilitates the dissolution of desmosomes within the superior layers of the horny layer enhancing desquamation.	0.4782014326806055
Furthermore, by using glycerol, the mechanical properties of the skin can be influenced; long term used leads to increased elasticity.	0.8009360430992385
The roughness of the horny layer is reduced, which can be explained by the abrasive and/or the hydrating effect.	0.662291432528946
Glycerol used in o/w-emulsions also protects against the influence of tensides or noxious lipophilic agents.	0.3195839926514605
Presumably a flux from the base of the epidermis towards its surface triggers the regeneration of the barrier.	0.4596827093843364
Finally,  glycerol can lead - similarly to urea - to an improvement in active agent penetration, as has been proven for hexylnicotinate.	0.8426078820394304
Background: An 18-year-old woman presented with thyrotoxic symptoms - right sided lid retraction and exophthalmus.	0.6727469011690733
She complained of diplopia on lateral gaze.	0.1933333219399357
Laboratory investigations confirmed Grave's disease with hyperthyroidism and TSH receptor antibodies.	0.25089326964252384
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.	0.6289455325710848
The safe and effective treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias is being intensively studied.	0.7258255594513184
Internal electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation has been shown to be an effective non-pharmacological treatment option.	0.7506562156769813
Cardioversion therapy has been applied in the absence of a clear understanding of the mechanisms governing the process.	0.6116660732557722
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using sophisticated optical mapping techniques reveal that internal cardioversion shocks cause changes in repolarization time that favor annihilation of wave fronts.	0.2997058920016527
Thus, mechanisms of atrial cardioversion appear to be similar to ventricular defibrillation.	0.45893863738089596
Further studies are needed to determine whether cardioversion mechanisms differ for chronic atrial fibrillation compared to acute atrial fibrillation.	0.49503679037299253
Plasmocytic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common tumor of bone and bone marrow, typically diagnosed by symptoms such as monoclonal paraproteinemia, proteinuria, anemia and hypercalcemia.	0.6031215587399784
In its progress, deposits of amyloids in  almost all organs can be observed.	0.4503717949836073
However, plasmacytomas which are diagnosed by macroglossia of primarily unknown etiology are rare.	0.39356130282469315
This case report presents a 61-year-old woman who suffered from a persistent swelling of the tongue with painful ulcerations.	0.7079319118600765
A biopsy led to the diagnosis of primary systemic amyloidosis of the light-chain type, which subsequently proved to be a plasmacytoma with lambda light-chains stage II after Durie and Salmon.	0.634602638572812
In the course of the disease the patient developed further deposits of amyloids in the whole gastro-enteric system.	0.66975984985396
Macroglossia as a primary manifestation of plasmacytoma is rarely described in medical literature.	0.4660815641901947
However, reports on deposits of amyloid in the tongue in advanced stages of disease are well known.	0.6379509629751816
Aim: Improved detection of pulmonary-venous pathologies by imaging the pulmonary veins without arterial overlay.	0.48253770314469624
For the histological verification of suspicious non-palpable small breast tumors, the three-dimensional breast biopsy applied as cylindrical extirpation using the ABBI system is the optimal solution at present.	0.5447124949416642
Because of the possibility of performing mammography during the operation, errors of localization can be corrected and incorrect incisions avoided.	0.4987858665173582
Taking the three radiomorphologically leading symptoms into consideration - suspicious microcalcification, focal shadow and structural irregularity - it can be stated that the digital mammography of the ABBI system is more sensitive than the conventional one for detecting microcalcification, but focal shadow and structural irregularity are detected less well by digital technique.	0.5695515998029439
These structures should be preoperatively marked by using sonography.	0.33699786327140313
After the complete removal of suspicious microcalcification checked by digital mammography during the operation, residual tumor might be found in a second excision when histologically invasive or intraductal tumor terminations reach the excision margin (R1 resection).	0.5524306350876087
Thirteen invasive and 8 intraductal carcinomas were found in 80 cases of cylindrical extirpation using the ABBI system.	0.4423246797481583
In 7 procedures carried out to exclude an in-breast recurrence, 3 intraductal carcinomas and 1 invasive carcinoma were observed.	0.5805605481464732
In 8 of 12 invasive carcinomas and in 1 of 5 intraductal carcinomas, breast-conserving therapy was indicated.	0.6014006230583849
Two cases of invasive carcinoma fulfilled the criteria applied (minimal tumor-free margin > 2 mm, no extensive intraductal component) to use the ABBI cylinder as lumpectomy without a second excision to follow.	0.7460110863019237
With the increasing number of patients surviving after therapeutic intervention for congenital heart disease (CHD), accurate and frequent follow-up of their morphologic and functional cardiovascular status is required, preferably with a noninvasive imaging technique.	0.6456025313413177
In a retrospecitve multicenter study we followed-up 30 fractures of the neck of the femur in children aged 11 years (1.5-15 years) for 4.8 years (0.5-20.0 years).	0.9097663291037701
It is the aim of this study to analyse factors possibly related to outcome, like age at injury, type of fracture, interval between injury and treatment, method of stabilization and postoperative interval until full weight bearing.	0.6913621156969132
At follow-up subjective parameters (pain, weather sensitiveness), clinical parameters (range of motion, claudication, leg length discrepancies) and radiological parameters (hip series) were investigated and medical charts and roentgenograms were reviewed using a standardized protocol.	0.7219805558323603
29 of 30 children (96.7 %) have sustained displaced fractures.	0.6524667050775261
Non-operative treatment has been applied in 4 children.	0.7316528184585468
26 femoral neck fractures (type I: 1, type II: 8, type III: 17) were stabilized by internal fixation using screws and/or pins.	0.8111056842988942
Following non-operative treatment one child suffered a coxa vara and another child suffered a avascular femoral head necrosis in combination with coxa vara and leg length shortening of 4 cm.	0.5560708351780497
Following operative treatment 9 of 26 children (34.6 %) sufferred a avascular femoral head necrosis and 3 children (11.5 %) suffered a coxa vara.	0.6495089701982256
In 6 of 26 children (23 %) we observed leg length discrepancies > 2 cm.	0.7411800689389553
We were not able to demonstrate any significant follow-up result differencies between the groups of children who have sustained type II or type III fractures, or between the groups of children aged < 10 years when compared to children aged > 10 years, or between the group of children who were operated on within 6 hours after the accident when compared to the group of children operated > 6 hours after the accident.	0.8120378466336423
We observed no significant follow-up result differences between the groups of children who had different intervals between operation and full weight bearing.	0.582598997489891
Operative fracture management remains the treatment of choice in the majority of displaced femoral neck fractures in children.	0.6506778759647646
However, in our limited study we were not able to demonstrate any significant follow-up result differences between the group of children treated by immediate open reduction and internal fixation (interval injury - operation < 6 hours) when compared to children who had been operated > 6 hours after the injury.	0.8141889674705972
Evidence based standards for structure quality in out-patient management of chronic pain states do not exist.	0.5897201088173485
Therefore we tried to evaluate if german standards for outpatient management of chronic pain states which are based on opinions of experts for pain management influence the outcome quality of independent physicians for treatment of chronic low back pain.	0.6844659294951592
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare low dose dopamine and dopexamine with respect to of liver-venous oxygen saturation, oxygen delivery and - demand, liver function tests and cardiocirculatory effects  in the reperfusion period during a hemihepatectomy operation with occlusion of the liver hilus.	0.6908594882320173
Facial trauma is frequent and mainly caused by motor vehicle accidents.	0.35243948131854713
Due to this main etiologic factor, trauma to the facial skeleton is often associated with serious injuries, commonly involving the brain, chest or abdomen.	0.5573837455777256
As a consequence, the initial clinical management of these patients includes control of hemorrhage and immediate assessment of life-threatening injuries, including the maintenance of the airways.	0.887966044873691
Patients presenting with facial trauma are initially evaluated with a systematic clinical examination because many fractures can be accurately diagnosed by inspection and palpation alone.	0.44987589569106196
In these cases plain film radiographs serve only for confirmation and documentation of the diagnosis.	0.6473087557918678
In many other cases accompanying and extensive soft tissue swelling may clinically obscure fractures.	0.36812333735256886
A complete and accurate evaluation of these patients requires additional radiological imaging methods.	0.5713748553431779
A series of plain films may be generally sufficient but in most of the cases they can be regarded as initial screening methods for more thorough diagnosis with computed tomography (CT).	0.561936543407083
In trauma patients CT is the imaging method of choice because it shows more fracture lines and displaced fragments than any other imaging modality.	0.5690766229289733
CT delineates soft tissue and bony structures and can localize and even characterize foreign bodies.	0.4254190317120917
A complete and accurate characterization of the fracture type and potentially associated complications is mandatory for the appropriate treatment and can only be achieved by careful radiological (CT) evaluation.	0.6995949787363293
On the basis of the claims data of the statutory health insurance funds, surgery rates and small-area variations within the catchment area of the AOK Magdeburg were examined for the year 1997.	0.6357763413312951
Substantial variation can be constantly seen.	0.1983158497319209
The extremal quotient at the 30 most frequent ICPM groups ranged from 2 to 5.	0.3219497826964749
Generally, the extent of the variation was larger with elective procedures than with acute.	0.5469140099058709
Correlation analyses do not show clear associations with hospital bed supply and physician density in primary sectors.	0.34055202544331786
The extent of the small-area variation requires further research to evaluate possible determinants of surgery rates.	0.6589639825112835
Criteria for hospital admission and indications for surgery should be made explicit.	0.6223488674750924
Between 1984 and 1994 the legally required task force "Advisory Committee to the German Federal Health Office in Matters of Approval and Review of Existing Medicines B3-Psychiatry, Neurology, Anesthesiology" analyzed and evaluated the CNS-active compounds that until then had only possessed a fictitious registration.	0.4400604488803943
The evaluation was related to efficacy and safety within the indications claimed by the producers.	0.4822934040627878
Reviews and monographies had to be established for 445 basic compounds.	0.47109706585699646
One hundred positive and 30 negative monographies were published.	0.284747700498143
"Negative" indicates that none of the claimed indications could be accepted by the committee.	0.42272863331904686
It is regrettable that the Federal Health Agency did not notice a considerable part of these negative evaluations until the present date.	0.3919893146764878
The process of the "Aufbereitung" was stopped abruptly by the 5th amendment of the German Drug Law in August 1994, - a very doubtful political decision with respect to drug safety in this country.	0.7068686743861908
Background: We attempted to illustrate connections between selected metabolic parameters and the inflammation course in patients after cataract operations.	0.5891049805926266
Without a more detailed knowledge of etiology and pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis final conclusions regarding an association between physical trauma and the onset or course of multiple sclerosis cannot be drawn.	0.5780156605896491
Only a few prospective studies which are appropriately designed to prove a putative correlation have been published.	0.5673697093489916
A critical review of these studies and some case reports, in the light of the current pathophysiological concepts of multiple sclerosis, does not indicate a causal relationship between physical trauma and onset of multiple sclerosis or exacerbations.	0.694983731680094
We report on unusual presentation forms of Pneumocystis carinii infection of the lung in two patients with AIDS.	0.7627143067608028
A 36-years-old woman presented a cavitation in the lung middle lobe and bullous changes in the apical portion of the right upper lobe on the chest x-ray.	0.6601953800660274
The biopsy of these lesions was not diagnostic and the patient was operated on.	0.8231633426027616
The surgical specimen of the removed lung segment showed a cavitary lesion with a border of granulation tissue with giant cells, focal recent and older hemorrhages, rests of fibrinous exudate and dystrophic calcifications.	0.38709797695431214
In the surrounding tissue there were Pneumocystis carinii in the alveolar spaces and also in the alveolar walls, this tissue invasion through the organisms being most probably the cause of the cavitary change.	0.6310850171058773
A cytomegalic virus infection was also found.	0.4023030672376622
In aortic atresia, coronary perfusion normally occurs through retrograde blood flow in the ascending aorta.	0.4840003640866728
We report on two patients with antegrade flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia.	0.4981906863108149
In one patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (aortic atresia, severe mitral stenosis), an intact interatrial septum/premature closure of the foramen ovale was found.	0.5960892605267695
While no other way of left atrial or ventricular decompression was found, echocardiography, angiography and the post-mortem examination showed left ventricular to coronary sinusoids as the sole pathway for systemic oxygenation.	0.5166361591560963
In a second patient with complex congenital heart disease, including aortic atresia, antegrade flow in the ascending aorta was through a left coronary fistula with shunt flow originating from the pulmonary trunc.	0.6031292547066374
This report describes systemic perfusion depending on retrograde coronary flow due to coronary-cameral (sinusoids) and coronary arterio-venous fistulas leading to the phenomenon of antegrade blood flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia.	0.5315407893169255
The introduction of biosensor technology for near bedside measurement of plasma lactate concentrations has been a promising step for critical care profiling.	0.4592930312894157
However, methodological drawbacks and relevant inaccuracy have been reported.	0.3831146678371909
With the advent of a new biosensor (Chiron Diagnostics) and a revised NOVA Biomedical device, accuracy was expected to be improved.	0.6796005735026222
The goal of the present investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of both methods.	0.8197301608987043
The combined histological and microcomputed analysis of human iliac crest biopsies leads to major advances in our understanding of three-dimensional bone architecture.	0.42775174992470755
Microcomputed tomography avoids the time-consuming reconstruction and artifacts of serial sections.	0.4096700624690719
Furthermore, its high resolution allows the recording of structural differences as low as 10 mm.	0.5290107263903369
Thus, three-dimensional analysis in combination with histological evaluation of cellular dynamics facilitates earlier and easier recording of changes of cancellous bone.	0.5084538386144983
The aneurysmal bone cyst represents a tumorlike lesion, which does not occur frequently.	0.5183696715985683
Every site of the skeleton may be involved.	0.6186643208406052
Although it can be observed at any age, it distinctly predominates from 10 to 20 years of age.	0.7333633474656345
Distinction of aneurysmatic bone cysts from certain benign or malignant bone tumours requires subtle imaging techniques and an experienced bone tumour pathologist.	0.4220015478349283
Since the lesion shows a heterogeneous biological behaviour and typically occurs in the growing skeleton, a wide range of surgical procedures must be provided concerning tumour resection and defect reconstruction.	0.637188423865733
In the current retrospective study results of 41 surgically treated aneurysmal bone cysts, thereof 5 latent, 31 active, and 5 aggressive lesions, were investigated.	0.7208220817089434
While morbidity due to the therapeutic measures was comparatively low even in extended lesions and demanding reconstructions, a recurrence rate of 19.5% had to be observed in our series.	0.7387347331314271
Taking into consideration the biological activity of the lesion, analysis of the recurrences revealed inappropriate surgical margins had been chosen at the primary operation in all of these patients.	0.7133961775296115
Since the risk of a local relapse is linked both to aggressiveness of the primary lesion and to surgical radicality, therapy of aneurysmal bone cyst requires preoperative staging and stage-dependent surgical procedures.	0.6432863160539053
The RS3PE syndrome (Remitting Seronegative Symmetrical Synovitis with Pitting Edema) is a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis in the elderly with a good prognosis.	0.6274901707439496
It usually presents as an acute, symmetric polysynovitis with edema of the dorsum of the hands and feet.	0.3928193046106256
Anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids leads to prompt improvement.	0.46401026829001035
We describe the case of an 81 year old man with a primarily unilateral manifestation involving the right hand.	0.6964993003797667
A thrombosis of the axillary vein was suspected.	0.46651309942505775
Within a few days he developed a pitting edema of the dorsum of the other hand.	0.695844721255933
Movement of both shoulders and wrists was painful.	0.3690652253829159
Low-dose corticosteroid therapy resulted in a rapid improvement of the edema and the inflammatory symptoms.	0.7015066135716734
The objective of this study was to determine the usefulness, safety and acceptance of a new technique of percutaneous implantation of port-catheter-systems (PIPS) for locoregional intraarterial chemotherapy of the liver.	0.724679031167423
From October 1994 to July 1996, 128 patients (30 women, 98 men) participated in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program (phase II).	0.5868983207590969
Our objectives were to demonstrate risk-factor modification and increased work-load capacity resulting directly from the rehabilitation in terms of primary results and long-term effects, 6 months (n = 59) and 12 months (n = 30) after termination of the program.	0.7009586690473879
We observed how many of the patients were able to be occupationally re-integrated after completion of phase II rehabilitation.	0.6514117550662116
Here, we present the so-called "Vollmer retractor", which can be fixed on to the operating table.	0.7677689083003963
It allows an optimal transference of the traction force on to the border of the wound, both in upper and lower abdominal interventions.	0.5844144369425094
In this way, as shown by our recent experience, we gain an optimal view of the subdiaphragmatic area and into the small pelvis.	0.7191658129860141
The disaster management in Germany is embodied in the constitution.	0.46702002972015255
According to the German constitution the ministries of the interior of the federal states coordinate the disaster management by delegating it to the city and county administrations.	0.4564510663406531
These elaborate and update a special disaster management calendar, which allows a prompt flow of information to and from the administration and the person in charge of operations and guarantees a smooth collaboration on which the success of the operation depends.	0.622471069824141
The American-European Consensus Conference recently recommended the following criteria for diagnosis of ARDS: (1) acute onset; (2) PaO2/FiO2<=200 mmHg regardless of PEEP level; (3) bilateral infiltrates seen on frontal chest radiograph; (4) PCWP <= 18 mmHg when measured or no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension.	0.5593982032566355
Pathophysiologically, ARDS is characterized by pulmonary edema owing to injury of the capillary-alveolar membranes and increased pulmonary artery pressure.	0.46881357638198623
It is further distinguished by severe hypoxemia unresponsive to the usual methods of support for respiratory failure.	0.41341990099995046
Hypoxemia is caused by intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting due to to persistent perfusion of non-ventilated alveoli.	0.4129539118887678
Another characteristic feature in ARDS is the low thoracopulmonary compliance.	0.4216426362062515
Latest studies suggest that the incidence of the syndrome is in the range of 3-10 cases / 100,000 inhabitants / year.	0.8401347162701669
Mortality rates are a major concern: old and new reports continue to report mortality rates of 50-60%.	0.5312502659777402
Thoracic organ transplantation has evolved as standard therapy in end-stage cardiac and pulmonary failure.	0.508845823744713
Meanwhile more than 50.000 heart, 2500 heart-lung and 10.000 lung transplantations have been performed worldwide.	0.592836966591468
Improvements in patient selection as well as in the postoperative management have led to 1-year survival rates of 70-90%.	0.8428915255817521
Long-term results are still influenced by the development of graft vessels disease, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and malignancies.	0.6340651732203842
Furthermore, indications and results of different procecures will be presented and new developments discussed.	0.6063755767825219
The paper focuses on the cultural history of brain death in Germany in the second half of the 20th century.	0.6404848060644419
It analyzes scientific and public discourses on the relevance of brain death and the importance of medical innovations in intensive care medicine.	0.48131794585880344
The paper examines how the public reacted when heart transplantation led to an urgent need for a new definition of death.	0.5297954406286233
It will be shown how the concept of brain death was accepted by the public, introduced into clinical routine, and implemented through medical and legal policies.	0.6543204455962103
Finally, it will be analyzed why the public consensus on brain death was definitely questioned in the last ten years.	0.7078234226230972
An understanding of the use of the concept of brain death by scientists, lawyers, theologians, and the public during the last three decades may help to shed light on the social role of science in modern and late-modern societies.	0.658293257735353
Background: In the course of Graves' disease (GD) the extraocular muscles become fibrotic after an acute inflammatory stage.	0.6281065987566069
Differentiation of these two stages is important for therapy.	0.7810009712053411
Injuries of the joints of the pelvis and of the acetabulum are still a problem even today.	0.9063586603389757
When the joints of the pelvis are damaged the risk of complicated pelvic injuries, that is to say pelvic injuries with damage to the soft tissues in and around the pelvis, is increased threefold.	0.6888592764421659
The lethality, the overall gravity of the injuries, the probability of haemorrhagic complications and the proportion of associated pelvic injuries are also increased.	0.6706050835299242
Even when anatomical reconstruction of the lower limb girdle is achieved, long-term secondary conditions such as pain and genitourinary and neurological scquelae frequently persist.	0.5835282034943604
Complicated pelvic injuries, i. e. pelvic injury with concomitant damage to organs and soft tissues in the pelvis and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femoral fracture (floating hip) are special cases.	0.6019880242158594
Haemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the treatment of organic lesions must be the first priorities in the interdisciplinary therapy.	0.795134518317162
Even when these priorities are correctly observed, the lethality is almost three times as high as in the case of pelvic injuries not involving soft-tissue damage.	0.5798836749323746
Acetabular fractures are a particular challenge even compared with other joint fractures.	0.4204687979928509
Operative treatment with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has been shown to have the best results.	0.6789514118755826
In addition to the type of fracture and the personal experience of the surgeon concerned, such fracture-specific factors as the presence of further fractures of the posterior wall, comminuted fractures, joint depression fractures and intra-articular fragments increasingly play a part.	0.7479565744499282
The long-term result worsens with increasing number of these additional pathologies.	0.628138455947341
The primary cartilaginous damage caused by the accident seems to have a considerable influence on the long-term result following acetabular fractures.	0.7109256465762449
Two-dimensional conventional X-rays and computer tomographic imaging systems contribute to the diagnosis and surgical planning of patients with orofacial malformations.	0.8068037826038268
The ability to reformat CT scans into three-dimensional osseous and soft tissue surface images has a significant impact on the diagnosis and management of orofacial malformations.	0.5896053001576066
Cephalometric evaluation with teleradiography provides precise insight into both the skeletal structures and the soft parts, enabling the radiologist to assess the relationship among the different parts in a given subject, at any given time and in relation to the normal.	0.6109204948496315
The purpose of this study was to check the precision of the Dräger vaporizer model 19.3 when filled with three different preparations of isoflurane.	0.5367602950759698
Background: Since there is no epidemiologic assessment of the frequency of pain caused by tumor in Germany, tumor-pain-prevalence is estimated indirectly on the basis of mortality and median survival.	0.6411513983395892
Knowing that about 50% of all patients having metastases or incurable locoregional recurrence suffer from pain every day, the product of median survival times mortality was calculated to achieve the number of patients' days with tumor-caused pain per year (82.710.690 days in Germany 1995).	0.6139923974488151
By division with 365 (days), it is calculated that 226.605 patients require tumor pain related treatment at one day in Germany.	0.4679489324432593
Another calculation based on Bonica's publications that 60-90% of patients suffering from advanced cancer are having pain and based on an estimated tumor prevalence 1989/90 revealed a tumor pain prevalence of 221.826.	0.5066841730957892
Laser catheters which run eccentrically on a guide wire were developed for maximization of luminal gain by excimer laser angioplasty (ELCA).	0.3708758883779495
We investigated the safety and efficacy of ELCA with these new catheters plus PTCA in patients with restenoses or occlusions in coronary stents.	0.4643959445899919
The age of standardized instrumented scoliosis correction and stabilization began with Harrington instrumentation (HI).	0.37688130932984737
With HI, satisfactory long-term correction of the frontal plane averaged approximately 50 %, but without notable derotational capabilities.The distraction of the concavity leads to reduction of the sagittal contour of the spine (flat back), which is biomechanically disadvantageous.	0.7002863676776397
The newer multisegmentally attached implant systems avoid this disadvantage.	0.22427430939225107
The first prototypes of these systems were Luque- (SSI) and Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation.	0.672502354578241
Ideal indications for posterior instrumented curve correction are structural idiopathic double major curves and flexible single curves.	0.2913986345706035
However, even with these newer doublerod systems derotation is low, because derotation is, without any doubt, related to anterior release and thus decoupling of the segments by means of disc resection.	0.6483146154020644
Autoaggressive syndromes as causes of diseases underlying chronic blepharitis and keratoconjunctivitis that are refractory to treatment are often difficult to recognize.	0.4138691149160584
The surgical correction of a tandem stenosis of the carotid artery is sometimes difficult, especially if the second stenosis is near or above the skull base.	0.6975643018835156
Angioplasty and Stent implantation may offer an alternative to standard surgical procedures in the treatment of carotid stenoses in the future.	0.6593096164529397
However, the potential advantages of these endovascular techniques warrant continued evaluation.	0.7120263465218651
The application of these techniques in carotid artery tandem stenoses presents specific problems and dangers.	0.5608834736766213
We discuss the case of a 78-year-old man with severe carotid stenoses on both sides and an additional symptomatic tandem stenosis above the skull base on the right side.	0.6588462406199631
After the surgical correction of the left carotid artery using standard endarterectomy, we performed endarterectomy on the right side in combination with an open Stent implantation.	0.8727890536696241
The periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis are also known as Koenen tumors.	0.368883599360622
Joannes Henricus Maria Koenen was born on March 10, 1893, in Eindhoven and died in Bois-le-Duc May 29, 1956.	0.41002872744303814
From 1910 to 1918 he studied medicine at the University of Amsterdam.	0.35273121406722496
Then he worked as a physician at the "Coudewater" asylum in Rosmalen and from 1929 in the "Voorburg" asylum in Vught.	0.4103760723928848
In 1932 he published his publication concerning a family with tuberous sclerosis in which photographs of periungual fibromas are shown.	0.31882600507513764
His thesis in 1933 at the University in Leiden was titled "Imbecility in children.	0.37729330930245064
Its Importance in pedagogic and social regard, by reason of an investigation in some communities in Noord-Brabant".	0.47345588402048233
Later he was appointed director of a state mental institution.	0.31068815728396965
The periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis were first described by Richad Kothe in Munich in 1903.	0.3126450179661684
Parallel with the increasing number of coronary stent implantation procedures, new or more elaborate coronary stents were introduced into clinical use almost every month in 1996.	0.5643647202515389
We have studied the architecture, surface-morphology, and shape-conversion of 16 different coronary stent systems.	0.566039759815801
The objective of our study was to detect possible specific design and surface features which might influence the healing process, instent restenosis, and stent thrombosis.	0.5885956738081153
Using electron microscopy we found ultrasmooth surfaces on 5 stents.	0.2654347401175307
All other coronary stents revealed individually varying and partly sharp-edged surface irregularities.	0.3129412902170578
Video-based morphometry showed covering between 8.3% and 26.4%.	0.6622387850431442
Stent shortening after in-vitro expansion ranged from 0% up to 10.5% of the initial stent length.	0.7954198429479736
In some stent systems balloon dilation lead to over-expansion of the stent margaine.	0.43374382882795387
This over-expansion mounted up to 20% of the balloon diameter and the stents revealed a rather biconcave than homogenous expansion pattern.	0.5252461563142566
This phenomenon was also found after postmortal stent implantation in 20 autopsied hearts.	0.5325797411479102
Unilateral hearing loss (HL) caused by an acoustic neuroma (AN) is regarded to be neural ("non-cochlear").	0.5848223131751503
By using otoacoustic emissions it is possible to prove concurrent sensory (cochlear) HL.	0.45047468325577067
We prefer distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) because these are more frequency-specific and stable.	0.4252767753799805
From April 1994 to May 1996, we examined preoperatively 24 patients with radiologically proven AN.	0.6681388135211435
Pure-tone audiometry, DP-grams, brainstem-evoked response audiometry (BERA) and vestibular studies were performed in all cases, while special auditory tests (Fowler, Carhart) and short increment sensitivity indices were also performed in 12 cases.	0.625307618860118
BERA was pathological in 23 cases and latencies were borderline in one case.	0.44416852496863524
After comparing audiograms and DP-grams we found 13 patients with sensory HL, 4 patients with combined sensorineural HL and 7 patients with neural HL.	0.5894598025101425
There was a strong correlation between the results of DPOAE and the results of special auditory test (=0.63) whereas there was no correlation between tumor size and cochlear function.	0.7089715372849688
The result showed that the typical HL caused by AN was a combined sensorineural loss.	0.655615969473242
DPOAE were not suited for the detection of AN but were able to give exact information about any remaining cochlear function.	0.44128165080885123
The monoclonal dominant malignant T cells in mycosis fungoides (MF) carry identical TCR rearrangements.	0.338329001964688
Their detection is a useful diagnostic tool.	0.5205773402980922
Thus, in routine diagnosis we investigated the occurrence of monoclonal T cells in skin biopsy samples of MF-patients by TCR-PCR, followed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE).	0.560337755605167
In 188 out of 208 MF patients, at least one skin sample with sufficient DNA quality for PCR analysis was obtained.	0.539272987289182
Applying a consensus PCR for the TCR genes VI and J 1/2, we detected monoclonal T cells in 122 cases (65%).	0.5762031853731775
In the remaining 66 cases, we performed two multiplex-PCRs, covering rearrangements of the other TCR genes.	0.7437274413369322
Here we found in 11 cases (6%) predominant clonal rearrangements of VII-IV and J 1/2 and in 2 (1%) those of VI-IV and J P1/2.	0.7789640842174355
In patients with MF, detecting rearrangements of only VI and J 1/2 is sufficient for PCR screening analysis.	0.45413187429888546
In 53 of the patients (28%) the applied methods revealed no monoclonal T cells.	0.7009800195761655
This may be due to a low cell number, oligoclonal nature, chromosomal abberations or remaining of TCR in germline configuration.	0.45218105501664146
Despite significant improvements in early detection of hearing losses in children, a relatively long interval still exists from initial concern by families to definite audiological identification.	0.4814191147766066
The aim of our retrospective cross-sectional study was to identify parental factors contributing to the delay of early detection.	0.7249099442191231
The parents of 70 hearing-impaired children were interviewed.	0.3471935776872502
All children were fitted with hearing aids in our clinical and had no additional physical or cognitive disabilities.	0.5423738582182326
At an average age of 19.5 months, parents or family doctors noticed first signs of a possible hearing impairment.	0.7205067960142207
On average it then took an additional 7.2 months until hearing impairment was diagnosed by an expert and the necessary first steps taken for rehabilitation (fitting of hearing aids).	0.5503268613962892
Significantly, total hearing loss or profound hearing impairments were detected earlier than mild or moderate hearing impairments.	0.41890634158114015
In addition to hearing loss, parental education correlated significantly with an earlier start of rehabilitation.	0.5147390191404505
Statistical analysis revealed that children with hearing-impaired close relatives as well as first-born children tended to be diagnosed later.	0.594800856550564
To further improve secondary prevention of hearing loss, the competence of specific parental groups should be taken into consideration.	0.5723560000213057
After the incidental puncture of a sidebranch of the thyreocervical trunk during a subclavian vein catheterization, a symptomatic av-fistula developped.	0.45811134499816214
The diagnosis was confirmed by angiography.	0.4217634444839152
Using a microcatheter system the fistula was occluded with microcoils.	0.36085306559077535
This prospective study was designed to compare quality of life, life satisfaction, and subjective ratings of health before and at variable time intervals after heart transplantation (HTx).	0.5934150149895909
175 patients were included between February 1994 and December 1997.	0.6045938476909737
Every six months before and 1,5, 3, 6, and 12 months after HTx, they received the following standardized and validated questionnaires: German SF 36, heart failure and specific transplant symptom list, global quality of life assessment, Munich life quality dimension list, expected/experienced life changes after HTx, good command of the German language, and a minimum age of 18 years.	0.7903402489465687
During data evaluation, median (Me), mean (M), and standard deviation (SD) were created from individual parameters.	0.7122656946247599
Quality of life was rated as very poor by 84% of patients with congestive heart failure.	0.6961269483441983
Only 6 weeks after HTx, 74% rated their quality of life as significantly better.	0.5850265475186611
Before HTx 80% were very unsatisfied about their health status and 87% about physical performance.	0.5411703109828094
Six weeks after HTx, this parameter improved significantly and 76% were very satisfied about their health status and 50% about physical performance.	0.6348993374267176
While somatic changes expected before HTx corresponded well with experienced ones, psychological improvements were smaller than expected, but one year after HTx they were significant (before: M=3.66; SD=0.9; Range (R)=3.78 vs 12 months postop: M=4.61; SD=0.6; R=2.67; p<0.05).	0.494611474834009
Quality of life correlated before HTx best with subjectively rated health (r=0.61, p<0.01) and 6 months after with satisfaction about health status (r=0.76, p<0.01).	0.5480914318502572
Only in 25% were expected improvements fulfilled regarding sexual activity/satisfaction, professional situation, and recreational activities.	0.6197944694911776
90% of posttransplant patients reported physical compaints, most by effects of immunsuppression, but were coping well.	0.6968423013941154
The study shows that already 6 weeks after successful HTx all quality of life parameters improved significantly.	0.5758949669828813
Despite some unfulfilled expectations and complaints, the postoperative life situation of HTx patients appeared significantly improved.	0.4858426045997229
Sevoflurane is a "new" volatile inhaled anaesthetic.	0.4921046426125102
Owing to its lower blood-gas solubility coefficient, emergence from anaesthesia is faster with sevoflurane than with isoflurane, enflurane, or halothane.	0.5405489182273601
Sevoflurane undergoes metabolic biodegradation, releasing inorganic fluoride ions that could produce nephrotoxicity.	0.26418469672973305
In this study, we compared serum inorganic fluoride concentrations (IFCs) in patients receiving either sevoflurane or enflurane.	0.7803411172963489
Furthermore, indices of renal function were evaluated until the 3rd postoperative day.	0.4549500052241914
Background: Rarely, an additional Brown's syndrome develops spontaneously in cases of posttraumatic bilateral superior oblique palsy.	0.6129517194745078
Surgical measures are controversial and problematic.	0.27645761569124677
Metastasis formation is a multistep process that requires tumor cells to progress through many different stages.	0.41774115558165986
One of the first steps is a disturbance of the epithelial integrity through a decrease in intercellular homotypic adhesion.	0.7462152334053884
Proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, as well as increased locomotion, leads to intravasation and dissemination of the tumor cells.	0.6044279285702597
In the target organs metastasizing cells adhere to the endothelium, extravasate and form metastases.	0.3759263531162118
Finally, neoangiogenesis is required for the initiation as well as the growth of the metastases, providing the tumor cells with both nutritive agents and growth factors.	0.7322449602083348
This leads to the conclusion that anti-proteolytic and anti-angiogenic substances could provide effective therapeutic approaches for the control of metastatic growth.	0.5391932589087323
Whether or not this goal can be accomplished by synthetic or endogenous drugs must still be demonstrated by basic and definitive clinical research.	0.5010476067115945
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to present our experience and results with arthroscopic resection of the acromioclavicular joint.	0.7015324232746183
Urodynamic examinations were performed in 82 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer before and after radical prostatectomy.	0.6384761850874033
A significant decrease in bladder capacity (396 ml to 331.9 ml), urethral closure pressure (89.6 cm H2O to 65.,2 cm H2O) and functional profile length (61 mm to 25.9 mm) was noted.	0.8091059459182132
The continence rate after radical prostatectomy was 33.4 % after 1 month, 69.4 % after 3 months, 84.7 % after 6 months, and 90.9 % after 12 months, respectively.	0.8657347181270725
A correlation was found between urethral closure pressure and functional profile length and continence.	0.474407590493827
A second urodynamic examination was performed 6 months after radical prostatectomy.	0.5510257651627589
Functional profile length and urethral closure pressure increased.	0.3596747119763182
These data suggest that restoration of continence is based on sphincteric parameters.	0.4513591072739121
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound with biological tissue with regard to cancer therapy.	0.5651752531030204
The physical and biological aspects of this are reviewed and summarized in this paper.	0.7217781793020827
The preliminary results give reason to hope, as ultrasound is easy to focuse and might be applicable as a supplementary therapeutic technique in ultrasound-accessible tumors.	0.5226047479916784
The changes observed in biological studies are clearly a function of the pyhsical parameters.	0.4053936808195064
Therefore, it is possible to calculate and predict the biological effects.	0.7107397460512938
Recent results have shown the potential of magnetic resonance imaging in monitoring ultrasound therapy online.	0.6595647816950785
The capability of MRI to measure temperature will be an important tool for the safe and reliable application of this new therapeutic approach.	0.7532498569852245
The role of ultrasound therapy in the management of human tumors must be clarified in carefully conducted clinical trials.	0.4896254937518214
Posttraumatic deformities after pediatric fractures are either the result of incomplete or failed remodeling, complete or partial stimulation of the growth plates, or complete or partial closure of a growth plate.	0.6438186591058614
In contrast to fractures of the upper extremities, spontaneous remodeling should not be intentionally integrated in the treatment algorithm.	0.8330729605164836
In the context of the quality assurance program of the German pension insurance institutions, instruments and procedures have been developed in the past few years in order to assess the quality of structure, process, and results of inpatient rehabilitation, as well as patient satisfaction.	0.8197770940698037
The routine implementation of these procedures aims at providing rehabilitation hospitals with fast information on shortcomings in their current practice, so that concepts of treatment and - in the long run - effects of rehabilitation can be systematically improved.	0.7259067471359799
When the "quality profiles" of rehabilitation hospitals are compared ("benchmarking"), paying institutions of rehabilitation could gain information on the cost-quality-ratio of particular hospitals as well as important leads for improving the steering processes of patients and hospitals.	0.6678740513392464
In the present article, results of a first "field-run" of the procedures for measuring patient satisfaction and quality of rehabilitation processes are reported.	0.8831044231690159
A comparative analysis of patient satisfaction in four orthopaedic/rheumatologic rehabilitation hospitals showed high degrees of overall satisfaction in all hospitals.	0.4090423729188435
In several subdimensions of patient satisfaction, however, significant differences between hospitals were found.	0.5895471009556077
Quality of rehabilitation processes - as assessed by a standardized peer-review - varied substantially between 36 hospitals.	0.6906456907457973
Problems of quality were found especially in some dimensions that must be considered as crucial for rehabilitation, e.g., in the history and diagnosis of disabilities, in the consideration of psycho-social problems, or in the assessment of occupational capacities.	0.8006469431065015
The analysis of THR-failures showed that the acetabular component still is the main problem of total hip replacement.	0.7389035616483041
The acetabular cup fails more often than the stem.	0.3826498518855702
In the midterm analysis the failure rate is a little bit higher in cementless than in cement fixed cups.	0.5111203904005865
The known effect that the failure rate of cups fixed with cement increases exponentially 8 to 10 years after implantation, could of course not be seen in this study.	0.6491088188538876
The success of the cementless fixation was negatively influenced by the diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis, age over 70 and the fixation manner: the failure rate of threaded cups was higher than the one of pressfit cups although the Zweymüller-cup as well as the Link type V-cup showed good results.	0.6245644962241023
The midterm results of the stem were very good for the cementless as for the cemented technique.	0.5279478741585512
Some implants showed compared to others significantly worse results.	0.32437998043675254
The further implantation should be thought of, what partially has already happened.	0.4075650043370302
The results of cementless stem fixation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthrosis and dysplastic osteoarthritis is comparable, so that cementless fixation should be thought of in case of adequate conditions (ability of partial weight bearing for some weeks, age under 60).	0.5607292784037071
Type I and type II diabetes are the most common types of diabetes.	0.7957868795808443
The ratio of type I to type II diabetes is about 1:9.	0.6300781987155503
Type I diabetes is caused by an absolute insulin deficiency and is therefore referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes.The disease becomes manifest clinically in childhood or adolescence ("juvenile diabetes"), although manifestation in adulthood is being increasingly observed.	0.6408744958234734
Morphologically, a subtotal ( > 80 %) to total loss of beta cells in the pancreatic islets occurs.	0.7973513857404284
Lymphocytic insulitis, which disappears after the beta cells have been totally destroyed, is pathognomonic of type I diabetes.	0.6216190343946029
This insulitis is an expression of an autoimmune event that is triggered by a multitude of factors.	0.4494916357213738
An important factor appears to be a genetic predisposition (HLA DR3/DR4/DQ8) in connection with as yet unknown environmental factors (e. g., viruses).	0.6131007038023757
Autoantibodies, such as islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies (ICA), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and/or autoantibodies to the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid carboxylase (GAD), are already detectable in a prediabetic phase, although it is not possible to predict the time of clinical manifestion.	0.6142727148244538
The course of the disease is dependent on age.	0.9380295213114597
Young children require insulin therapy sooner than juveniles or adults.	0.23999469297932147
This article summarizes data from recent studies on the prevalence, diagnosis and therapy of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children.	0.8845293168380622
The prevalence of this disorder in 4-6 year old children is 0.7%.	0.7997726271692205
Leading clinical sign in 90% of patients is habitual snoring, but this is rather nonspecific, as 60% of patients investigated for habitual snoring do not have OSAS.	0.8869329137327964
Other signs such as daytime sleepiness, failure to thrive, profuse nocturnal sweating or mouth breathing are equally nonspecific.	0.33105193040419656
The diagnosis, therefore, has to be confirmed by polysomnography, where OSAS is suggested by the occurrence of >5 obstructive apneas/hypopneas per hour of sleep in conjunction with a CO2 of >50 mmHg for >8% of sleep time and/or >1 desaturation to <=90%/h.	0.7805843683115914
Patients with progressive cancer and their families face a series of existential crises with each stage of disease up to terminal stages in which palliative treatment is begun, and patients come to accept the inevitability of death.	0.5587288031067997
This can lead to a unique, highly emotional situation with direct or indirect, open or hidden, varied and very personal manifestations.	0.4757677345791125
The dermatological clinic in Homburg was founded in 1945.	0.26130271114381315
In 1947 it was integrated into the Saarland University as a dermatology department.	0.3510243641504706
A review of the history of the clinic documents advances and challenges in clinical dermatology, as well as new developments in related basic research during the last 50 years.	0.6040166984448596
The coexistence of carotid artery stenosis with coronary artery disease occurs in a small percentage of patients requiring open heart surgical procedures.	0.7102193879607791
Whether the combined surgical approach favorably influences the outcome of patients requiring major cardiac operations remains controversial.	0.5337807703525649
We report the successful thrombectomy of the internal carotid artery.	0.5528665515647307
A 33-year-old woman suffered from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after treatment with FSH/HCG for in-vitro fertilization.	0.599544549291115
She developed a transient left hemiparesis.	0.2955956346948697
This was caused by a floating thrombus located in the internal carotid artery.	0.5175947886310769
Open surgical treatment with thrombectomy prevents recurrent neurological symptoms.	0.4219695584036255
The development of hand eczema is a relatively commonly seem dermatosis in housewives.	0.461896266940211
In 1986 we presented a first survey of potential contact dermatitis sources for a housewife.	0.39616068986025577
Now, we present an update in which we analyse the different contact sources in the household and grade them in comparison to the data of 1986.	0.6889990386537536
The results are based on the analysis of a large population of 2633 patients with the occupation "housewife" and the diagnosis "eczema" who have been seen in departments of dermatology belonging to the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK).	0.7334353099209175
Data for HIV infection on transmission probabilities per contact are of widely differing quality.	0.319110258083988
Estimates of infection probabilities after sexual exposures are the most problematic, even though sexual exposure is the most frequent transmission risk.	0.7235936712274875
Extrapolations of data from discordant couple cohort studies and from US seroincidence studies may be seriously biased.	0.31521829131769796
Infectivity of and susceptibility to HIV may be influenced by concomitant STDs, antiretroviral therapy, alloimmunization and/or subinfectious virus exposures and thus may show a wide range of inter- and intraindividual variability.	0.5279121548476283
Differences in factors influencing transmission probability of HIV most likely outweigh differences in sexual behaviour in explaining the differences in epidemic spread of HIV.	0.45274135691694034
Between January 1989 and March 1997, 175 patients with traumatic shoulder dislocations were treated by conservative means (median age 41 years, 39 F, 136 M).	0.6237527720830314
In 78 patients (17 F, 61 M) a clinical and radiological follow up (median 50 months, range 6-106) could be obtained.	0.8726661400565
Additionally, a diagnostic ultrasound was carried out in all patients.	0.8059176661501952
The recurrence rate in the group younger than 30 years (G < 30; n = 35) was 86 %; in the group older than 30 years (G > 30; n = 43) it was 21 % (P < 0.05).	0.8300442545501125
Persisting neurological deficits were found in 6 patients (8 %).	0.6962921037098961
According to the Rowe score, 16 patients (46 %) of the G < 30 achieved excellent or good results, in the G > 30, 29 patients (67 %).	0.8671145443960697
In 17 % of cases, a glenohumeral arthrosis was diagnosed be radiological means.	0.6311954599087687
18 % had radiological signs of a previous fracture of the greater tuberosity.	0.7437970425339002
Hill-Sachs lesions were identified in 19 % of cases.	0.6649595006111259
Rotator cuff tears were diagnosed in 9 % by ultrasound.	0.7335899091431232
No relationship between the duration of immobilization and the recurrence rate was found (P = 0.95).	0.6398666032711509
The recurrence rate following primary shoulder dislocation depends primarily on the patients' age.	0.6021459006041467
We analyzed quality assurance protocol records of 532 geriatric hospital patients in comparison to an administration database concerning data on "length of stay" information (LOS).	0.49092020410766407
Doctors handwritten quality assurance protocol records corresponded in 74.25% of cases to administration data.	0.5976621305740579
14.47% of cases were registered with different LOS; 11.28% of LOS information was missing.	0.7910571879450902
The increasing amount of documentation tasks in German geriatric hospitals is discussed.	0.3536152991353351
Conclusion: We assume that not only discrete well known information (admission and discharge dates, LOS) are contaminated by documentation failure but also data on functional status of geriatric patients which may have important influence on external data processing.	0.6032689222227
The majority of patients with symptomatic spondylolysis can be treated conservatively.	0.7965057001661048
Only when symptoms persist in spite of conservative treatment surgery may be indicated.	0.5091991226270346
In young patients, however, fusion of a mobile segment should be avoided, but a direct repair of the pars defect can be attempted.	0.7473598900079305
This procedure allows complete healing and possibly avoids degeneration of the intervertebral disk.	0.448388301391699
For this purpose Morscher developed the hook screw, which connects the arch with the anterior articular process.	0.5585647438572356
It allows compression of the defect without crossing the defect with the screw.	0.5379589336703802
A follow-up study of the first 33 patients with a follow-up time of 3.5 years on average showed a good subjective result in 79 % of the patients.	0.9974026111624946
In patients younger than 20 years of age, however, the result was good in 87.5 % of cases.	0.7204330802739236
The reason for the better results in young patients is that in older patients the origin of the pain is often not the pars defect, but the degeneration of the intervertebral disk.	0.8662502803291509
Direct repair of spondylolysis is therefore indicated when pain persists after 6 months of conservative treatment or there is a progressive olisthesis of not more than 10 mm.	0.6474516091131244
After the end of growth an MRI study of the intervertebral discs should show whether there is degeneration or not.	0.5888315132303091
Direct repair is indicated only in the absence of disc degeneration.	0.5915306220254773
After the age of 25 years this procedure should not be carried out.	0.6099922630972809
We are presenting a 47-year-old woman who was stung by jellyfish while bathing in the sea of Thailand.	0.46630759854182874
Immediately after the injury she developed sharp pain and urticarial erythema of the skin of the knees accompanied by muscle cramps of the entire body.	0.6491142234075168
After a few days a toxic contact dermatitis with edematous swelling and ulcerations developed, which did not respond to topical antibiotics or corticosteroids.	0.5556872112948942
Three weeks later the patient presented with a disseminated urticarial eruption, which at first responded well to topical treatment and systemic corticosteroids.	0.7192264561247839
Over the next few weeks, however, a relapse of the eruption and the ulcerations occurred.	0.6015020108391526
Raised titres of IgG and IgM antibodies against different jellyfish from the Indian and Pacific Ocean were detected in the patient's serum by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.	0.4921504158025863
Antibodies against bees (class 1) and wasps (class 4) were found by the radioallergosorbent test.	0.7686953436764945
The clinical features and the immunological findings led to the diagnosis of toxic and allergic contact dermatitis to jellyfish venom.	0.6564561677857069
First aid and secondary treatment of jellyfish injuries are suggested.	0.31306046458496867
The design of controlled clinical trials on prevention and therapy of arrhythmic events is a difficult task.	0.5892017888711529

Problems in the specification of indications and in the estimation of the effective sample size cannot be solved by the inclusion of mixed populations but require the establishment of development programs.	0.5849384540782685
Further crucial points are the appropriate choice of control and the identical concomittant treatment and observation of the groups to be compared.	0.5350164415499902
Technical mistakes as imprecise definitions, arbitrary decisions during the course or at termination of a trial, unclear responsibilities or an unscheduled flow of information can be avoided if these potential problems are anticipated in the trial protocol.	0.55588953584154
A prospective approach that anticipates problems at the time the study protocol is drafted is preferable to a reluctant reactive approach during the course of the trial.	0.6078881528533281
Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality after kidney transplantation.	0.4838627727160853
Its general availability and the absence of radiation exposure and discomfort for the patient also make it a suitable procedure for follow-up.	0.5949055847728706
Simple B-mode sonography provides comprehensive information on the morphology of the renal transplant and surrounding structures, while color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) additionally allows assessment of the anastomoses and organ perfusion.	0.5903004487483197
More recent technical advances such as power Doppler ultrasound appear to improve in particular the assessment of peripheral circulation.	0.4372000522341538
The possibilities and limitations of the various sonographic techniques in the evaluation of kidney transplants are discussed with special reference to the most important clinical aspects and some basic technical concepts.	0.7302579792746262
Purpose: The first morphological changes in eyes with HIV infection are microvascular disease of the retina with cotton-wool spots and microaneurysms.	0.6018710102878895
The study was performed to find out if evidence of disturbances of ocular microcirculation can be established by non-invasive methods.	0.8277448791243079
The operative realignment of mechanical axis deviations (MAD) is necessary to prevent early joint degeneration and to reach normal load-bearing.	0.562934672865419
Modern types of external fixation systems allow an alignment of the mechanical axis to exact degrees.	0.46640308229216504
Predominantly this are corrections of angular deformities.	0.24297500549376502
In some cases the analysis of the MAD does not show any angular deformity, but a parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines of a bone.	0.7196679009156186
Such parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines is defined as a translation deformity of the bone.	0.5698635793535956
In combined deformities with angulation and translation the centre of deformity can be established proximal or distal out of the limit of the bone.	0.5637956002919381
In translation deformities the realignment of the mechanical axis requires a parallel re-staggering made by a translation-osteotomy or by a counterangulated double osteotomy.	0.4294797796886546
In complex deformities with angulation and translation, the translation requires a separate corrective planning.	0.4591877447292136
By using external fixator systems to perform acute or progressive corrective osteotomies the position of the Axis of Correction of Angulation (ACA) in relation to the n-CORA of the deformity has to be considered.	0.6405394878083276
If ACA position is not conform with the n-CORA position relevant geometric effects in relation of length and translation occur.	0.4190700102077897
These geometric effects to corrective osteotomies can be calculated by using simple trigonometric formulas or graphical methods.	0.35490673941975903
Possibilities to compensate translation and length effects are shown by using unilateral external fixator systems.	0.4364196528215765
The employers' liability insurance association for victuallers and licensed victuallers has been controlling healing procedures with the aid of a computer program for several years.	0.379801386041122
The personal data of the injured patient and the precise diagnosis of the injury are used to prepare a forecast of the duration of the treatment and of the patient's inability to work.	0.9775991749459875
The basis of this forecast is provided by tables integrated in the program, which have been elaborated by experts on trauma medicine and also constantly refined by them.	0.6650349650658965
Meanwhile numerous insurance companies concerned with accidents and trauma have acquired the program and are intending to use it.	0.35697255033416525
The objective is a national database on trauma medicine covering the whole of Germany.	0.363257961956828
It is intended that its evaluation will help to guarantee the quality of concomitant treatment of trauma victims and also yield some indications on how best to realize the networking of institutions concerned with acute treatment and rehabilitation.	0.4767988840337445
Stroke and its consequences are under medical, sociologic and socioeconomic aspects one of the biggest contemporary challenges.	0.46115887512861065
Due to the demographic development the importance of this disease will further increase.	0.6341450590003236
Nonetheless acute therapy of ischemic stroke up to now was marked by therapeutic nihilism and adherence to empiric therapeutic procedures.	0.48172765876120494
Only the admission of rt-Pa in the USA in 1996 for the systemic thrombolysis in ischemic insults less then 3 hours old led to a change in therapeutic strategies.	0.5709757662618806
The good profit-risk-ratio of early thrombolysis with rt-Pa could be confirmed by further studies lately.	0.5574728438858837
In the meantime this therapy was officially recommended by the AHA in the importance of grade A recommendation.	0.44922114207104097
In Europe thrombolysis is equally promoted as the procedure of choice.	0.4208226819376593
At present only few patients receive such a treatment.	0.41083662933142645
A thrombolytic therapy can only be provided by a minority of centers due to high requirement in infra-structure.	0.4833507152145477
Furthermore clinic admission often appears with immense loss of time.	0.2239509231359239
Unfortunately also within the clinics there are relevant latencies until therapeutic intervention.	0.34741508034065544
Therefore fundamental requirements for thrombolytic therapy are the indentification of potentially suitable patients and the rapid transfer to an appropriate clinic.	0.5409081545294823
A 69-year-old patient with reduced pulmonary function was diagnosed as suffering from non-small cell lung cancer of the left lung invading the main bronchus, pulmonary artery and left atrium.	0.7341905883011333
Using cardiopulmonary bypass, an extended pneumonectomy with partial resection of the left atrium was performed.	0.7227931100386092
The cardiac defect was closed with a pericardial patch.	0.35395538411759253
The lower lobe was divided ex situ from the upper lobe and reimplanted with anastomosis of the lower pulmonary vein to the left auricle.	0.5682925017557385
After a totally uneventful course the patient is in good condition and free of tumor recurrence 2.5 years postoperatively.	0.7798724123098298
In this retrospective study we report the indications, complications and functional and cosmetic results after dermofat grafting into anophthalmic orbits.	0.6577681459853261
The method consists of implantation of autogenous dermis with attached subcutaneous fat from the gluteal region into the orbit.	0.37233764038261563
Twenty-four primary and 4 secondary grafts were implanted in 28 patients aged 12 to 49 years.	0.5042388046927041
In the explantation site one patient showed delayed healing.	0.2960055681362392
All implants became integrated, none were lost because of infection or extrusion.	0.5020984671602177
Eleven patients developed minor complications like central ulceration in the dermis, hair growth on the dermis or suture granuloma.	0.3999755842816595
In the primary implant group the functional and cosmetic outcome was evaluated by measurements of the lid structures, exophthalmometry (Hertel) and measuring the prosthesis motility (Kestenbaum).	0.6188967435126301
Three patients showed fair results; all the others had good or very good results.	0.6232209806788089
In one case of a secondary implant marked graft atrophy was observed.	0.5989634435421315
Despite the more extensive surgery and some minor complications the safety of this method with good functional and cosmetic results makes dermofat grafting an excellent alternative to heterogenous orbital implants.	0.5712985427052
Liver tissue from 14 female patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC; stages I-IV) was systematically investigated for the prevalence and distribution of dendritic antigen-presenting cells.	0.5847390883601723
Dendritic cells (DCs) were immunhistochemically identified by use of anti-S 100 protein and KiMlp antibodies.	0.5537741507487368
We confirm previous findings that, in early PBC, S 100 protein-positive DCs can be detected within the lining of bile duct epithelia.	0.6868483878691952
However, the present study disclosed that S 100 protein- and KiMlp-positive DCs regularly occur in piecemeal necroses (PMNs) developing in PBC-associated chronic hepatitis.	0.6077410408169642
DCs in PMNs were observed in all PBC stages, but were most prominent in late-stage PBC.	0.7058635975662593
These findings suggest that autoimmune tissue damage in PBC may not be limited to bile ducts, but may also ensue in hepatic parenchyma, producing the pattern of chronic hepatitis with signs of activity.	0.5365460249843931
Health care in emergencies is a social good and a hallmark of a humane society, the ethical foundations of which have to form the basis of all decisions regarding medical emergencies.	0.5503962274997188
The ethics of emergency medical care are part of general medical ethics.	0.5506625500594451
Their principles are outlined and put into perspective with regard to dilemmas characteristic of emergency care.	0.3481756199429464
Due to dwindling resources, the efficiency of emergency medical care is being increasingly scrutinized.	0.6563958417006621
Possibilities of rationalizing care without compromising its quality are being discussed, such as renouncing futile therapy and implementing measures of prevention.	0.3901578611008855
If emergency medical services are to accomplish their mission, however, observing standards of medical practice, legal provisions, and the given framework of society, they must not surrender to pure cost containment.	0.587506735295082
We performed a phase II trial with second-line chemotherapy in patients with refractory, metastatic cancer of the bladder.	0.5988431716820223
Second-line therapy consists of 2.6 cycles of mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil and folic acid.	0.708550459700864
Two patients suffered from WHO grade III side effects (nephrotoxicity, leukocytopenia).	0.38209697679261806
We did not find any complete or partial remission.	0.3622764915921778
Four patients had a stable disease; 3.3 months after therapy, patients developed tumor progression with a median survival of 9 months.	0.9347443048938073
Four patients reported an improvement in quality of life.	0.47922857170119376
Since all patients received supportive care, improvement in quality of life cannot be related to chemotherapy alone.	0.6190124040337712
In conclusion, second-line chemotherapy with mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil and folic acid has no effect on refractory, metastatic cancer of the bladder and is no alternative for cisplatin and methotrexate-based chemotherapy.	0.5163597393867455
Every form of active euthanasia is a punishable offence under § 216 of the Penal Code; nor is there any ethical justification for it from a medical point of view.	0.3673408181971263
The many strands of the movement in favour of making "death on demand" exempt from punishment in Germany as it is in The Netherlands cannot change this.	0.5237649787045924
The oral retinoid etretinate (Tigason) has recently been replaced by trans-acitretin (Neotigason) in the treatment of severe psoriasis, primarily because of its short half-life and the assumption that a shorter period of subsequent contraception would be required.	0.6780463748353897
After introduction of the new drug, however, circulating quantities of etretinate were detected in patients treated with trans-acitretin.	0.6135369052839631
Thus far, re-esterification has been detected in at least 83 cases.	0.5538168238520024
The 2-month period of strict contraception initially recommended after oral intake of trans-acitretin has been extended to 2 years, as with etretinate.	0.6367727856438896
We review some aspects of trans-acitretin metabolism, with special emphasis on etretinate formation.	0.5928903048094889
Re-esterification of trans-acitretin into etretinate takes place under varying conditions in volunteers and patients, as well as in animal models.	0.5127541941406536
Ethanol is a co-factor for the enzymatic re-esterification of trans-acitretin.	0.41366213979655875
It is unclear whether the introduction of trans-acitretin has been of any significant benefit to patients.	0.5129674558344129
Monitoring of plasma retinoid levels during and after retinoid therapy remains of decisive importance in managing difficult cases and or in approving decisions for pregnancy.	0.390820616908568
The purpose of this study was to compare the midterm results of the conservative treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures in athletes.	0.5923456373037956
During 1989 and 1990, 279 athletes with ACL ruptures were treated in our Sports Surgery Department, and 221 of them were suitable for inclusion in the study.	0.570196778501169
The patients were divided into two groups based on management after the diagnosis of ACL rupture had been  made.	0.5705478570366387
Group I (n = 129) underwent ACL reconstruction using free bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts, while group II (n = 92) received conservative treatment.	0.6345964178755626
We were able to evaluate 92 patients during follow-up (42 from group I and 50 from group II).	0.5924431251907365
The average follow-up period was 86 months.	0.6832288762909758
There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the patients' age, sex, or level of sports activity.	0.8774519760716809
Follow-up consisted of clinical and radiological examinations and recording of the subjective opinions of the patients.	0.810266038012178
During follow-up, we used IKDC and OAK scores to evaluate the results.	0.6784880394972145
We found significantly better results in the group that was operated on if the patients took part in high-risk pivoting sports, but there was no difference if the patients were in the low-risk or no-risk pivoting group of athletes.	0.9606123857841924
Concerning reoperation and early arthrosis, the difference was significant between the two groups.	0.6960151963606158
Background: By depletion of stratospheric ozone, enhanced levels of UV radiation reach the surface of the earth.	0.4871941523715267
Exposure of the anterior parts of the eye to UV radiation leads to irritation of the conjunctival and corneal cells.	0.610200483511181
The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of a low field strength MRI unit (0.2 T; Esaote, Biomedica) and a high field strength MRI unit (1.5 T; Siemens) in detecting meniscal lesions.	0.7983501551676568
Twenty patients were investigated on a 0.2-T low-field MRI unit and a 1.5-T high-field MRI unit for meniscal lesions.	0.8455203680986653
Evaluation was performed of four meniscal compartments (anterior and posterior medial and lateral meniscus), for a total of 80 observations.	0.6769028266595062
The reliability of diagnosis was ranked qualitatively on a three-point scale.	0.5159727022147954
Investigations of the high-field MRI unit revealed a meniscal tear in 6 patients and ruled out a tear in 14 patients.	0.6847900556790397
Evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 58 observations and with moderate confidence in 22 observations.	0.3765392594036418
Investigations of the low-field MRI unit revealed a meniscal tear in 5 patients and ruled out tears in 15 patients.	0.6321594551137013
Evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 39 observations, with moderate confidence in 38 observations, and with low confidence in 3 observations.	0.6361450954637557
The diagnosis in high- and low-field images was identical in 98.7 % of cases; in one patient observations from the high-field unit changed the therapeutic management.	0.9715284462334847
Diagnostic reliability was significantly higher with highfield strength MR imaging.	0.44771697624435575
Low field strength MR imaging shows comparatively high diagnostic accuracy for meniscal lesions compared to high field strength imaging; however, we demonstrated a significantly higher confidence in diagnosis with high-field MR imaging.	0.704907458250558
The past decade has seen the successful application of genetic techniques in the dissection of the most important phenotypes of cancer cells.	0.6586729187295274
In the case of drug resistance mechanisms, the elucidation of the genes involved in resistance to anticancer agents has led to new and unexpected information about tumor physiology and may well open therapeutic options by virtue of reversing clinical chemoresistance.	0.4888264833852514
The experimental characterization of defined multidrug resistance factors, such as P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance associated protein, topoisomerase, or glutathione-S-transferase in urologic malignancies, is now relatively comprehensive, allowing for an initial analysis.	0.5157393229825075
Clinical studies on some of these concepts have been started and will be the subject of careful scrutinity.	0.6356540633233285
We expect that they will have a considerable impact on the way certain urologic anticancer strategies will be pursued in the future.	0.4696458255924107
A study was carried out to determine the risk of dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar and of the lingual nerve after molar surgery.	0.6707697967903189
A total of 1103 impacted lower wisdom teeth and 3 impacted lower second molars were removed in 687 patients, all of whom with unaltered sensibility preoperatively.	0.45831621027986286
Clinical, radiological, and surgical factors of each case were recorded.	0.7080464943746649
Postoperative disturbances in the sensibility of the lip and tongue were evaluated by neurological examination.	0.4885821022415579
Follow-up was carried out for a maximum of 35 weeks.	0.7388466352395885
Dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve occurred with an incidence of 3.57%.	0.5362620414908658
The lingual nerve was injured in 2.1% of patients.	0.6881207531270742
Most of the initially reported alterations in sensation resolved within the follow-up period.	0.5219337613869112
Dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve persisted in 0.91%, and of the lingual nerve in 0.37%.	0.6509613300344486
However, the extent of the prolonged impairment was slight in general.	0.5798714149739419
The effect of the documented factors on the incidence of dysesthesia was analyzed.	0.5503257406241037
For the inferior alveolar nerve, analysis revealed significant effects in older patients, for completely developed roots, for deeply impacted teeth, in the radiological relationship of the roots and the inferior alveolar canal, for difficult surgery, and for intraoperative exposure of the nerve.	0.8196020280116417
The surgeon and the anesthesia had a significant influence on lingual dysesthesia.	0.5231312456313105
Background: This review of radiological and other procedures used in the diagnosis of (chronic) low-back pain is not intended to provide a complete evaluation of the methods employed, because the validity, specificity and sensitivity of the various diagnostic measures are the subject of so much controversy that a comprehensive discussion would be beyond the scope of the present overview.	0.8605230043826202
The choice of method depends not only on the clinical symptoms but also on the localisation of the pain, the aetiology of which may also be related to the age of the patient.	0.8444598745301912
Enteritis and pseudoappendicitis are typical manifestations of Yersinia infections in children.	0.2989103489130432
This is a report on a child with localised tumourous mesenteric lymphadenitis due to Yersinia enterocolitica persistent for a long time.	0.5327827803345854
We found specific antibodies against Yersinia outer membrane proteins repeat-edly in the patients' serum.	0.5751084683975608
Only after a ciprofloxacin therapy for 16 weeks we observed a recovery of our patient.	0.47654689709336967
The present study investigates patients' expectations toward radiotherapy and their associations to quality of life and physician judgements.	0.6474730301017517
Fifty-five patients with tumors of different sites (30 with previous tumor-related surgery, 25 without surgery) admitted to the department of radiotherapy filled out a standardized questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30, PLC by Siegrist et al., therapy-related expectations and success) before and after inpatient radiotherapy.	0.6639934101805322
The corresponding physician ratings were collected.	0.2120960165675338
Fifty-eight percent of the patients expected the therapeutic goal "healing", whereas from the physician's standpoint this was realistic in only 7 % of cases.	0.7251232745758188
The specific radiotherapy-related expectations "tumor control" and "pain relief" reached almost the same levels in patients and physician (71 % vs 71 % and 40 % vs 44 %).	0.829470627635613
Patients with healing expectancy reported higher quality of life at the beginning of the therapy (53.4 % vs 39.9 %); patients expecting pain relief reported lower quality of life (37.1 % vs 54.5 %).	0.735030913509787
Surgical patients who had been operated on within the past year (n = 18) showed a particularly high healing expectancy (83 %), whereas patients whose operation dated back more than 1 year focused on pain relief as therapeutic goal (83 %).	0.6844107729743454
The surgeon, as the primary contact person for patients, can influence patients' therapy-related expectations.	0.8002207408360771
In explaining the overall therapeutic strategy, surgeons should also mention the scope and limits of adjuvant therapies.	0.44028054513188364
The meanings of the terms "quality", "quality of care", and "quality management" were clarified with common international definitions.	0.8563400967144178
Based on that, the basic ideas, concepts, and objectives of quality management in medicine were explained.	0.7109234491120403
Finally some future trends related to quality were viewed, which represent challenges for the medical profession and entire medicine.	0.5839954881350424
The papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome (PPGSS) was first described in 1990 by Harms et al.	0.4202103615438175
The syndrome is characterised by fever, an itchy erythema with edema, confluent papules and purpura of the hands and feet in a "gloves and socks" distribution.	0.5143719250904603
The skin lesions may be associated with purpura and superficial erosions of the oral mucosa.	0.6850152852821081
Viral infections, in particular parvovirus B19, are the most likely trigger.	0.986806686523725
In the present case PPGSS developed after taking trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.	0.6046228880471648
Since the patient developed identical symptoms after accidental re-challenge with the same drug, this case strongly suggests medications as another factor in the pathogenesis of PPGSS.	0.6432453209878014
Most fractures of the clavicle heal well with nonoperative treatment.	0.5198861802880917
On rare occasions, malunited clavicular fractures are associated with a pattern of disability that includes not only pain but also functional or neurovascular impairment.	0.4365601339088784
In these cases, clavicular osteotomy and correction of the deformity should be considered.	0.6159924600823041
In four patients with a malunited fracture of the clavicle following nonoperative treatment, we performed a clavicular osteotomy for deformity.	0.8264366833561488
In all four patients the clavicular fracture healed with shortening associated with pain and ipsilateral glenohumeral dysfunction.	0.48313299790983966
The deformity was not associated with neurovascular dysfunction.	0.3526476242121302
In preoperative X-ray studies, the shortening of the malunited clavicle was between 0.9 and 2.2 cm in comparison to the contralateral clavicle.	0.9074408782131104
All patients underwent an extension osteotomy of the clavicle with interposition of an autogenous iliac crest bone graft.	0.5945140570204369
The follow-up was 1 - 4 years postoperatively.	0.8851373413788347
The functional outcome was evaluated using the Constant-Murley and the UCLA score.	0.5597047579921649
All patients had immediate pain relief following osteotomy and correction of the deformity.	0.6201965496077156
The shoulder function rapidly improved, and the functional outcome was good in three out of the four patients.	0.835463439495535
If there is associated functional impairment in malunited clavicular fractures, extension osteotomy combined with autogenous bone grafting may produce predictably good results.	0.45299972279527895
As the importance of laparoscopic surgery for benign diseases of the gastrointestinal tract continues to grow, the application of this approach in cases of malignancy remains controversial.	0.6090533406946536
Although the concept of cancer recurrence in the area of surgical wounds is not new, the incidence of port site recurrence is the most obvious concern.	0.745943333178692
Indications and contraindications for surgery as well as a standardized nomenclature describing the type of laparoscopic procedures being performed are some other issues that need to be clarified.	0.5655925194803063
Complete laparoscopic procedures or the combination of laparoscopy with open techniques can offer advantages and disadvantages that surgeons will have to take into consideration when making decisions.	0.5212260518329578

In the biopsy material of a polypoid intrabronchial lesion of a 54-year-old male patient with radiologically established lung tumor, spindle-cell neoplasia was seen.	0.4946855924552843
No clear histogenetic classification of the submucous tumor process was possible.	0.459233000316231
After resection of the right upper lobe of the lung, including the results of additional immunohistochemical analyses, the tumor was classified as biphasic synovial sarcoma.	0.8549716592632282
This was suggested mostly by immunohistochemical detection of the epithelial membrane antigene (EMA) and of vimentin.	0.6682353542707394
Extensive clinical examinations ruled out the possibility of a primary tumor with extrapulmonary localization.	0.6167598438600904
This case report shows the problems faced in correctly classifying the histogenesis or the direction of differentiation in extremely rare cases of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma.	0.5772162060106939
Especially in small biopsy samples showing a submucous spindle-cell tumor of the lung, apart from frequent sarcoma metastases, the presence of primary synovial sarcoma of the lung has to be considered in the differential diagnosis.	0.663100057013919
Necrotizing pancreatitis is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.	0.4812438698927774
Formerly, surgical treatment with early and extensive pancreatic resection has been the standard.	0.8068737968669265
Improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and progress in the field of intensive care therapy have made conservative therapy the initial standard in the treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis.	0.7585063798384077
A considerable percentage of patients with sterile necrosis can be managed with low morbidity and mortality by conservative treatment without operation.	0.7711272448258513
Nevertheless, surgical treatment is indicated in patients with infected necrosis and in sterile necrosis if multiorgan failure persists over a limited period of time despite maximum intensive care therapy.	0.702995824559761
Pancreatic resection should be abandoned for surgical treatment of pancreatic necrosis, as results with regard to morbidity, mortality and long-term outcome are unsatisfactory.	0.7911268255574984
Today the surgical standard is careful digital necrosectomy, which must be followed by either postoperatve drainage, repeated open lavage or continuous closed lavage.	0.5059208339033706

The hospital staff should closely cooperate with the doctors in private practice who admit patients and should continously support patient organizations.	0.41491250896815135
The quality of outcome is influenced by the process quality which depends on the following factors: selection, training and motivation of the hospital staff; supervision of clinical assessment and documentation by senior physicians, daily x-ray demonstrations and case reports, interdisciplinary case demonstrations at least every week in addition to daily consultation, team reports, regular education including review of actual literature for physicians, education programs exchanging knowledge with physiotherapists and nurses, and regular education programs for patients.	0.6021933996243453
Process quality can only be achieved by an interdisciplinary approach and regular communication between all participants including the patient, whose opinion must be noted and regarded.	0.5952753593373319
As far as possible, the same doctor who treats the patient in the hospital should follow her/him in the outpatient clinic.	0.708248976244819
The quality of outcome can be improved by regular reinvestigation of the patient with control of medication, side effects, efficacy, documentation of clinical, biochemical, radiological, and functional data.	0.7485443406103199

At present, phosphodiesterase III inhibitors are commonly used for the treatment of low cardiac output states.	0.6173909171976829
Despite their positive inotropic and lusitropic effects, these drugs are still under discussion because of certain adverse effects like thrombopaenia, elevation of transaminases, abdominal disregulation, and excessive periphereal vasodilatation.	0.5575847108010796
As a consequence, more cardioselective phosphodiesterase inhibitors were developed with the aim of reducing these adverse effects.	0.6218912208440146
One of them, enoximone (Marion Merrell Dow, Fig.	0.3701158319781021

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of IP on skeletal muscle function after 3 h ischemia and 2 h reperfusion in a rodent model.	0.5493128382736919
IP protocols using one, two, or three preconditioning cycles of 10 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion each, were compared to non-preconditioned controls.	0.6813046388002422
IP was found to significantly improve force, performance, endurance, and contractility of postischemic skeletal muscle.	0.6122848428537361
The efficacy of IP- induced protection was correlated with the number of preconditioning cycles.	0.47371566825542905
Preconditioning with three cycles resulted in a more effective protection as compared to one or two cycles.	0.7036314439031436

The isochromosome i(12p) represents the most common and characteristic cytogenetic finding which already appears in testicular carcinoma in situ.	0.4850315253664422
A number of proto - oncogenes (Cyclin D and PTHLH) as well as putative tumor suppressor genes are localized on 12p; however, their role in pathogenesis and prognosis of testicular germ cell tumors has not been defined yet.	0.5693043580645933
Clinical characteristics of patients with familial testicular germ cell tumors indicate a genetic background for the development of testicular tumors.	0.5251780797068408
Although a number of chromsomal loci encoding potential testicular tumor susceptibility genes have been identified, the genetic basis of testicular cancer pathogenesis is still unknown.	0.5416738958889188
With regard to molecular prognostic risk factors most of the reported data on proliferation markers, tumor suppressor genes, proteases and adhesion molecules have to be confirmed in prospective randomized trials prior to their widespread clinical use.	0.6268893934437556
Based on the available data on prospective studies percentage of embryonal carcinoma and vascular invasion appear to be the most significant prognosticators.	0.760231136568091
Investigation and identification of those factors determining the aggressive biologic behavior of embryonal carcinoma compared to all other histological components appear to be most promising in research for prognosticators of metastatic disease.	0.48042129541357453
After laparoscopic cholecystectomy, carbon dioxide (CO2) must be exhaled after resorption from the abdominal cavity.	0.41459803811671275
There is controversy about the amount and relevance of postoperative CO2 resorption.	0.4627352941885458
Without continuous postoperative monitoring, after laparoscopic cholecystectomy a certain risk may consist in unnoticed hypercapnia due to CO2 resorption.	0.4526763272949413
Studies exist on the course of end-expiratory CO2 (PeCO2) alone over a longer postoperative period of time in extubated patients during spontaneous breathing.	0.5708661404236478
The goal of this prospective study was to investigate the amount of CO2 resorbed from the abdominal cavity in the postoperative period by means of CO2 metabolism.	0.701174295101753
After giving informed consent to the study, which was approved by the local ethics committee, 20 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	0.8327344168682188
All patients received general endotracheal anaesthesia.	0.44339291913297574
After induction, total IV anaesthesia was maintained using fentanyl, propofol, and atracurium.	0.623208962109224
Patients were ventilated with oxygen in air (FiO2 0.4).	0.5289634484060535
The intraabdominal pressure during the surgical procedure ranged from 12 to 14 mm Hg.	0.4895943247282025
Thirty minutes after releasing the capnoperitoneum (KP), CO2 elimination (V.CO2), oxygen uptake (V.O2), and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured every minute for 1 h by indirect calorimetry using the metabolic monitor Deltatrac according to the principle of Canopy.	0.6244999913311262
Assuming an unchanged metabolism, the CO2 resorption (V.CO2) at any given time (t) can be calculated from V.CO2 (t)=V.CO2 (t)-RQ (preop) V.O2 (t).	0.7792006997634006
It was thus necessary to define the patient's metabolism on the day of operation.	0.6930555099586102
The first data were collected before surgery and after introduction of the arterial and venous cannulae for a 15-min period.	0.694541004663877
Measuring point 0 was determined after exsufflation of the KP and emptying of the remaining CO2 via manual compression by the surgeon at the end of surgery.	0.5230471757936089
Patient's tracheas were extubated and metabolic monitoring started 30 min after release of the KP for 60 min.	0.4733188659190974
Simultaneously, a nasal side-stream capnometry probe was placed and the PeCO2 and respiratory frequency (RF) were obtained by the Capnomac Ultima (Datex) and registered every minute as well.	0.6079186888452558
Values were averaged over four periods of 15 min each.	0.35322879226863085

Postoperative pain was scored by a visual analog scale and completed by a subjective index questionnaire on general well-being.	0.47469044047185455
All data were analysed by the Friedman or Wilcoxon test; P<0.05 was considered significant.	0.47593478733531974
The findings do not indicate CO2 resorption in the postoperative period after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Tables 2 and 3, Fig.	0.6686850072470351
Arterial CO2 as well as PeCO2 were elevated postoperatively (45 mm Hg vs. 36 mm Hg intraoperatively), while V.CO2 and V.O2 were unchanged when compared to the preoperative measuring period.	0.654345363658675
The postoperative RF was comparable to preoperative values.	0.41272632412133475
Calculated CO2 was lower than 10 ml/min and within accuracy of measurements.	0.7227023549674296
The postoperative pain index ranged between 3 and 4, and 3.75 - 15 mg piritramid was administered.	0.835088474088484
All patients feld tired immediately after the operation, but scores improved slightly at the end of the 60-min period of metabolic monitoring.	0.583517238561175
There is no significant resorption of CO2 from the abdominal cavity later than 30 min after releasing the KP.	0.6165499524934102
Up to this time, any CO2 remaining in the abdominal cavity after careful emptying by the surgeon has been resorbed and exhaled.	0.5648194461214079
The gene of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)-inhibitor p16INK4A (CDKN2/MTS1) has been proposed as a candidate for a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 9p21, a frequently deleted region in a series of human cancers including malignant melanoma.	0.5691983805323367
An increasing and sometimes conflicting body of data has accumulated regarding the frequency of homozygous deletions and mutations as well as the importance of p16INK4A in malignant melanoma.	0.4717158415559701
The purpose of this review is therefore to summarize the current knowledge on p16INK4A and to discuss its biologic significance in the pathogenesis of melanocytic tumors.	0.6967911446891163
The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in HIV-infected patients is high.	0.6151607048893993
The differential diagnosis includes psychoreactive disorders, acute psychiatric symptoms of an HIV-associated encephalopathy, and symptomatic psychotic illnesses due to secondary neurologic manifestations such as opportunistic central nervous infections and intracerebral lymphoma.	0.5959055553362989
Clinical aspects and psychopathological findings are not sufficient for differential diagnosis and identification of primarily psychiatric disorders.	0.6142177347972475
Secondary neurologic manifestations causing a symptomatic psychosis must be excluded as soon as possible by brain imaging (CT, MRI) and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid.	0.7292395077264633
In emergency situations, however, German law imposes strict regulations, especially in the case of sectioned patients.	0.5546557997175396
These medical and medicolegal questions are illustrated by case reports and propositions for an effective strategy are made.	0.4575758467172227
In simultaneous bilateral nerve recordings, patients with Sympathetically Maintained Pain (SMP) affecting one limb show similar sympathetic traffic in nerves supplying the affected and unaffected limb, also when the painful limb shows a marked regional autonomic (vasomotor) dysfunction.	0.45898374419485677
These findings argue against the notion that SMP must be mediated by a reflex change in the pattern of sympathetic discharge.	0.4511651556420647
In general, they underline the fact that autonomic effector disturbances may give little information about underlying nerve traffic.	0.4705513830015226
Intraoperative transluminal angioplasty (ITA) has considerably broadened the spectrum of vascular surgical reconstruction, fulfils the requirements of minimally invasive therapy and has thus experienced a rapid development within the past few years.	0.5823467532227092
Whereas the indications and clinical results have been described adequately in the literature, reports on the procedural management of ITA are rare.	0.7411781322071914
One of the basic prerequisites of this method is the correct and nontraumatic implantation of the vascular access sheath at the proper location.	0.7926429980736386
In the following, the technique of ortho- and retrograde sheath implantation, either through the vessel itself or through a vascular graft, is described in detail.	0.8021316384984413
By respecting particular standards for sheath introduction, ischaemia time and vessel wall injury during ITA can be kept to a minimum.	0.34816148001099845
The importance of the chronology of vascular reconstruction to angioplasty is also elucidated.	0.5055596617162926
In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of sheath implantation compared with direct vessel puncture are demonstrated.	0.5271100236906939
In spite of new developments, including intraluminal fixation of the sheath with an expandable balloon, the "ideal" angioplasty access sheath is, as yet, not available.	0.7071388136520946
In several cases of lupus erythematosus (SLE, SCLE, DLE), the Koebner phenomenon could be seen in the apparently normal skin of patients following traumas, scratching effects, operation scars, contact dermatitis, pressure from sock tops, application of liquid nitrogen, exposure to strong sun light, etc.	0.5215788652231409
The interval between exposure to such provocation factors and appearance of the isomorphic reactions varied from case to case.	0.4573862313426016
In SLE patients receiving systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids, the Koebner phenomenon could not be found, while it was detected in patients with generalized DLE who had never received any systemic glucocorticoid hormones.	0.7003873774187095
It was not seen in patients with localized DLE.	0.631978049522946
There was no direct relationship between the appearance of humoral autoantibodies and onset of the Koebner phenomenon.	0.6251208680029754
With regard to the histopathogenesis of the Koebner phenomenon, it is thought that disturbances of the local cellular repair processes and of the cytokine network, with expression of adhesion molecules, might be involved.	0.6707868324742093
The Koebner phenomenon may be a valuable model for the investigation of lupus erythematosus.	0.6578755924517224

We represent and discuss etiology, diagnosis as well as differential diagnoses of tuberculous orchtitis referring to an actual case of this rare disease.	0.5729734562856876
In the least of all cases one can conclude from the clinical symptoms on the tuberculous origin of the disease.	0.6914555744852608
Other differential diagnoses will set more frequently due to rarity of this disease.	0.39004379316628046
Quite a lot of cases a bacterial superinfection veils the sterile leucocyturia as main characteristic of genitourinary tuberculosis.	0.36897225834965963
Imaging diagnostics frequently fails to give indications of tuberculous origin of the lesion.	0.45723644302429356
As before the evidence of Mycobacteria tuberculosis is the most important parameter to proof a tuberculosis.	0.620959941165127
Despite required microbiological cultivation to make a resistogram the polymerase chain reaction is a high sensitive and comparable fast method for detection of Mycobacteria even from tissue.	0.5187255462711765
In such dubious cases we recommend to perform an operative denudation due to frequently difficult delimitation from malignant testicular tumours.	0.4030954046990259
In surgical procedures associated with high blood loss, such as vascular and cardiac operations, differential diagnosis and therapy of perioperative hemorrhage are of special importance.	0.6616227394690422
Preoperative screening for patients at high risk of bleeding and in particular for those with qualitative platelet disorders [drug-induced platelet disorders (in particular ASS), von Willebrand's disease and other congenital platelet disorders] is effective in minimizing blood loss.	0.7317471454416038
Bleeding in acute medical emergencies or during emergency operations may require treatment without specific investigations being performed in advance.	0.3738908202881269
Therefore, simple schemes are essential for the rapid management of acute hemostatic problems.	0.6573569267816786
The aim of this paper was to address the diagnostic and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis focusing mainly on diagnosis and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis due to blood platelet disorders and blood coagulation disorders and preoperative identification of patients at increased risk of bleeding.	0.7095207670625894
Although deep vein thrombosis now has a better prognosis than in the era before anticoagulation, a number of patients remain in whom ulcus cruris cannot be adequately controlled by conservative treatment.	0.6130678872600466
The case report of a 50-year-old woman with stage III chronic venous insufficiency associated with the post-thrombotic syndrome is presented.	0.6857590078887142
Progress in imaging techniques and functional diagnostics of the post-thrombotic syndrome make a reliable differentiation of the chronic venous insufficiency possible with respect to obstruction or reflux.	0.5876602255496609
If conservative treatment fails, autological valve transplantation is described as a suitable reconstructive management method in the treatment of reflux.	0.4841903946463037
Following this report, the results and limitations of this method are discussed.	0.9616180621195343
The neurobiological alterations commonly found in affective disorders (e.g., alterations in the nocturnal sleep profile, dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system) gradually recover with improvement of the depressive syndrome.	0.4503281552928893
Their persistence during full clinical remission, however, is associated with an increased risk for relapse and, thus may represent trait markers for affective disorders.	0.616144983967593
In order to test this hypothesis, we designed a prospective study in which healthy first-degree relatives (high-risk probands; HRPs; n=54) of patients with an affective disorder are investigated by means of polysomnography, the combined dexamethasone and corticotropine-releasing hormone (DEX-CRH) test and a variety of psychometric scales.	0.6858429988349595
In the present part of the study (index assessment), these HRPs, as a group, showed depressionlike alterations in both the sleep pattern and the DEX-CRH-test outcome; furthermore, their psychometric profile was characterized by elevated scores on the scales assessing "rigidity" and "autonomic lability".	0.7389841151403992
On a single-case level, 35% of the HRPs were identified as conspicuous (depressionlike) in at least two of the three areas investigated.	0.7953481901962649
A decision of whether or not this "conspicuousness" indeed represents a trait marker for affective disorders can be reached when the follow-up part of the study has identified those HRPs with their respective premorbide status who have developed an affective disorder in the meantime.	0.6107812590913324
Undifferentiated connective tissue disease with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed in a 33 year old woman after recurrent arterial thromboses, two miscarriages and myocarditis.	0.5802075227220532
Despite effective immunosuppression and anticoagulation her initially mild precapillary pulmonary hypertension progressed in the absence of thromboembolic events, cardiopulmonary disease or other systemic disorders.	0.42434005240728395
iloprost in a dosage of up to 4.5 ng/kg/min for a total of 15 months, her 6 min walking-distance improved from 210 to 315 m, the pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 1710 to 1111 dynxsxcm-5 and the mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased from 64 to 54 mmHg.	0.6015276557335034
This partial success of conservative treatment enabled a reassessment of the necessity for heart and lung transplantation.	0.4663650627942572
In the USA, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been approved for therapy of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) within a 3 hour time window based on the results of the NINDS [1] trial.	0.6525843782266282
Only few patients with AIS are referred to a hospital within three hours after onset of symptoms, and only 3% of these patients qualify for treatment with rt-PA.	0.8187860852395166
Therefore, only few patients with AIS will potentially benefit from therapy with rt-PA if NINDS criteria are applied.	0.580899827891025
The goal of the Second European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study (ECASS II) was to evaluate safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in AIS for a 6 hour time window.	0.7153472563634011
Objective: To prove the response and side effects of sulphasalazine in early and late onset juvenile pauciarthritis, also the therapeutic effect dependent on the marker HLA B27.	0.7252900140832037
The radiologic imaging methods play an important role in the precise staging as basic requirement for an effective concept of tumor therapy.	0.5075947700355279
The accuracy of ultrasound in the primary staging according to the TNM-classification (UICC) was therefore prospectively investigated in 260 patients with head and neck tumors of the clinical stages T1N0 to T4N3.	0.7510859568107958
The clinically (C1) and sonographically (C2) evaluated pretherapeutic stages were compared to the postoperative histopathologic tumor classifications.	0.5926122084428199
The clinical staging was correct in 75.0 %, high in 7.7 %, low in 17.3 %, the N-stages were correct in 59.2 %, high in 17.7 %, low in 23.1 %.	0.7619944519252622
The sonographic staging was apparently superior with the T-classifications correct in 92.3 %, high in 7.7 %, low 0.0 %.	0.6342284974727493
The N-stages were correct in 89.6 %, high in 9.2 %, low in 1.2 %.	0.7123146749546692
The accuracy of combined TN classification rose from clinical 46.5 % to 84.6 % by sonography.	0.7249489276201717
Accompanying inflammations, foregoing biopsies and tooth extractions were the main reasons for incorrect staging.	0.4034993989320991
Therefore, the thorough sonographic investigation performed after the clinical examination and before invasive procedures, due to little patient discomfort, good availability and high accuracy, is an excellent sectional imaging method for staging, therapy-planning and follow up of tumors of the head and neck especially of the orofacial regions.	0.7295487298324885
Standardized guidelines for exercise training for patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) have not been established.	0.7089405389628661
In the past CHF patients involved in exercise training studies demonstrated a wide range of cardiac and functional impairment, with an ejection fraction between 18 and 35% and a peak VO2 between 12.2 and 25.4 ml/kg/min on average.	0.8122098689013987
For determination of training intensity, a VO2 between 40 and 70% of peak VO2 and/or training heart rate between 60 and 80% of peak heart rate was used.	0.7104283595517767
There was also a wide range for frequency (between 3 and 7 times per week) and duration of training (between 20 and 60 min per session).	0.7540786862445064
For aerobic exercise training only continuous training methods were applied.	0.32361985458086795
We have developed a new interval training method which allows intense exercise stimuli on peripheral muscles with minimal cardiac strain.	0.4006306327674591
After only three weeks of training, the improvement in aerobic capacity was similar to that reported after longer training periods using continuous methods.	0.575876324243314
To determine work rate for work phases of interval training, a special steep ramp test was developed.	0.46096373149934405
By analysis of acute physical responses to this testing procedure and to the interval training, both were proven to be tolerable in CHF patients, even if their ejection fraction is as low as 13%, or peak cardiac index not greater than 1.6 l/m2/min, and peak VO2 less than 8.5 ml/kg/min.	0.761002865992181
Therapeutic choice in laryngeal carcinoma is influenced by the nature of the tumor and a variety of factors involving the patient and physician.	0.7141651285264651
Small (T1) and exophytic (T1, T2) tumors are suitable for radiotherapy.	0.5544971866171158
Limited lesions (T1, T2) can be cured by functional endoscopic resection techniques or external partial laryngectomies.	0.4278848913468054
Extensive tumors (large T2; T3) are treated by total laryngectomy or by primary irradiation, especially in the case of a good response to induction chemotherapy.	0.6954622233981711
When radiation treatment fails, surgery succeeds in more than half of the cases.	0.5288923617770785
Tumors infiltrating or transgressing the laryngeal framework (T4) can only be cured by total laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy.	0.4792577064603973
Subtotal or circular ablation of the adjacent pharynx or esophagectomy needs repair with visceral or myocutaneous grafts.	0.37682781897231354
Lymphatics are preferentially treated with the same modality as used in the primary disease.	0.8051359037669663
Inconspicuous lymphatics should be treated electively in most cases, with the exception of early glottic cancer.	0.6366607499310827
Induced hypotension is defined as a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure to 50-60 mm Hg in normotensive subjects.	0.7395613602677945
The aim of induced hypotension is to decrease intraoperative blood loss, decrease the need for blood transfusions and improve operating conditions.	0.65950150817776
Most studies indicate that induced hypotension can decrease intraoperative blood loss by 50% in many surgical procedures; however, some studies report that blood loss is not significantly reduced.	0.664829842856521
Current methods of induced hypotension are based on the use of rapid and short-acting vasodilators as primary agents (nitroprusside, nitroglycerine, urapidil), supplemented by volatile anesthetics (isoflurane) and/or -blockers (esmolol) to improve effect, reduce dosage and prevent side effects (reflex tachycardia, tachyphylaxis, rebound hypertension).	0.5861319622276449
Proper positioning of the patient and controlled ventilation aid in reducing blood loss.	0.7135404090016416
Major risks of induced hypotension are a reduction in blood flow (i.e.	0.6086041897207453
ischaemia) of vital organs (brain, myocardium) and elevation of intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients.	0.7564371678710637
Thus, major contraindications of induced hypotension are severe coronary artery disease, hypertension combined with arteriosclerosis of cerebral vessels and increased intracranial pressure in patients with cerebral disease.	0.6460748547982176
Complications are rare in otherwise healthy patients, but may be higher in elderly patients and those with underlying organ dysfunction.	0.8457689856969258
Therefore, careful assessment and selection of patients, together with consideration of the potential complications, appropriate choice of drugs and invasive beatby-beat monitoring, are essential for the safe practice of induced hypotension.	0.6645977359134223
Abstract  Empirical results stemming from infant research have contributed extensively to the understanding of coping with psychosocial stress and vulnerability for psychosomatic symptoms in later life.	0.4091563161734543
The interaction and the emotional exchange between caregiver and child in the first months of life lead to representations of interactions that will be the base for the quality of attachment.	0.5486701444714965
The mutual regulation of the caregiver-infant-pair enables the child to acquire a psychic capacity to regulate physiological requirements.	0.3922912825766356
This selfregulatory function determines the potential of the later adult to react to distress - in a symbolic way using words or more in a somatic way by developing psychosomatic symptoms.	0.6320290387285497
First experiences with the treatment of psychosomatic patients with respect to the new findings about self-regulation are reported.	0.5878586070590239
A 31-year-old pregnant woman had to undergo emergency abdominal surgery due to acute intestinal obstruction.	0.4820542265913774
The patient's preoperative history demonstrated multiple allergies as well as abdominal trauma several years before.	0.5925773334768357
The physical examination - including sonography of the two fetuses - showed no pathological signs.	0.9145974876160455
Anaesthesia was induced intravenously with the operating table tilted to the left side, using routine precautions pre-oxygenation, and rapid sequence intubation, and was maintained unproblematically.	0.8232723232266714
About 20 min after the onset of surgery, hypotension, tachycardia, and a drop in oxygen saturation appeared.	0.7606258068420354
Volume substitution and the application of vasoactive drugs failed to stabilise the haemodynamic situation.	0.3957590102539147
Elevation of the pregnant uterus and increased left tilzing of the operating table did not lead to improvement.	0.48945695194463185
The development of eyelid edema led to the diagnosis of an anaphylactic reaction.	0.593694085462287
The patient was treated successfully with epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids (prednisolone).	0.6732429258895322
The suspicion of latex-related allergy was verified postoperatively by radio-allergen-sorbent test (RAST) and prick and scratch tests.	0.4354393106995743
The mean arterial blood pressure is decreased during the first two trimesters of pregnancy and increases to preconceptional values during the last weeks of gestation.	0.7105305738574127
The heart rate increases during the whole course of pregnancy.	0.4460191356682967
During late gestation fewer patients show an increase in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in the standing position.	0.44585319492536285
A fall in heart rate was only seen in this period.	0.7300300203953453
A fall in mean arterial blood pressure during standing is not related to the blood pressure in the supine position during the whole course of pregnancy.	0.5741253237544552
The hypotensive symptoms are twice as frequent during early pregnancy compared to late pregnancy.	0.3184555981660565
Headaches, fatigue and cold extremities are the most usual complaints.	0.5523449975610666
The frequency and intensity of these three symptoms decrease during gestation.	0.5939288486282349
Blood pressure in the supine position is reduced in symptomatic pregnant women.	0.4035948403247024
However, the occurrence of these symptoms is not correlated to the fall in blood pressure in the standing position.	0.6947444482301471
The Birth-weight is not influenced by blood pressure in the supine position, but depends on the fall in blood pressure during standing.	0.6007314034387858
Pregnant women with a more pronounced fall in blood pressure give birth to newborns with a lower birthweight.	0.6064200047306617
These results imply a hitherto unknown cause of intrauterine growth restriction.	0.3537177906425481
The combination of saltwater baths and subsequent ultraviolet irradiation is an effective treatment for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.	0.5327913018694135
The aim of the present study was to determine the photosensitizing properties of two commercially available bath salts, original salt from the Dead Sea and sodium chloride.	0.5216683498035689
To address this issue, test areas on the volar aspects of the forearms were soaked with salt solutions for 15 minutes prior to ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation.	0.4549588085782087
The salt concentrations tested were 1%, 3% 5% and 15%.	0.8093838539913305
Tap water followed by UVB and UVB alone served as controls.	0.262282904411666
Erythema was determined by visual and photometric measurement, and delayed tanning was assessed by colorimetry.	0.6180537440258743
Erythema obtained by wetting the skin prior to UVB irradiation was more pronounced than erythema induced by UVB alone.	0.3929267040326718
The most prominent erythema was yielded by tap water+UVB.	0.4168320643626898
The salts had a differing photosensitizing capacity and the strongest erythema was produced by the 5% solutions.	0.4661295933009555
There was only a moderate influence on delayed tanning by bathing the skin prior to irradiation.	0.4278588628214196
The results from the present study indicate that soaking the skin with salt solutions or tap water increases skin sensitivity to subsequent UVB irradiation.	0.5797859023743002
This may contribute to the effectiveness of salt water baths followed by UV irradiation and may account for an increased sunburn risk after bathing.	0.44363206204574196
Introduction: The aim of the study was to evaluate the modern principles of surgery in diverticulitis, e. g. early elective resection and primary anastomosis.	0.6227389549819354
Methods: The data of 445 consecutive patients were retrospectively analysed after classifying all cases in four subgroups according to a modified Hinchey classification (stages 0-III).	0.600176397054702
Results: Within our study group the morbidity was 26.5 % (n = 118) and the mortality was 1.6 % (n = 7).	0.824689288536082
In 96 % (n = 425) of all cases and in 64 % (21/33) of patients with perforated diverticulitis and peritonitis (stage III), a primary anastomosis was performed.	0.9612398469173465
Four patients of the study group showed insufficient anastomosis (0.9 %).	0.8026315752965484
No leakage was observed from any of the anastomoses performed in stage III diverticulitis.	0.5114722424995759
Stage of inflammation and age of patient correlate with morbidity and mortality.	0.513695784979767
Some 53 % (94/177) of the patients in stage II and 67 % (22/33) of the patients in stage III had never showed symptoms of diverticulitis before.	0.9367753860770875
Conclusion: Prophylactic surgery to avoid life-threatening situations, including abscess formation or perforation, is not possible in many cases.	0.895772812082957
However, especially patients at risk (age, coexisting illness) should undergo early surgery.	0.7651373536827731
Primary anastomosis can be performed safely even at an advanced stage.	0.49332791360684597
To evaluate whether MRI is usefull in staging renal cell carcinomas with caval thrombus the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in staging renal tumors with caval thrombus were preoperatively examined.	0.5495298159818016
Tumor staging by CT and MR imaging were correlated with histopathological tumor stadium.	0.5483297403184719
In MRI 4 out of 7 thrombi were correctly diagnosed with high accuracy, in CT none.	0.6105653513073012
In advanced renal carcinoma MRI with Gadolinium was superior to CT imaging, especially in diagnosing tumor thrombus.	0.5391878205549315
Consequently the extent of tumor thrombus may be assessed by MRI which therefore may replace conventional cavography.	0.5092404801943823
Children of mothers chronically infected with hepatitis-C-virus (HCV) during pregnancy and delivery were prospectively followed.	0.5650828013863172
90 children born to 85 infected mothers were included in our study; nine of the mothers were known to be co-infected with HIV-1.	0.6800409719158093
These 90 children were first tested within 60 days after birth and followed for at least three months.	0.5305940498355604
Three of the 90 children became infected perinatally with HCV as shown by persistence of antibodies after 2 years of life and a positive result in the RT-PCR.	0.735212106544917
One of these 3 children has evidence of ongoing hepatitis as shown by slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase values, but is otherwise clinically well, likewise the other 2 infected children.	0.5815344234671546
54 of the 87 uninfected children were followed until they lost maternal antibodies after an average of one year.	0.4487445168858269
Cor triatriatum dexter is a rare congenital malformation in which a membrane divides the right atrium into two chambers.	0.712162277397354
The membrane represents a persistence of the right sinus venosus valve (RSV).	0.4791475153077465
Normally the RSV regresses between the 9th and 15th week of gestation, as the cephalic portion forms the crista terminalis and the caudal portion develops into the Eustachian and Thebesian valve.	0.46515415440772623
Any failure in the regression process may result in remnants of RSV as a simple muscle bar, a Chiari-network or a fenestrated or unfenestrated membrane (cor triatriatum dexter).	0.4359280044878629
We describe a patient with cor triatriatum dexter in whom diagnosis was made several years after successful valvulotomy procedure for severe congenital valvular pulmonary stenosis.	0.5482821067079116
Apoptosis and proliferation are important regulators of normal development and homeostasis in the bone marrow.	0.5099023025891916
Therefore, dynamics of hematopoiesis is mainly defined by these two parameters.	0.4570191699374567
However, since only few data are available from previous studies, we performed a retrospective analysis to elucidate some aspects of this complex pathomechanism.	0.9025157808672304
A total of 400 patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs) and corresponding reactive bone marrow lesions were enrolled into this study.	0.664716894748611
Apoptosis was detected in bone marrow tissue by the ISEL-technique and topoisomerase II  expression was demonstrated by the monoclonal antibody Ki-S1.	0.506619566929857
Furthermore, by determination of the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen labeling (PCNA) index, we were able to calculate the proportion of cells in the G2/M phase, because both nuclear antigens are expressed in different phases of the cell cycle.	0.6737152407370723
Patients with IMF, PV, and ET revealed a normal range of apoptosis, whereas in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) a significant increase could be observed.	0.7491117717954152
On the other hand, IMF and PV were characterized by a raised proliferative activity.	0.3879642196418084
Dynamics of hematopoiesis was assessed by calculation of the so called hematopoietic turnover index.	0.5717679304781432
In CML and reactive lesions no alterations of this parameter were detectable, but IMF and PV showed a significant increase.	0.6545974244770391
Survival analysis disclosed a relevant worsening of life expectancy for patients with reduced apoptosis and proliferation.	0.5390962929079984
In conclusion, our in-situ results confirm and extend previous experimental data on hematopoietic cell kinetics.	0.5084069096090464
In this context, a greater regenerative capacity of hematopoiesis may be reflected by an increased rate of apoptosis and/or proliferation and therefore is associated with a more favorable outcome.	0.7152825940720136
In a complex animal model in sheep, polydioxanone (PDS) and polylactic membranes were used for the reconstruction of large orbital-wall defects.	0.5824746000750862
In a long-term experiment over 1 year, polylactic implants alone showed the best performance as compared with combinations involving autogenous bone grafts and titanium miniplate fixation.	0.4747897452816542
As soon as these polylactic implants are approved for human surgery, they will be used to solve the still challenging problem of anatomical reconstruction of large comminuted fractures of more than one orbital wall.	0.6601180392464597
Surgery by three-dimensional (3D) endoscopy is being used routinely in abdominal surgery and, in special cases, in thoracic surgery; however, it has not been reported as being used in microlaryngeal surgery.	0.7194170328155625
We inserted a 3-D endoscope into a jet laryngoscope and studied the pressure properties at the tip of the laryngoscope as well as intrapulmonary pressures while applying superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation.	0.5184539947368704
The studies were conducted initially using a lung simulator, and then in seven patients undergoing microlaryngeal surgery.	0.6151640745817476
Due to the rather large 3-D endoscope, the diameter of the jet laryngoscope was reduced by between 25.2% and 70.9%, depending on its size.	0.7689076957414611
The measurements on the lung simulator revealed that reduction of laryngoscope diameter leads to an increase in the following parameters: expiratory resistance, tidal volume, and peak inspiratory pressure.	0.658796786587982
The mean FiO2 was 0.74 +/- 0.1; the mean paO2 was 169.2 +/- 80.4 mm Hg; and the mean paCO2 was 40.9 +/- 2.4 mm Hg.	0.7716504129705449
The mean airway pressure was 19 +/- 5.3 mm Hg prior to insertion of the endoscope and 12.3 +/- 6.9 mm Hg after insertion.	0.7507718270811962
The mean positive end-expiratory pressure values increased from 2 +/- 0.6 to 3.6 +/- 2.3 mm Hg.	0.7893158419888346
Reduction of the working pressure resulted in restoration of the initial inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes.	0.573299392779565
In the clinical application of 3-D endoscopy via a jet laryngoscope, it was possible to achieve sufficient ventilation, inspection of the surgical field, and performance of the surgical procedure.	0.8700183390074546
A CO2 laser was used without changing the ventilation regime.	0.36749114900103785
Although technical alterations would be desirable for its application to microlaryngeal surgery, it is presently possible to safely use the 3-D endoscope via the jet laryngoscope for microlaryngeal surgery, presenting the surgeon with new possibilities in voice-improving microsurgery of the larynx.	0.5737680090332209
Kryopreserved specimens of cystic ducts were used for displacement tests to investigate the security of different laparoscopic clips.	0.47150594900621606
The cystic duct was fixed, and the transverse placed clips were distracted in axial direction and the forces registered.	0.516857434089419
The median values of the six investigated clips ranged between 4.1 N and 11.2 N with a highly significant difference (P < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA).	0.6019923272090232
In detail, both resorbable clips (polydioxanone, polyglyconate/polyglycol acetate) were superior to the four titanium clips (P < 0.005, Wilcoxon test).	0.5792565446190565
In addition to the advantage of complete biodegradibility, these data favour the use of absorbable clips because holding force is better than that of titanium clips.	0.6233597173099806
Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.	0.32201510765506697
The efficacy of hemoglobin solutions with respect to O2 transport and especially the effective O2 release to tissues has been demonstrated in a number of situations, such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock.	0.5502082544189629
The hemoglobin molecule could be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications.	0.36895231350798574
This results in a clinically utilizable intravascular half-life of about 8-24 h, an adequate O2 affinity, and a lack of nephrotoxicity.	0.8251059884611825
A degree of vasoconstriction must be mentioned as the persistent side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated here.	0.5051438745009977
In spite of this, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans.	0.5673772101596526
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are, therefore, well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.	0.5556685129380444
The capacity for the release of O2 to the tissues is especially excellent.	0.44803953004916686
This was demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation and also under reanimation.	0.5302250854275066
Perflubron, the most important representative of the fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been successfully used in man and is well tolerated.	0.8035117046279083
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers to clinical practice will greatly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of trauma patients.	0.5386907650513583
Launch is expected within the next few years.	0.3453990466853844
The new volatile anaesthetic desflurane is characterized by very low blood-gas and tissue-blood partition coefficients, so that rapid induction of anaesthesia and shorter recovery times can be expected.	0.5823252649878944
The aim of this investigation was to compare the effects of desflurane and isoflurane on haemodynamics and recovery time when used as part of a balanced anaesthesia technique for elective surgery.	0.6526079807799581
In acute coronary syndromes, arteriosclerotic plaques are characterized by inflammation and decreased smooth muscle cell density.	0.46403062883277263
The underlying pathogenic processes remain unclear.	0.21611171969031462
Among others, increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated.	0.6438172779494096
Coronary atherectomy specimens from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined, using immunohistochemistry (TUNEL test to detect fragmented DNA) and transmission electron microscopy.	0.80673493957205
The objectives of the present study were to evaluate plaque group differences in the cellular composition, to detect and quantify cell death, and to diferentiate between apoptosis and necrosis.	0.7618871865560034
On occasion of the 100th anniversary of heart surgery we present in this article the first successful experimental open heart operations in Russia in the years from 1926 to 1937.	0.5661020083549213
These operations on the stationary heart were carried out by using the first device for extracorporeal circulation.	0.5601412587345881
This work pioneered by Russian scientist S. Brukhonenko and the Surgeon N. Terebinski is nearly unknown to the medical public.	0.4967883743593061
The first and largest series at the time worldwide of more than 260 operations on the valves of the open heart, the still valid prophylactic procedure to avoid air embolism, and principles of open heart surgery stated by N. Terebinski were decades ahead of the development at the time.	0.6905515492782911
In the authors' opinion they represent a milestone in the history of open heart surgery.	0.5324088830422937
Aneurysms of the temporal part of the carotid artery are unusually rare.	0.5948205166905471
The literature contains only a few previous reports dealing with hemorrhage from such malformations.	0.4877777216376422
In the present case massive bleeding occurred from a right-sided intrapetrous aneurym after myringotomy, which was performed as treatment for bilateral secretory otitis media.	0.7523855419029504
Due to the absence of any specific symptoms and the masking effect of middle ear glue preoperative identification of the aneurysm was not possible.	0.7626059719754875
Subsequent angiography showed the large fusiform extension of the intrapetrous aneurysm as well as multiple intracranial aneurysms.	0.4102894674720531
Leakage from the aneurism was closed definitively with muscle, fascia lata and a gelatin-resorcin-formalin-glue (Cardial).	0.33525772521718256
In order to apply the tissue patch the hypotympanic site of the aneurism was exposed using a posterior otosurgical approach.	0.46655842219908683
Due to extensive intracranial collateralization to the vertebral arteries bleeding persisted even after ligation of both carotid arteries.	0.3662037803467637
Temporary cardiac asystole was then induced to allow safe closure of the aneurysm.	0.4243869141300466
Following surgery the patient sustained loss of hearing in her ear and a partial peripheral facial palsy.	0.4732316896207062
Blindness causes human suffering and high social costs.	0.2682542317739729
Virtually all blind people are registered with the social services.	0.3674461843087013
Data from these institutions may help in (long-term) planning for blindness prevention.	0.5293150744762614
The stage-oriented treatment of stem varicosis is the operation method of choice.	0.5264380972924287
Nowadays, partial stem varicosis, which is an earlier stage of the disease, leads to operative treatment more frequently than 10 years ago; thus a sufficient vein stump remains after surgical treatment.	0.7658239683918645
After surgery on a group of 1000 patients, we examined the stumps for patency, the occurrence of varicose changes, for their availability in the long term, and the sufficiency of their length for aortocoronary or peripheral bypass surgery.	0.759037043292213
The treatment of insufficient perforant veins was also included in the surgical therapy, as well as postoperative sclerotherapy of remaining lateral veins.	0.591741316905535
With a follow-up period of up to 33 months postoperatively, the results show a high patency rate in the remaining stumps (97%), as well as a high sufficiency rate (94%), with a mean graft length of 29.4 cm.	0.8084886807439755
Thus these stumps constitute a good natural graft for future vascular reconstructions.	0.3007463176213752
This study supports the call for the stage-oriented surgical treatment of stem varicosis.	0.5239436903806717
Background: Corneal HLA-DR antigens are going to be lost during organ culture storage.	0.44211241995460676
This study investigated if this phenomenon is based on down-regulation of the HLA-DR antigen, or on a loss of the HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells (LCs).	0.5870654987837988
The authors present a rare case of solitary non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the skull of an 11-year-old girl.	0.7080968736277918
The clinical, radiological and histological findings as well as a review of the literature are included in this report.	0.8631323956002759
The morphological features of intra- and extracerebral tumor masses and the change in tumor extension due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging.	0.6303725650447038
Although rare, NHL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of skull tumors in children.	0.48724494992232725
Neurodegenerative and dementing disorders such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease are among the most common diseases of advanced age.	0.4765277877369171
Despite progress in the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, definite diagnosis for most of these disorders is still possible only by neuropathological examination of the brain.	0.7808883082539847
The neuropathological diagnosis and classification of neurodegenerative disorders has made clear advances in recent years, particularly due to the results of genetic and biochemical studies, resulting in the development of new disease-specific antibodies.	0.6677901943765167
Internationally recognized consensus criteria for most neurodegenerative disorders allow a definite and standardized diagnosis to be made.	0.3621274221242932
To obtain further knowledge about the etiopathogenesis, particularly with regard to new therapeutic strategies, studies with clinically and neuropathologically well-documented cases are needed.	0.7017437401291581
The project "Brain-Net" has therefore been established with the aim of setting up a German Brain and Tissue Bank for Diseases of the Central Nervous System.	0.518649385205888
The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.	0.4122067071658043
Fetal surgery is defined as the intrauterine surgical correction of malformations that endanger the unborn child's life in prenatal stages of development or lead to death or severe damage of the child postnatally.	0.5341181022850847
Such surgery is a clinical reality now.	0.5869680936484182
Indications for intrataurine surgical procedures also exist for head and neck abnormalities, especially in the upper respiratory tract.	0.6427793057673599
These include exposure and temporary obstruction of the fetal trachea for correction of pulmonary hypoplasia in cases with congenital diaphragmatic hernias, prenatal tracheotomy in cases of laryngeal atresia for the correction of lethal pulmonary overdistension, and resection of embryonic tumors that obstruct the respiratory tract.	0.5772136510979063
The relatively high surgical risk resulting in particular from preterm labor occurring postoperatively may be reduced by employing minimally invasive techniques.	0.45069266936718133
Endoscopic procedures render opening of the uterus unnecessary and are of particular importance.	0.43762483190727813
In part of the procedures, only endoscopic surgery has led to therapeutic success rates justifying its clinical use.	0.5796635580196229
Further reduction of the operative risk suggests prenatal interventions, even in cases with non-lethal conditions.	0.7632309837250509
More diseases of the head and neck may thus be included in the spectrum of indications.	0.56286429870863
One example is prenatal correction of a cleft lip and palate, which until now has only been performed in animal experiments.	0.6586573815219459
The particular characteristics of fetal wound healing allow this to take place without scarring up to a certain stage in pregnancy.	0.5007666337557449
This offers the prospect of a surgical correction that is invisible externally and avoids growth-impeding scars.	0.38446277075436386
The particular ethical and legal aspects of fetal surgery are discussed.	0.44493354351318354
We report on a 57-year-old patient suffering from a complex malposition of proximal femur after osteosynthesis using a condylar plate.	0.5901589537918676
For polyaxial correction of the proximal femur we successfully used an intramedullary hip screw system.	0.6043157337469972
In 6 patients with primary malignant bone tumors (4 Ewing, 1 recurrent Adamantinoma, 1 maligne Haemangioperizytoma) the local therapy was performed as intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation.	0.8015965461444043
During the follow-up 10 (6-24) months no local recurrence in the replanted segment occurred.	0.7198665720394506
One recurrence occurred in the host bed; in two cases the replanted segment had to be removed because of severe infection.	0.8153221192090491
The other cases showed good functional and radiological results.	0.546995413201513
These clinical findings and the reports in the literature seem to allow the application of the intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation procedure for defect reconstruction in cases of chemo- and radiotherapy-sensitive bone tumors.	0.6694695570870736
Effects of anaesthesia and analgesia on postoperative morbidity and mortality remain controversial.	0.507448272959831
Numerous studies have demonstrated that epidural anaesthesia and pain relief by epidural analgesia reduces perioperative stress responses and thus may reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality.	0.5804687562786028
In patients undergoing vascular surgery, epidural anaesthesia diminished postoperative hypercoagulability.	0.539350157750163
These patients may benefit from less thromboembolic complications as well as a reduced risk of a re-operation.	0.6378013111202171
However, regional anaesthesia does not affect cardiopulmonary morbidity or overall mortality significantly in most clinical studies.	0.4651441297648687
One reason for this disappointing finding may be the missing integration of improved postoperative pain relief into general surgical care.	0.5546015175545553
A multimodal therapeutic approach, which consists of preoperativ patient information, sufficient analgesia, early mobilisation and enteral feeding, may solve this discrepancy.	0.6163859889927317
Therefore, prospective controlled studies are needed to assess the influence of this perioperative approach on outcome.	0.603513756855974
Although cerebrovascular diseases are the most common causes of dementia after Alzheimer's desease, vascular dementia (VD) has remained so far an ill-defined term.	0.6482441896520473
The main problems in the definition of VD arise from finding criteria for both terms "vascular" and "dementia".	0.5826300350572471
The detailed criteria for the diagnosis of VD proposed by several groups or institutions (ADDTC, DSM-IV, ICD-10, NINDS-ARIEN) are critically reviewed.	0.5518617036613014
The diagnostic value of some clinical findings, especially the very frequent white matter luciencies in CT (leuko-araiosis), are discussed.	0.6228290622006281
The available studies suggest a differentiation of VD into some subtypes (listed according to frequency): subcortical VD, VD with acute onset, multiinfarct-dementia, mixed types, and specific forms.	0.49470656050585743
Nevertheless, these subtypes give only little information about the etiology of the underlying vascular process and, therefore, no clear indication for specific therapeutic strategies.	0.715873244867944
The aetiology of varicosis is still unclear.	0.3846173208660828
Investigation of changes in normal veins which result in the formation of varicosis led to examination of elastic properties and histomorphological alterations in the region of the extracellular matrix in the vessel wall of the long saphenous vein in normal and varicose veins.	0.6338140449631106
The rigidity of varicose veins was higher than that of normal veins; there was no difference between the varicose vein above a competent valve and the "normal" vein below this competent valve.	0.5664584528994202
The matrix proteins demonstrated an increase in total fibres, whereas the elastic fibres were reduced and fragmented, explained the rigidity of varices.	0.5830475582391854
These results suggest that the role of the venous valves in the development of varicose veins is secondary to changes of the vein wall.	0.6644671056008691
An investigation of 122 knee joints was performed concerning the incidence and morphological characteristics of the meniscofemoral ligaments (MFL) Humphry and Wrisberg.	0.5489738759983299
Of the knees examined, 96% showed one or more ligaments, the incidence was independent of gender or age.	0.7868365905152694
The osseous parameters of the dorsal and ventral notch as well as the diacondylar width did not correlate with the incidence of MFL.	0.5998435506191714
The ventral notch width index (NWI) after Souryal was 0.22 in females and 0.24 in males.	0.5210926526271267
A dorsal notch width index (dNWI), which has not been described so far, was 0.26 in females and 0.28 in males.	0.7085025625906801
The ligamentum meniscofemorale posterius (Wrisberg) showed distinct morphological variations.	0.42848192438268173
This resulted in a classification of type I-III.	0.69747510249694
The results of the study underline the importance of the MFL for knee joint function including stabilization, proprioception, and meniscal positioning.	0.707733312699994
Eleven patients with high-grade mucosal dysplasia in a columnar-lined oesophagus and 2 patients with a squamous carcinoma (uT1) underwent photodynamic therapy (PDT) and argon-plasma coagulation (APC).	0.6989613002979199
For PDT, 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) was given orally (60 mg/kg) and treated endoscopically with a light dose of 150 J/cm2 (100 mW/cm2) at 635 nm 4-6 h later.	0.7856430941769019
A second PDT was performed under the same conditions 2-3 weeks later.	0.6076373438859188
Patients who received APC were treated 4 times on average to reach radical Barrett mucosa eradication.	0.44695592654907146
All patients were consistently given medication to suppress acid production.	0.4604493520769138
No complications occurred in either group.	0.2849061968425493
Follow-up endoscopies and multiple biopsies for 3-42 months showed squamous regeneration in the dysplastic columnar-lined oesophagus in all 11 patients.	0.45968893905150837
Two patients with squamous carcinoma were found to have a recurrence 9 and 12 months later.	0.8559519893412343
PDT with 5-ALA-induced endogenous porphyrins, as well as APC combined with omeprazole protection, can eradicate superficial high-grade dysplastic mucosa in Barrett's oesophagus.	0.5340812066585893
However, we did not succeed in destroying a manifest carcinoma.	0.6092437050759268
Technical advantages of spiral technology are of great usefulness in diagnostic imaging of thorax and abdomen in children.	0.42361104563008883
The rapid imaging time allows the examination of an entire organ while scanning with breath holding or while the child is quietly breathing, resulting in a decreased need for sedation.	0.4837888338709084
In addition especially examinations of the chest an to some extend CT-investigations of the abdomen are performed with reduced radiation dose achieved by reducing the tube loading.	0.5919173935954128
Radiation dose reduction of 70% is possible without loss of relevant diagnostic information.	0.616824547686442
Spiral low-dose CT in pediatric chest imaging is useful in evaluating parenchymal lung diseases, mediastinal masses and central airway malformations.	0.5203948907632672
Whether abdominal helical CT can be replaced by MRI has to be decided in each individual case.	0.46046391339621884
When an exact protocol is used, sufficient contrast material given, scan-delay optimized and postprocessing reconstructions are performed, usefull additional diagnostic informations are obtained by the method.	0.5008263247370605
Invasive monitoring is a standard procedure in modern intensive care medicine.	0.6837907685797568
Despite significant progress in the routine use and catheter technology, there are relevant remaining risks concerning acute central venous and arterial access and chronic persistence of catheters within the vascular lumen.	0.6258392167064248
Resulting from the infectiologically established novel definition of antiseptic which contains the local application of antiseptics for prophylactical, preventive or therapeutical indication on skin, mucous membrane, wounds, in body cavities or on surgical exposed resp.	0.474214339003576
opened endosomatic areas the antiseptical indications in a branch of dermatology and venereal diseases are represented.	0.35008984169094975
With the analysis of the actual knowledge in vitro and in vivo requirements to local antiinfectiva are defined combined with the recommendations for the clinical use.	0.7593930497945559
At present mainly prophylactically used agents are submitted to a benefit risk analysis with refer to the choice of agents.	0.3883631482310491
Thereby agents for the application on skin as well as on genitals, in mouth cavity and on wounds were taken into consideration.	0.6370431754579668
Hydatid disease, still frequent in endemic areas, is usually localized in the liver.	0.7009571741551457
Despite the benign nature of the disease it is one of the problematic fields of surgery due to the high complication rate and long hospital stay.	0.7268174947960854
Based on our experience we recommend evacuation of the cyst and omentoplasty as the surgical method of choice, as it is associated with a relatively low incidence of complications and can be performed easily.	0.9352879280724443
Background: Central catheters in neonatological intensive care patients are used for the prolonged application of medicataion or parenteral infusions.	0.5570433911382623
Dislocations and septic and thromboembolic complications may occur.	0.33410121032995765
Low density lipoproteins are heterogeneous in particle size, density, and physical as well as chemical properties.	0.47964783630709285
Regarding size and density, LDL can be divided into two main profiles, LDL pattern A with elevated concentration of large, buoyant LDL particles and LDL pattern B with increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles.	0.46665816497274704
The latter is particularly expressed in insulin resistance and is associated with elevated serum triglycerides and reduced concentrations of HDL and particularly HDL2 cholesterol.	0.4582196797225258
The LDL profile of increased concentration of small, dense LDL particles has shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.	0.5121192549317346
The LDL profile is partly genetically determined, but can be improved by non-pharmacological (exercise, diet) and pharmacological intervention.	0.7249809843133485
It remains to be confirmed whether the LDL subfraction profile is an independent lipid risk factor besides HDL2 cholesterol and triglycerides, but it is certainly a valuable indicator assessing metabolic cardiovascular risk.	0.5420372295383604
Traumatic injuries of arteries lead to acute bleeding or ischemia.	0.36460015223457987
In the hand, which is perfused by two arteries, this symptom could be missed.	0.7672599629059454
The hypothenar hammer syndrome is a traumatic occlusion of the distal arteria ulnaris.	0.6347937161867775
Dependent on the mechanism of the trauma the clinical symptoms may appear late.	0.8550390324146512
A specific angiographic or duplex sonographic diagnostic investigation is necessary to show the arterial occlusion.	0.5336472429037356
There is no proven therapeutic procedure.	0.4808081206019958
Exact diagnosis of the occlusion as an effect of the trauma is important for the patient and is the basis of any therapeutic intervention.	0.9661265090802063
The administration of epidural opioids is alternatively used in the management of postoperative analgesia.	0.6005462914657979
However, the administration is associated with side effects, including respiratory depression, somnolence and pruritus.	0.6695578980374568
A rational opioid selection between the hydrophilic and lipophilic opioids morphine, hydromorphone, alfentanil, fentanyl and sufentanil is discussed in this mini-review.	0.5227733709002933
Thus, the administration of the lipophilic opioid sufentanil might has some advantages.	0.6044989378405977
Notwithstanding, epidural opioid administration alone offers no marked clinical advantages compared to the intravenous route.	0.49957597539094284
In future, reduced doses of lipophilic opioids and local anaesthetics like bupivacaine 0.05-0.1% may provide benefits over the use of either drug alone and may offer marked clinical advantages over the intravenous route of opioids alone.	0.6398479572460111
The same holds true for  2-adrenoceptor agonists as adjuvants.	0.4437507794288154
However, multicenter dose-ranging studies are necessary to determine both the ideal concentrations of the drug combinations and the general outcome.	0.6591307221030062
Moreover, we must also determine cost effectiveness for our postoperative analgesic techniques.	0.6332952281716834
Today the relevance of renal tumor embolization is not determined only by the technical and clinical success of the method.	0.6313229509292165
Progress in diagnosis of early stages of renal carcinomas as well as the improvement of both surgical techniques and anesthetic procedures have lead to a change in the selection of patients for embolization.	0.8287679614155944
Preoperative embolization of advanced renal cell carcinomas with tumor thrombus into the vena cava or of T4 tumors is now an established clinical procedure.	0.46803744337275854
The complete occlusion of the vascular bed of the tumors leads to a considerable reduction in intraoperative blood loss and to simplification of the surgical preparation.	0.7705648921744673
By using Ethibloc for embolization, palliation of a hemorrhage or of tumor-related pain in inoperable patients is usually successful.	0.5297955583380138
Although local control of the tumor disease, including complete tumor ablation, is achieved by embolization, the median survival rate of our palliatively embolized patients is only 3.5 months.	0.9376950995353507
This short life expectancy in the group of inoperable patients has to be acknowledged individually in patients considered for palliative embolization who are free of symptoms related to the tumor.	0.6301561989125611
Purpose: To evaluate whether primary stenting is superior to balloon angioplasty (PTA) alone in the treatment of femoropopliteal obstructive disease.	0.6019080205798214
Content of this paper is the current state of the art of robots in surgery and the ongoing work on the field of surgical robotics at the Clinic for Maxillofacial Surgery at the Charité.	0.6513750097787068
Robots in surgery allows the surgeon to transform the accuracy of the imaging systems directly during the intervention and to plan an intervention beforehand.	0.5952024988563503
In this paper firstly the state of the art is described.	0.7318889015925755
Subsequently the scientific work at the clinic is described in detail.	0.5126804349080288
The paper closes with a outlook for future applications of robotics systems in maxillofacial surgery.	0.32696024839781934
Giant-cell bone tumors display a locally aggressive growth pattern, frequently recur if no adjuvant treatment is given, and may potentially metastasize.	0.5620257603586348
By virtue of their biological behavior and typically juxta-articular localization, giant-cell bone tumors require specific surgical management.	0.4201610240759805
Thus, an intralesional tumor excision must be supplemented by adjuvant bone cementing, possibly combined with instillation of phenol or cryotherapy.	0.4716569267708347
These combined treatment modalities assure a high-quality procedure, defined as the actual way medical care is delivered, by promoting the quality of the outcome, defined as the effect of a medical procedure on the patient's state of health.	0.7691287247180667
We report two patients with partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 7 and partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 17.	0.5989487928196443
Chromosomal analysis of the family shows a familial balanced translocation of the chromosomes 7 and 17 in the parents and other relatives.	0.5650216164151515
Pedigree analysis reveals abortions, frequent miscarriages and early infant deaths.	0.26998688255608
Our patients show the same chromosomal abnormality and nearly the same clinical symptoms: prominent forehead, hydrocephalus internus with wide cranial sutures and fontanels, hypertelorism, cleft soft palate, low set dysmorphic ears, psychomotor retardation and micrognathie.	0.4634839285898487
Renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are endowed with impressive metastatic potential.	0.49320182446459565
Patients with RCC who present with apparently solitary metastatic lesions represent a small cohort.	0.3443745643096223
Due to the different long-term results achieved with surgical resection of metastatic RCC lesions, a generally accepted judgement about this treatment modality is not possible.	0.8095760585857875
Several studies suggest that aggressive surgical management can provide an effective treatment, especially in patients with solitary pulmonary metastases.	0.6644807789215141
Most noteworthy is the fact that because of the organ distribution of RCC metastases, surgical therapy is dominated by general and thoracic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and orthopaedic surgeons.	0.6305492000736214
Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach is one of the most important key points for a successful outcome in these patients.	0.8145571888002734
The term Langerhans cell histiocytosis, previously "Histiocytosis X", encompasses three different syndromes: eosinophilic granuloma of bone, Hand-Schüller-Christian disease and Abt-Letterer Siwe disease.	0.39915503787540724

After two years follow-up, no new lesions had appeared.	0.6469772539824173
The diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen is a rare splenic proliferation.	0.5575802639344238
Spontaneous rupture is the main, potentially lethal complication, found in 25 % of cases.	0.7542563902682651
The problem with these vascular tumors is preoperative diagnosis, because they are asymptomatic for a long time.	0.6113402168117779
First-choice therapy is limited resection.	0.454618843236929
In the case of rupture, splenectomy is a life-saving procedure.	0.551495774670376
We report on a 56-year-old woman with a spontaneous splenic rupture as the first symptom of diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen.	0.6476105277311592
Exceptional features of splenic hemangiomas, causes of spontaneous rupture and the therapy are described.	0.47949710068850265
The hypothesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a T cell mediated disease has led to the development of numerous therapeutic approaches that target the function of T cells.	0.6055846137386559
The development of monoclonal antibodies against the T cell surface molecule CD4 has raised hopes to achieve a major progress in the treatment of RA.	0.6080570588079917
However, after encouraging results in early open studies, double blind trials were unable to demonstrate the efficacy of anti-CD4-therapy in RA.	0.6581348628485301
There are numerous reasons to explain the failure of this treatment approach.	0.6332655950009684
Besides the fact that the T cell hypothesis of RA has  repeatedly been challenged, pharmacological problems or an inappropriate selection of outcome criteria have to be considered.	0.5059162688518624
The final evaluation of anti-CD4 therapy  in RA will be possible only after  the testing of newly developed  non-depleting anti-CD4 anti- bodies.	0.529836944670395
Purpose: For some time, the ambulatory diagnosis of respiratory disturbances during sleep has included the use of seven-channel recording units.	0.5676114540363469
One of these systems is the POLY-MESAM unit (MAP, Germany).	0.5879697872279205
Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers of information across the cell membrane by coupling receptors to effectors.	0.516025365173814
A large number of G protein-linked receptors funnel extra-cellular signals as diverse as hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, and primary sensory stimuli through a set of G proteins to a small number of second-messenger systems.	0.4746529938934189
The G proteins act as molecular switches with an "on" and "off" state governed by a GTPase cycle.	0.5818131084981478
By virtue of its high affinity and specificity for guanine nucleotide binding and its intrinsic GTPase activity, the -subunit of the G protein (G) plays the critical role in regulation of the effectors by their corresponding G protein.	0.5859648101964514
Mutations of G may result in either constitutive activation or loss of expression mutations.	0.39229126228543393
Given the variety of functions subserved by G protein-coupled signal transduction, it is not surprising that abnormalities in G protein-coupled pathways can lead to diseases with manifestations as dissimilar as blindness, hormone resistance, precocious puberty and neoplasia.	0.4936264846555329
For a given defect in a G protein-coupled pathway, the extent of the manifestations will also be determined by the cellular distribution of the affected component.	0.7475356835818406
Defects in components expressed exclusively in a single cell type will cause more a focal disorder than defects in a widely expressed component, particularly in germline mutations (e.g., Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy), whereas somatic mutations of genes encoding even an ubiquitously expressed component can cause focal disease when the somatic mutation itself is focal (e.g., McCune-Albright syndrome).	0.45157471284962875
Mivacurium is a short-acting, nondepolarising muscle relaxant of the benzylisoquinoline type that undergoes rapid breakdown by plasma cholinesterase.	0.3681532134600225
After 2.5 times the ED95 (0.2 mg/kg), tracheal intubation can be accomplished within 2-3 min following injection.	0.6778486020646675
The ensuing DUR 25% (i.e., time from injection to 25% recovery of control twitch tension) is three times as long as with succinylcholine.	0.6548535914136704
The principal side effects of mivacurium are facial flushing and a transient fall in blood pressure due to moderate histamine release following doses 3-4 times the ED95.	0.5471666837763877
In patients with end-stage liver or renal disease as well as those with atypical plasma cholinesterase, the duration of action of mivacurium is prolonged.	0.6565552353564936
The performance of new cryoprobes was studied by measuring the spatial and temporal patterns of the temperature distribution in liver tissue around one to three active cryoprobes.	0.5427135102459469
After 15 min of maximal freezing a tissue region 22 mm in diameter was frozen to temperatures below - 50  °C by one active cryoprobe.	0.5019625081251501
With three cryoprobes, using the synergistic cooling effect, a tissue region 45 mm in diameter was cooled to temperatures below - 50  °C.	0.6510616538971777
Optimal placement of the cryoprobes was found to be of critical importance.	0.658426796943439
Attachment representation was assessed in 48 elderly people with an average age of 69 years.	0.4919293763094147
The adult attachment interview was used plus an additional question about wishes for the future.	0.38434028751913224
Coherent correlations with subjective life satisfaction and individual future perspective were demonstrated.	0.29916394910063454
Elderly participants with secure attachment representation were more satisfied, they were also less anxious, and more often positive about their future.	0.6863058202187068
If their adult children had secure attachment representation, they were reported by their elderly parents to be socially, emotionally, and materially more supportive.	0.5588458194923571
Magnetic resonance imaging represents today the most important tool in neuroradiology for both clinical pratice and research.	0.5378986818454645
MRI allows imaging of the human body in 2 or 3 dimensions with variable tissue contrast.	0.684279417916737
The natural diffusion of tissue protons can now be used as a supplementary contrast mechanism.	0.5319530662499783
Different MRI techniques can be used to obtain clinically useful diffusion-weighted images.	0.532647691748548
These techniques all require the use of strong gradient pulses in order to obtain the diffusion contrast.	0.43960707512070035
In the current article, the most important physical principles of diffusion measurement are presented.	0.7695411137641359
After a short introduction into the basic physical principles, we will present the prerequisites and limitations of clinically relevant applications today.	0.7081343932899412
Finally a few select examples of clinical use of these techniques in the acute diagnosis of stroke will be presented.	0.7623978661882034
The effects of chronical strains on physical or psychological health are subject of this paper.	0.4840062982336445
Stress-related symptoms of family caregivers of dementia patients have been proven in various studies.	0.6035335651830254
For this group of people an analysis of the health risc factors is regarded as to be especially important.	0.7005224046569519
Diary investigations allow to identify the individual assessment (by the caring person) of factors related to the care situation and to recognize the health and quality of sleep have been used as indicators regarding the state of health.	0.7968790899975802
In this study strong differences in the individual view of stress factors and their effects on psychological an physical state of the caring person are shown.	0.6685081430069507
The causes of residual deformity with posttraumatic painful arthritis after tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) fracture-dislocation with the need for correctional arthrodesis are in our experience (22 cases over 5 years) overseen injuries in one third, closed reduction and immobilisation or inadequate fixation technique with K-wires in another two thirds of cases.	0.5880544772852658
Foot malalignment and residual instability is assessed with weight-bearing radiographs of both feet, adduction/abduction stress films and CT scans for complex deformity.	0.42638176064166106
Correction is carried out via two longitudinal dorsal incisions, strict epiperiosteal preparation and debridement of the Lisfranc joint of all remaining cartilage, sclerosis and fibrous tissue.	0.3834063535094098
Reorientation begins, in the same manner as primary open reduction, with anatomical alignment of the second metatarsal base to the second cuneiform.	0.8015886966542958
Defects are filled with autologous bone grafting, stable fusion can be achieved with 3.5 mm cancellous compression screws.	0.6999894609537801
Full weight bearing is allowed in a modelled plaster shoe for 6 to 8 weeks.	0.4142071172257835
The functional medium-term results are convincing with 15 of 17 patients seen after 13 months of follow-up working full time.	0.5710312259860373
The Maryland Foot Score improved from 38.9 to 76.8 points in these patients.	0.5710919136571517
The author of this paper deems it very necessary to rename Chinese Tuina, a traditional Chinese medical subject, so as to make Chinese Tuina conform to recent research results and formulation, as well as to combine Chinese Tuina with Western manual medicine at the clinic.	0.5679776194239812
This paper is the result of my research during the period of time was in Switzerland working together with Prof. Jiri Dvorak.	0.6179812675673115
The operability of a liver tumour depends on its three-dimensional relation to the intrahepatic vascular trees which define autonomously functioning liver (sub-)segments.	0.5477882694570945
The aim of our study was to establish a computer-based three-dimensional volumetric operation planning system for the liver.	0.7297742337245378
Methods: Using data from routine helical CT scans the three tissue subclasses of liver parenchyma, liver vessels and liver tumour were segmented semiautomatically.	0.5211624936769459
A dedicated segmenting tool was established using region growing algorithms in combination with an "intelligent" border finder.	0.4545060893727857
Visualisation is performed by the "Heidelberg Raytracer".	0.48354129849526784
The vascular trees are visualised as 3D graphs.	0.3308391716337728
Pseudoconnections between portal and hepatic venous trees are separated automatically.	0.2536043183168229
Security margins are calculated and the system presents a virtual resection proposal.	0.3459630940590826
Results: The 3D anatomy of the liver can be visualised in high quality resulting in good depth perception.	0.5913517937710461
Dependent liver parenchyma can be recognised automatically on the basis of the vascular trees.	0.6033530783170076
The system offers a individualised resection proposal including the tumour, security margin and dependent liver parenchyma.	0.3627132508854598
Conclusion: Three-dimensional presentation of the individual liver anatomy of a given patient facilitates the perception of the pathology.	0.7340590452316845
Virtual reality combined with artifical intelligence allows calculation of complete resection protocols, which can be quantified and modified interactively.	0.5030043398358187
This will make operation planning more objective; patient selection may be improved, and in cases of difficult tumour localisation different resection strategies may be tested.	0.6179040323076175
Thus virtual reality in liver surgery will improve teaching, surgical training and planning.	0.4660106535800405
It may lead to improved surgical care.	0.42037722400269584
Methods to predict the rate of spontaneous relapses in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic agents are missing.	0.5781213619321502
P-wave signal averaging might be helpful in this setting.	0.619068997876835
However, correct validation and standardization is strongly needed for p-wave analysis with the high resolution ECG.	0.6532751168488291
Signal averaging triggered to the p-wave is significantly superior to QRS-triggering.	0.4194493598061038
Bidirectional filtering or FIR-filtering is necessary.	0.16264159425534452
The data indicate significant differences in p-wave duration between patients with and without paroxysmal artrial fibrillation.	0.5565362057682135
Class I antiarrhythmic agents demonstrate a significant prolongation of p-wave duration, but did not influence spectral parameters.	0.6117555853518281
Treatment with sotalol reduces high frequency p-wave energy without altering p-wave duration.	0.47801334716667276
After optimizing the methods, p-wave analysis offers promise to separate patients prone to atrial fibrillation and normals.	0.6686960221776159
In addition, the evaluation of antiarrhythmic efficacy in patients with high risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation might be possible.	0.7279479870872726
In the majority of cases right atrial or ventricular thrombi represent pulmonary emboli in transit.	0.4555226398973917
These may be fatal in patients treated conservatively with anticoagulation only.	0.7358507957118775
In literature the incidence of right heart thrombi in patients with proven pulmonary embolism is said to be in the range of 3 - 4%.	0.7570752876244927
Extremely mobile, long, worm-shaped masses in the right heart cavities carry an especially high early thrombus-related mortality rate which ranges from 30 - 40%.	0.5907484959178053
Current therapeutic strategies favour fibrinolytic therapy with consecutive anticoagulation.	0.3786217549391992
In the last years, several studies addressed the role of the different antithrombotic therapeutics in unstable angina pectoris.	0.8626037881097534
Acetylsalicylic acid still is the standard treatment reducing the rate of death and myocardial infarction by 50% in the first six months.	0.8711957706145885
Ticlopidin has no clinical effect in the first six days and therefore is not suited for treatment in the acute phase.	0.8442297670749871
Unfractionated heparin has an additional favourable effect when added to aspirin.	0.30825455037070293
Low molecular weight-heparin is at least as effective as UF-heparin.	0.524241089718819
Direct thrombin-inhibitors (hirudin, hirudin-analoga) seem to be comparable to UF-heparin.	0.39065637226926364
Pasminogen-activators should not be given in unstable angina, as they show a tendency to worsen the clinical outcome.	0.7741805459592546
GP IIb/IIIa-antagonists (antibodies, synthetic antagonists) significantly improve the clinical effects of aspirin.	0.5179595480322637
When combined with a reduced dose of heparin, their favourable effect remains unchanged, while bleeding complications are reduced to a minimum.	0.7125591513309437
The study presents data on cardiovascular malformations in Bavarian livebirths, born between 1984 and 1991.	0.3904210190786246
Cases have been ascertained retrospectively by reviewing hospital records of all children being referred to a children's hospital up to 2 years of age.	0.5426953100232698
The classification scheme was based on abnormalities in developmental mechanisms.	0.3955320753240303
Severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa with oral involvement often leads to dental destruction and restricted food intake, resulting in malnutrition and maldevelopment.	0.33748145146119657
The patients become handicapped and have a poor prognosis.	0.38040843570187655
We report on a now 13-year-old Turkish child with normal secondary dentition who had severely damaged primary dentition.	0.481718067203611
The teeth were treated surgically and then by continuous dental hygiene measures over the next 7 years.	0.4915240992002179
This care also resulted in an improvement in the nutritional state, associated anemia and the incidence of skin infections.	0.6362818353120305
Although cutaneous blistering and scarring has been progressive, with resulting mutilation of the fingers, the child is socially well adjusted in school and family.	0.5908512449655954
Its clinical course demonstrates that the fate of patients with severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa can be improved through multidisciplinary management.	0.6265612867740511
Our understanding of ulcer pathogenesis has dramatically changed since the discovery of Heliobacter pylori.	0.3429493553716664
Peptic ulcer is now recognized as a chronic gastric infectious disease.	0.3548408729448181
H. pylori can be considered the pacemaker, with other known risk factors ultimately contributing to the ulcer formation.	0.7733263007939594
Treatment of H. pylori in peptic ulcer disease cures the acute lesion and prevents relapse and complications.	0.45195104081240123
In clinical management a positive diagnosis of H. pylori is required and other potential causes for ulcer formation must be excluded before starting treatment.	0.5540449409329165
The standard treatment in H. pylori positive ulcer consists of PPI in standard dose and two antibiotics either clarithromycin 2 x 500 mg and amoxycillin 2 x 1 g or metronidazole 2 x 400 mg and clarithromycin 2 x 250 mg (or 500 mg) for 7 days.	0.5530853008387052
The simultaneous presence of H. pylori and NSAID intake requires distinct management.	0.44613996281664875
Following bleeding complication a PPI needs to be given beyond 7 days until ulcer healing is endoscopically confirmed.	0.38752333896870617
We present the results of a study conducted in collaboration with the German workers' board to monitor the effectiveness of treatment in 477 cases.	0.8326573743291904
The examiners reviewed the charts of patients who had suffered distorsion or luxation of the knee, fractures of the spine with or without neural deficits, calcaneus fractures, rotator cuff lesions and shoulder luxation, and fractures of the acetabulum and pelvis as the result of accidents.	0.7553542163431669
A new documentation sheet was desiged to note administrative and medical data.	0.28620108902649716
All 477 patients' charts and X-rays were reviewed by three trauma surgeons, and procedures were monitored in a prospective manner.	0.6712322929395782
The study revealed considerable discrepancies between the assumed injuries and those ultimately found to have been sustained, especially in the case of knee injuries.	0.6291816634059737
The article reveals the results concerning the validity of the diagnosis and the need for more precisely tailored diagnostic methods for different patient groups.	0.671924304309141
Our final conclusion is that it is necessary to implement new paths of patient management and better steering features to improve both the quality of medical care and the administrative procedures in place.	0.5841712727581977
A workshop on attenuated cold-adapted influenza virus vaccines (CAIV) was organized in Langen, Germany on December 16-17, 1998 by Prof. Reinhard Kurth, President of the Paul Ehrlich Institute.	0.4620222172989636
Reperfusion injury has become a scientific problem of increasing importance, in part because of recent developments of thrombolytic therapy.	0.7027616351079119
The mechanisms of reperfusion injury following focal cerebral ischemia, however, are not known in detail.	0.6869440795063373
Recent studies strongly suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium overload play an important role in reperfusion injury and that pharmacological interventions against calcium- or free radical-mediated damage could extend the therapeutic window in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.	0.553450939665205
The mediators involved are known to induce a mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) during the reperfusion period, which is associated with uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and a burst production of ROS, leading to cellular death.	0.665689436846243
The mitochondrial PT is considered to be a key process in reperfusion injury following cerebral ischemia, as also observed in other organs such as heart and liver.	0.6812763210202833
Pharmacological modulation of mitochondrial permeability changes have the potential to reduce tissue damage due to reperfusion.	0.5010729769581627
We performed an open clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a 1 µg/h ganciclovir implant for the treatment of newly and pretreated cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).	0.5340481229452435
The purpose of this study was to compare the initial stiffness of two techniques for posterior interbody lumbar fusion (PLIF) by a finite element approach.	0.5929254125508705
Thus a finite element model of a human L3/4 spinal segment was generated.	0.47168276850190555
Stiffness of the intact model was tested under compression (600 N), torsion (25 Nm) and shearing forces (250 N) without preload.	0.7107964227518955
The results were compared to the stiffness following simulation of PLIF with two BAK-Cages and PLIF with two Harms-Cages and additional posterior screw-rod-osteosynthesis.	0.4705658595561765
PLIF with two BAK-Cages resulted in a loss of stiffness in compression, torsion and shearing.	0.3721721284345454
PLIF with two Harms-Cages and posterior osteosynthesis resulted in an increase of stiffness in compression, torsion and shearing.	0.47574542373808404
Tramadol, an analgesic with mean potency one tenth that of morphine is used regularely for the treatment of chronic and postoperative pain.	0.6549275570935633
Previous reports have indicated that tramadol may induce seizure activity when given together with a selective serotonine reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).	0.40942283018527137
Therefore, its major mode of action may be questioned which purportedly is due to binding with the opioid receptor and partly due to the inhibition of monoamine reuptake.	0.5666433529924376
Aim: The cause of a connatal hemiplegia was retrospectivly investigated in children born at term.	0.5135287883749908
The article gives a short review on the history of the field.	0.7010725788747056
First forensic cases were solved by the use  of medicocriminal entomology in the thirteenth century but the method has only developed to a professional level over the last 100 years.	0.5180634291924454
In Europe, mainly French, Belgian, English and Scandinavian researchers have been responsible for maintaining the methods.	0.41650407312466087
In France, an entomological police laboratory has been set up in Rosny-sous-bois.	0.4319889036850211
In contrast to the United States of America where entomological evidence is accepted by the courts, the method has only just started to be accepted in Germany.	0.6189475827200996
Initially cooperation with the police and with judges might help to establish the analysis of arthropods as a routine tool in forensic science for Germany.	0.532434817913746
27 patients with sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis (SCC) and/or pustulotic arthroosteitis (PAO) were examined with whole body scintigraphy, conventional radiography, and other imaging modalities, such as CT, MRI.	0.7348707382830622
25 of 27 patients with SCCH showed a characteristic high bullhorn-like uptake of the sternocostoclavicular region with the manubrium sterni representing the skull and the inflamed sternocostoclavicular joints corresponding to the horns (=bullhorn-sign).	0.4352028644839968
Scintigraphy revealed additional skeletal manifestations (spondylitis, sacroiliitis, osteitis, periostitis) in 19 of the 27 patients with SCCH and/or PAO.	0.5024715325380349
In combination with PPP or psoriasis pustulosa, the typical scintigraphic bullhorn pattern enables the diagnosis of PAO (19 patients) with high confidence.	0.7454954103317607
Patients with SCCH but without skin disease at the time of presentation (8 of 27 patients) may develop PPP later and, therefore, it is justified to classify them as incomplete PAO with high risk to develop other skeletal manifestations later in the course of the disease.	0.6893470371279621
PADAM stands for partial androgen deficiency in the aging male, and it is currently diagnosed with a testosterone level below 3 ng/ml (300 ng/dl or 12 nmol/l), and with symptoms varying according to the individual.	0.6785353046513519
The symptoms are a reduction or even loss of libido, a decline in muscle mass and strength, enhancement of visceral fatty tissue-padding, dryness of the skin, apathy, tiredness and distortion of mood right up to depression, and ostalgia due to osteoporosis.	0.5416709628111191
A 34 year-old pregnant woman presented with reticulate pigmentation of the flexures, the dorsum of the hands and the genitoperianal region.	0.5547509710716624
She was in good health and her family history was unremarkable.	0.4014727683135362
Histologic examination of the hyperpigmented patches revealed pigmented filiform downgrowths of the interfollicular epidermis and follicular infundibula, as well as small epithelial cysts.	0.4234749651345101
Upon immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies, the number of melanocytes appeared normal.	0.5336767700432132
The elongated dendritic processes of the melanocytes contained many mature melanosomes.	0.29480699033734276
In the adjacent keratinocytes large melanosomes did not aggregate into complexes.	0.3468604813659086
The diagnosis of localized reticulate pigmentary disorder was established.	0.45470173115005874
The knowledge of the broad clinical spectrum of localized reticulate hyperpigmentations with its favorable prognosis is of practical importance.	0.48084252323697624
Genital or flexural pigmented lesions have to be differentiated from melanosis of the vulva or acanthosis nigricans.	0.4242907311685094
The presented case gives further evidence that many of the proposed entities characterized clinically by reticulate pigmented macules and hyperkeratotic follicular lesions are different phenotypic expressions of the same autosomal dominant genodermatosis.	0.4763138978409114
Purpose: During the last few years there has been an increasing interest in evaluating quality of life (QOL) data regarding surgical treatment.	0.6701289605739096
Methods: The present study comments the efficacy of laparoscopic antireflux surgery after required Nissen fundoplication of 70 patients.	0.5979551930319202
Therefore, the German Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) was used to query the patients preoperatively and three times after surgery up to 1 year.	0.760347694967202
Results: Preoperatively, we found a low general GIQLI score (mean 92.7 points), which increased 6 weeks postoperatively (116.8 points), 3 months (124.8) and 1 year (mean 123.9 points) significantly and is now comparable to the healthy population (122.6 points).	0.840981626679193
Conclusion: It is our opinion that the efficacy of the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with required Nissen fundoplication can also be documented and discussed by using QOL.	0.7491124362559491
Introduction: Serous cystadenomas of the pancreas are rare tumors and thought to be almost always benign.	0.6060875180491739
Methods: We report our experience in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of 12 patients with these tumors.	1.058676192457606
Results: Between October 1993 and December 1998, 41 patients with cystic tumors of the pancreas underwent surgical resection; in 12 cases (11 women, 1 man) a serous cystadenoma (10 micrcocystic, 2 oligomacrocystic) was found.	0.861158350166675
Only 6 (50 %) patients had symptoms.	0.849372984609189
The mean tumor size was 4.8 (2.7-10) cm.	0.9685603087175311
Ultrasound, CT and MRT usually could detect the mass, but differentiation with other cystic lesions was not reliable.	0.6528121242712747
All tumors were resected: 4 Whipple procedures, 7 distal pancreatectomies and 1 segmental resection were performed.	0.48850784589771123
No patient died after surgery and none had to be reoperated on.	0.5306131843879386
Conclusions: Because of the difficulty in reliably differentiating benign and malignant lesions of the pancreas, we believe that cystic tumors of the pancreas should be resected.	0.7454881207356848
We examined the prevalence of HIV-associated cutaneous disorders as well as the frequency and efficiency of UV-radiation in HIV-infected patients by evaluating the clinical records of 1310 patients seen between and 1994 and 1996.	0.7123430772755945
41 patients were treated with UVB-radiation and 4 patients with UVA1-radiation, while three patients received PUVA-therapy.	0.6524286480790628
UV-radiation proved to be efficient and safe in the treatment of pruritic papular eruption, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.	0.5270074481977044
Although some in vitro studies and studies with transgenic mice have suggested a negative impact of UV radiation on the immunosystem of HIV-positive patients, no progression of the HIV infection due to phototherapy has been proven.	0.6370792628354297
The staff at interventional radiological procedures is exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation.	0.4373399557754509
This applies especially to measures at cardiac catheterization laboratories.	0.2860742847407458
In this study the annual radiation exposure to the staff was estimated by measuring the dose rate under characteristic conditions.	0.6474046809302275
It could be shown that the resulting radiation exposure was strongly dependent on the radiation protection measures and is also dependent on the operation conditions of the x-ray tube.	0.6947466756077382
The effective dose for the physician wearing a lead apron and thyroid shield was detremined to about 1.7 mSva.	0.5467902976272093
Without a thyroid shield an effective dose of about 3.5 mSva resulted.	0.5522192615532063
This corresponds to approximately the natural background radiation of about 2.4 mSva in the Federal Republic of Germany.	0.5054344500448607
From the number of procedures performed we could derive an effective dose of approximately 1-2 µSv per application for the physician, averaged over all types of procedures.	0.5718005077850326
Further, it could be shown that the readings of the film badges, usually worn by the staff, underestimate the effective dose by approximately a factor of two.	0.6491972824388581
This is because the film badges do not include the contribution of the unshielded parts of the body to effective dose.	0.6000649060754226
From the estimated annual effective dose, a lifetime dose of 68 mSv was estimated for a 40-year working career.	0.5009989746013035
The corresponding lifetime risk for induced fatal cancer due to radiation exposure was determined to 0.3% applying the ICRP risk factor of 4  -  10-2 Sv-1.	0.6455614327116097
Considering the NCRP recommendations for a safe occupation, working in a cardiac catheterization laboratory can be considered as safe when applying all radiation protection measures.	0.5863702917276157
However, changing the protection measures and modifying the parameters of the x-ray-tube can lead to strong changes of the radiation exposure and the resulting risk estimation.	0.6873036988538317
Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is an important issue in intensive care.	0.6902364138750317
One therapeutic regimen involves the intravenous administration of prostacyclin (PGI2).	0.3034574906538623
This, however, is accompanied by diminished hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, reduced arterial oxygenation, and systemic vasodilation.	0.6794786772732505
Thus, its clinical usefulness is limited.	0.5868333544073427
However, the inhalation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide (NO) or nebulized PGI2 causes a selective pulmonary vasodilation in ventilated alveoli and improved gas exchange, without any systemic vasodilation.	0.5658256567327432
It has therefore gained importance for the treatment of pulmonary failure associated with high shunt fractions.	0.6479892971280934
However, the inhalation of vasodilators may have adverse effects: in the case of NO, toxic side effects are predominant (MetHb, NOx), whereas in the case of PGI2, technical problems in terms of dosing and administration safety are of major interest.	0.6688643582659726
Furthermore, some patients do not respond to the treatment.	0.7224924385630378
In some individuals a reduction in pulmonary hypertension can be seen, while others lack even pulmonary vasodilation.	0.6182578279778126
The exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be investigated.	0.3446912370199768
The treatment of infrarenal aortic aneurysms by means of transluminally placed endovascular prostheses reflects significant progress in the field of vascular surgery.	0.4652549419791097
In the case of infrarenal aortic aneurysm it is possible to achieve technically successful implantation of such a prosthesis in well over 90 % of cases.	0.6712111664061912
The rate of clinical success, meaning lasting effective exclusion of the aortic aneurysm, cannot (yet) be definitively determined, since no long-term results are so far available.	0.6783730798897387
Secondary leaks are observed in at least 10 % of all patients, making a further therapy necessary (endorepair, conversion, embolization).	0.6872788306578953
Further development of endovascular prostheses will include optimization of the aortal/iliac attachment of the prostheses, a better configuration and the development of long-lasting materials that can be used for endovascular prostheses.	0.7281055373181784
The frequency of postspinal headaches after accidental puncture of the subarachnoid space with 16 - 18 G Tuohy needles is reported at 59 - 85%.	0.5618596009335571
A case of postspinal headache syndrome persisting over a period of 6 weeks following epidural anaesthesia during labour is described.	0.4756712835217036
A 30-year-old women had severe postspinal headache for 6 weeks after epidural anaesthesia during labour.	0.5923613560023706
Conservative therapy for 3 days and 4 days of bedrest followed by cristalloid infusions during a 3-week hospital stay and a subsequent 3-week period of bedrest at home did not lead to lasting pain relief.	0.5685048952317949
Intracranial haematoma and other abnormal processes were excluded by CCT.	0.3063623702925131
A pathologic EEG was not confirmed by cranial MRT.	0.29325693297747907
A lumbar epidural blood patch of 15 ml of autologous blood was performed at L3/4.	0.589716483715754
The patient stayed in bed for 12 h. After 3 h free of pain the patient complained of recurring headache.	0.6418651232836706
After a further 48 h of bedrest she had recovered.	0.3912140446493881
Because of lumbar pain 4 days after the epidural blood patch a MRT was performed, which showed the blood at L4 to S3 in the epidural space.	0.6103165027964895
The diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage was based on the history and the main symptom of postspinal headache: the pain onset in the supine position.	0.8100560712946736
Such possible treatments as diminishing subarachnoidal pressure by bedrest, increasing cerebrospinal fluid production by infusions, increasing epidural pressure by epidural infusions and closing the cerebrospinal fluid leakage by epidural blood patch are discussed.	0.43762513305421574
The average success rate with the epidural blood patch is 93%.	0.4222544274963989
Volumes ranging from 5 to 20 ml are discussed for the autologous blood.	0.4335102153909469
We chose 15 ml of blood, to take account of the possibility that blood might settle in the wide sacral space.	0.6093706242624702
We were able to document the position of the blood patch as L4 to S3 on MR tomography (the injection site was L3/4).	0.6564284009839206
Most patients are free of headache 1 h after epidural blood patch.	0.492502850420727
Our patient had to be confined to bed for another 48 h because of recurring headache.	0.4546710896195116
The blood patch alone was not immediately sufficient to prevent all further cerebrospinal fluid leakage.	0.4892863703299608
Probably more than one subarachnoidal puncture had been made during the difficult epidural anesthetic procedure.	0.5063989478478628
On the other hand, the leak was probably only diminished because of the blood patch descending down to the wide sacral space.	0.6015895379315672
The combination of the large-volume blood patch, which diminished the leakage, and conservative treatment, which narrowed the transdural pressure difference, was successful: the 6-week postspinal headache was cured.	0.7705008485791307
Prolonged postspinal headache should be treated by epidural blood patch.	0.5170192457055106
The use of over 10 ml cannot be generally recommended, although in this case most of the blood patch of 15 ml was localized caudally.	0.7476170307493791
Careful monitoring for side effects is necessary with blood volumes larger than 10 ml.	0.41908712125516273
If there is no immediate relief, conservative therapy with 24 - 48 h of bedrest is recommended.	0.6754255068356606
If the headache persists a second blood patch should be performed, with the volume and the probable caudal spreading of the first taken into account.	0.7634101073342208
The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of carvedilol therapy in addition to conventional heart failure therapy on heart rate variability (HRV) and on left ventricular function in 14 patients with mild to moderate heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).	0.6791817289667312
After a 3- to 4-week titration period, carvedilol was titrated up to 50mg daily, or the highest dose tolerated (at least 25mg daily).	0.7299807348277891
Maintenance treatment was then continued for 8 weeks.	0.42368940445845477
Digital 24-hour Holter recordings were obtained at baseline and after 8 weeks of carvedilol therapy.	0.5647713900460435
HRV for the entire 24-hour period was computed in the time domain using the Oxford Medilog Excel 2 analysis system.	0.5070321021200666
Measures of HRV included the mean of all coupling intervals between normal beats (RRm), the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals (SDNN), the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals (rMSSD), and the proportion of adjacent normal RR intervals differing >50ms (pNN50).	0.5799836027707354
The histologic determination of the degree of tissue anaplasia and grade of malignancy of gliomas is based upon qualitative histological features (nuclear pleomorphism, mitoses, endothelial proliferation, tumor necrosis).	0.5697563885304137
This grading approach is influenced by the subjective interpretation of the pathologist, especially concerning the weighting of criteria (scant, moderate, pronounced).	0.5886176748690233
An observer-independent approach seems to be feasible by abandoning the concept of parameter weighting in favor of an binary approach noting only the presence or absence of these structure parameters.	0.4104170610328839
This grading procedure is recognized in the revised WHO classification of brain tumors for common type astrocytomas (Ste.	0.46956013481397807
Anne-Mayo System, SAMS).	0.2429608740512303
Our results indicate that a similiar approach is also suitable for grading purposes of oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas.	0.39966310288886575
Our recent investigations on glioma grading showed, both for astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, that a two-tiered grading scheme distinguishing only "low-grade" and "high-grade" cases was prognostically relevant.	0.720901095058737
For all glioma entities the onset of tumor angiogenesis with endothelial proliferation and contrast enhancement in CT and MRI seems to be the key criterion indicating irreversible tumor progression to the "high" malignancy grade.	0.6179288554495808
In patients with severe angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease, who are not candidates for either percutaneous coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery, transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR) often leads to improvement of clinical symptoms and increased exercise capacity.	0.6883849677685699
One drawback of TMR is the need for surgical thoracotomy in order to gain access to the epicardial survace of the heart.	0.5222836036496449
Therefore, a catheter-based system has been developed, which allows creation of laser channels into the myocardium from the left ventricular cavity.	0.8437684816419271
Several phase III studies have proven that the beta-interferons have positive effects on the number and severity of acute exacerbations of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.	0.5360124481670757
Recently the first study on the effectiveness of interferon beta-1b in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis was published.	0.5829854028268739
In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study 718 patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) value between 3.0 and 6.5 were treated with either 8 Mio.	0.6141872749078995
interferon beta-1b or placebo subcutaneously every second day for two to three years.	0.4192175615771596
The primary study end-point was the time until confirmed progression of the disease as signified by a one point increase of the EDSS value (for initial EDSS values between 3.0 and 5.5) or 0.5 point increase when the initial EDSS value was between 6.0 and 6.5.	0.8059890984751849
After two years an interim analysis showed a highly significant difference in delay of disease progression by nine to twelve months for the treatment group (p=0.0008).	0.6162003486221366
This means that interferon beta-1b is the first recombinant beta-interferon to be shown effective in the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.	0.5716160690236693
To test the effect of dorzolamide on accommodation or pupillary function.	0.384948047375198
Cases of female patients who suppose having been sexually abused by their fathers during (early) childhood and wish to explore and work on healing this trauma are being discussed.	0.42204717816749693
As a result of projection and counter transference the therapist developes feelings of distrust, disbelief and of being involved in a "hysterical theatre performance" so that this sort of therapy is very difficult to conceive and carry out.	0.5594447238030591
In this contribution an attempt is being made to understand these patients and to examine their psychodynamic background as well as the deeper meaning of their above mentioned theatrical efforts.	0.5495553856791219
On the basis of these cases we can put the following psychodynamic hypotheses: 1) The incest-phantasy is a narcissistic attempt; 2) The incest-phantasy is a symbolic representation; 3) in the sense of a symbolic wish-fullfillment included in the parent-child-interaction.	0.608643308739405
After this, an attempt is being made to examine in various therapeutical scenes the role of these phantasis during the transference procedings and finally to develope diagnostic criteria with which these patients can be differentiated from others with definitely witnessed sexual abuse cases so that consequently treatment techniques can be devised in future.	0.49443155367534136
Hospitals and clinics for ambulant surgery shall identify and register certain officially defined nosocomial infections (Surveillance) as well as the isolation of bacteria with special and important antimicrobial resistancies (§ 23 Abs.	0.46724658357859966
1 IfSG = Infection Prevention Act).	0.18201512203872683
The nosocomial infections to be recorded, i. e device associated infections and postsurgical woundinfections, have been selected on the basis of national and international experiences with the surveillance of nosocomial infections.	0.5943132154344278
Important antimicrobial resistancies have been determined according to both the prevalence of the bacteria in nosocomial settings as well as their clinical and epidemiological importance.	0.6145879746259674
Most of the relevant data may be provided by the clinical microbiology laboratory but shall be collected, listed and discussed by the staff of wards or surgery clinics.	0.5616635891733128
Both types of documentation shall be used to identify and eradicate problems in hygiene management and to stop further distribution of difficult to treat bacteria like MRSA.They are part of the quality assurance management according to § 137 SGB V.	0.5675728782518025
Nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) belong to the most frequent malignant tumours in certain parts of the world, e. g., south-east Asia, while they occur infrequently in western  Europe.	0.5745126160219816
The association of NPCs with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a transforming human herpes virus, is well established.	0.5806417907695358
The current WHO classification recognises two major NPC histotypes, non-keratinising NPC and squamous cell NPC.	0.3803838825867089
EBV is invariably present in non-keratinising NPCs and the viral oncoprotein LMP-1 (latent membrane protein-1) is expressed in some cases.	0.6143168724934694
The tumour cells of non-keratinising NPCs show phenotypic features which are inducible by LMP-1 in  vitro.	0.443109741275039
These may contribute to the development of the lymphoid stroma which is characteristic of this tumour type.	0.6267231304491594
Furthermore, the virus is detectable in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in situ.	0.4930877249422192
Thus, the virus is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of  non-keratinising NPCs.	0.7705820764160392
By contrast, the association of squamous cell NPCs with EBV  displays a geographical variability.	0.5926690214946232
It appears, therefore, that squamous cell NPCs are a heterogenous group of tumours distinct from non-keratinising NPCs.	0.4993545625555546
To assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors following postoperative external radiotherapy in 77 patients with low-grade glioma.	0.5694591663011288
Between 1977 and 1996, 45 patients with astrocytoma, 14 with oligodendroglioma and 18 with mixed glioma received postoperative radiotherapy with a median total dose of 52 Gy (range, 45 to 61 Gy).	0.6232977536083072
Sixty-seven patients were treated immediately following surgery, 10 patients with tumor progression.	0.9549525417002369
The influence of various factors including histology, gender, age, seizures, duration of symptoms (<= 6 weeks vs > 6 weeks), CT pattern (enhancement vs no enhancement), type of surgery, total radiotherapy dose and timing of radiotherapy on relapse-free survival and overall survival was investigated.	0.6993792552354512
The median overall survival time was 81 month, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 54% and 31%, respectively.	0.8922636578205132
The median time to progression was 56 months, while the 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates were 45% and 24%.	0.888997515799604
Univariate analyses identified the total radiotherapy dose (p = 0.01), duration of symptoms (p = 0.05), the presence of seizures (p = 0.04), and the CT pattern following intravenous contrast (p = 0.005) as significant prognostic factors for overall survival.	0.656816968208029
Progression-free survival rates were influenced by the total dose (p = 0.04), the duration of symptoms (p = 0.01) and CT pattern (p = 0.006).	0.671996401011601
On multivariate analysis, only the CT pattern (enhancement vs no enhancement) remained as independent prognostic factors for both progression-free survival and overall survival.	0.590847628765638
A minimum total dose of 52 Gy is recommended for the postoperative radiotherapy in low-grade glioma.	0.7375725865092442
Tumors with CT enhancement seem to need further intensification of treatment.	0.28616258144423895
We report three patients with severe Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).	0.596272035967808
On clinical examination, no sensory deficit was elicited.	0.5191869854894834
Electromyography (EMG) and motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies were indicative of an axonal lesion.	0.45805559034172294
In two patients, we found total peripheral conduction block without volitional EMG activity.	0.6780747806928867
Sensory NCV and cortical median nerve evoked potentials remained normal.	0.2385812198316052
Sural nerve biopsy revealed unequivocal alterations of sensory nerve fibers, some in the form of primary demyelination.	0.489885568670254
Therefore, these cases must bei classified as combined motor-sensory syndromes despite the clinical and electrophysiological findings.	0.6443752851638829
Although total denervation of the extremity muscles occurred, causing tetraparalysis, this manifestation appears to be attributable to the secondary axonal variant.	0.6044527560861418
In contrast to positive reports in literature, immunomodulatory treatment proved ineffective in all three cases.	0.5242393390422954
Continuous spinal anaesthesia (CSA) is a further means of central nerve block for anaesthesia besides single-shot spinal (SSS), combined spinal/epidural, and epidural anaesthesia.	0.6026507611612282
Do hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected food handlers represent a risk for the consumer?	0.5093210028532256
Epidemiological data on HCV transmission  in our opinion do not provide a basis for excluding HCV positive individuals from working as food handlers in general.	0.5589457667900314
Such restrictions seem to be justified only if HCV infected employees might infect their colleagues while performing occupational activities that are associated with a high risk of contracting percutaneous injuries and overt bleeding.	0.5373834016256833
Recently, good functional and anatomical results have been reported in treating full thickness macular holes.	0.7149853241492704
Only a few studies describe a removal of a membrane at the vitreoretinal interface after having removal of the vitreous and its cortex.	0.5897272430045835
To demonstrate the beneficial effects of removing this membrane at the vitreoretinal interface we present our functional and anatomical results in this retrospective study.	0.5451272982126885
Dementia-screening in clinical routine requires short, sensitive and specific tools.	0.5214288207587485
A number of standardized instruments are available for this purpose.	0.6747238210665354
The present study analysed the relationship between size of three examplary dementia-screening tests and their diagnostic accuracy.	0.5440266640194968
A phlebological report requires that an exact diagnostic investigation of the peripheral vein system be carried out to assess both function and morphology.	0.5241854568551968
The most important, reproducible findings can be obtained using dynamic phlebodynamometry and ascending pressure phlebography, as a second expert can directly reconstruct the process by which assessments have been made.	0.7117248095274259
Additional quantification information can be obtained by measuring reflux using colour- coded duplex sonography.	0.4915475473208276
A thrombophilic condition should always be investigated in terms of haemotasis.	0.4209965716807223
In patients with severe post-thrombotic disease, a chronic compartment syndrome of the posterior spaces should be reckoned with, and in such patients magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and, if possible, dynamic compartment manometry are additional suitable methods of examination.	0.8214043441636494
There is currently no generally valid schematization of the post-thrombotic syndrome on which to base an expert opinion.	0.4211920471166594
When evaluating patients, we largely follow our own new classification, which distinguishes four stages based on clinical tissue sclerosis.	0.6236479544490621
Since systemic treatment of neuropathic plantar ulcers in diabetics (DNPU) has so far been rather ineffective, recent reports of successful management of DNPU by short-term retrograde transvenous leg perfusions (RVP) by South American angiologists encouraged us to apply this treatment method in diabetics suffering from chronic DNPU.	0.538398212674485
Hence, in a prospective comparative clinical trial started in 1989 we have treated 45 male diabetics suffering from DNPU with the same daily doses of netilmycin, administered either in systemic venous infusions (SVI: n=21, three times/day) or in RVP (n=24, once/day).	0.6724137512107679
After 10 consecutive days of treatment, ulcers had closed in 8 of the 24 patients treated with RVP, as against 3 of the 21 treated with SVI.	0.6248404202000795
Diminution of the ulcer area by >30% including full debridement was achieved in 10/24 of the RVP cases (SVI: 4/21).	0.606031408976671
During 6 months of follow-up, amputation of toes or forefoot was necessary in only 1 patient in the RVP group, but in 4 in the SVI group.	0.7281613874295478
Partial restitution of osteolytic damage was observed in some cases after RVP.	0.5439388636943241
Our results show that regional netilmycin therapy given by the RVP procedure is clearly superior to equal netilmycin doses administered by SVI for the treatment of DNPU.	0.4021778942931715
RVP can be recommended in DNPU, particularly when the ulcers are complicated by infections.	0.6634484244711427
There is hardly any other discipline that illustrates the conflict between the freedom of science and research, that is to say, ultimately, what is medically possible, and human dignity and the protection of life or, in other words, what can be justified in ethical or legal terms, so clearly as reproduction medicine.	0.6490192818961837
The topics involved in this conflict cover a broad spectrum, ranging from in vitro fertilization with subsequent implantation of the embryo through the problems of multiple pregnancy and selective feticide, the many questions raised by assisted fertilization, and especially by anonymous sperm donation, and the controversial techniques of preimplantation diagnosis and cryopreservation, to the legal aspects of prenatal diagnosis, some of which have already been the subjects of cases decided in the supreme courts.	0.7052636682165602
In a good many of these sectors it is difficult to reconcile what doctors can do and what it is admissible for them to do, so that it is hardly surprising that there is often no general consensus.	0.5140063989616651
Against this backdrop objective discussion is all the more important, and the notes in this paper, which necessarily touch on only some of the matters at issue, are intended to stimulate such discussion.	0.6479728959833969
In MR-imaging, similar to computed tomography, diagnosis of metastatic lymph-node disease is based on lymph-node sizes, and thereby it is non-specific.	0.7482654194603172
Superparamagnetic iron oxide as a potential contrast medium for MR-lymphography accumulate in normal lymph node tissue after endolymphatic, interstitial and, in case of very small particles, after intravenous injection.	0.6045618974205976
No accumulation occures in lymph node metastases.	0.41840426575643114
Lymph-node metastases can be detected by all three injection techniques.	0.6669966177750525
It has been shown experimentally, that in particular small metastases can be detected in normal sized lymph nodes.	0.8159945268270654
However, MR-lymphography also has inherent methodologic problems, as there may occure an uneven distribution of the contrast medium between different lymph-node groups.	0.7372988285397735
The experimental results with endolymphatic, interstitial, and intravenous MR-lymphography as well as first clinical results with intravenous contrast medium injection are presented and discussed.	0.6488107118178688
The purpose of this study was to evaluate anatomical and functional results of vitreoretinal silicone oil surgery for complicated retinal detachments due to trauma and myopia in children and juveniles.	0.6025076709995473
In 1993, we adopted conventional thoracic and abdominal prosthetic grafting and tailored aortoplasty (TAP) of the thoraco-abdominal aortic segment III/IV in chronic-expanding type B aortic dissection (CEAD) to achieve 2 primary goals: 1. reduction of renal/visceral and spinal cord ischemic time; 2. safe and secure reperfusion of all critical aortic branches for prevention of major complications, i. e. paraplegia, kidney failure, and intestinal infarction.	0.666000791851974
Among 71 thoracoabdominal aortic reconstructions since 1993, 5 CEAD patients (median age 47.8 yr, mean CEAD- 6.5 cm, 4 with Marfan Syndrome) underwent TAP.	0.8373199313411859
Selection criteria are: 1.	0.3883446612099028
CEAD- >5 cm 2. expansion rate >=5 mm/6 months 3. involvement of the critical aortic segment III/IV.	0.7054393963778105
TAP consists of: 1. left posterolateral aortotomy from Th 8 - L 2, 2. excision of the intraaortic dissection membrane(s) 3. aortic closure to a diameter of 3 cm to reduce wall tension.	0.7465393591970714
All 5 patients survived without any major complications, particularly no paraplegia.	0.5414390653567436
Mean cross-clamping was 43 min.	0.34645185091736885
After 7 months, 1 patient was successfully repaired due to false aneurysm at the distal thoracic graft suture line.	0.6142537286507458
After mean follow-up of 2.4 years, CT-angiography revealed a stable TAP segment (mean aortic- 3.2 cm) in 4 patients and one re-expanded TAP segment (from 4 cm after 24 months up to 7 cm) without signs of re-dissection.	0.8715256996901164
Our 4-year-results (1) corroborate the Johns Hopkins data.	0.6090824808066092
Although one re-expanded TAP segment is disquieting, we found the short-term gains so rewarding to strongly advocate the tailored approach as a principle means of avoiding paraplegia in this extremely high risk group of patients.	0.5504135729129419
All optically active molecules have at least one asymmetric atom in common which is attached to four ligands, that can have different three dimensional positions.	0.5454178037292581
Therefore it can be concluded that the resulting isomers are chemically identical in all respects except for the direction with which they rotate plane-polarized light.	0.5060716527434164
When the isomer and its corresponding enantiomer are present in equal proportions, they are called racemic mixture, a mixture that does not rotate polarized light, since the optical activities of the two isomers cancel each other.	0.6225996757018817
Although the isomers are chemically identical other optically active molecules can interact with these isomers in a geometrically specific way termed stereoselectivity.	0.3570472693643932
The human body comprises a chiral environment due to optically active proteins; thus it is not surprising that enantiomeric drugs exhibit different pharmacological properties, when used as pure optical isomers.	0.5658301980128452
Till today most modern anaesthetics have been optical isomers, which are mainly used as racemic mixture (1:1 mixture).	0.739149045235531
For financial reasons pure isomers were only used for research purposes, but nowadays the wide clinical use of pure isomers is financially feasible due to new production techniques.	0.512437570828322
The terms eutomer and distomer were chosen to indicate the more or less potent form of the drug.	0.5531554883332627
The clinical use of pure isomers is only of advisable, if there are significant differences between eutomer and distomer in desired or side effects.	0.6343535690933955
Among the modern anaesthetics ketamine, isoflurane, bupivacaine and atracurium exhibit an asymmetric carbon.	0.3631115246281096
For most drugs the separation in pure isomers will reduce side effects.	0.3033963966361667
For volatile anaesthetics this question is still unanswered, since experimental and clinical results are inconsistent so far.	0.542657234425831
The high prevalence of aspirin intolerance in asthmatics and patients with nasal polyps as well as reports of familial clustering suggest a genetic disposition of this disease.	0.5313031605758237
Our study aimed at obtaining further evidence of hereditary factors in this disease.	0.450498559698675
We included 33 unselected patients from 28 families with aspirin intolerance and rhinosinusitis in this study.	0.39975685746965733
Controls were recruited from individuals treated in our ENT clinic for diseases other than aspirin intolerance (n=52).	0.43229206494552413
The application of a tryptophan-free amino acid mixture (tryptophan depletion test) induces a rapid and substantial lowering of both total and free plasma tryptophan.	0.548235834050118
Consequently, the brain serotonin content and also cerebral serotonin function are decreased.	0.5055604242705136
This method provides a paradigm to study the role of serotonin in the pathobiology of depressive disorders and their treatment modalities.	0.4695096396399385
Untreated depressed patients show few behavioral effects during tryptophan depletion.	0.2703138300895671
In depressed patients during an antidepressant or light-therapy-induced stable remission, a transient depressive relapse was induced by tryptophan depletion.	0.5285631564046851
Healthy subjects with a genetic risk for affective disorder show worsening of their condition induced by tryptophan depletion.	0.4675218261847148
These findings indicate the relevance of altered brain serotonin function in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and strengthen the importance of serotonin in the mechanism of action of antidepressants.	0.5604457476981053
Since recently published studies revealed some evidence that the serotonergic system is directly involved in the pathophysiology of various psychiatric syndromes besides depression, it seems to be reasonable to evaluate the validity of the tryptophan depletion test also in non-depressed patients.	0.634368439321538
Several common chronic pain syndromes come to the attention of the rheumatologist demanding for differentiation from fibromyalgia (FM), although they are often associated with it.	0.5315090691970459
They may mimick FM by (1) the occurance of wide spread pain, (2) the chronicity of complaints, (3) the preponderance of females in some of these, and (4) the lack of objective data to be derived from imaging techniques and laboratory tests.	0.7451164249888785
Pain is produced by the disturbance of normal function ("dysfunctional syndromes", MASI, ref.	0.5850589349840482
Recognition requires examination of the locomotor system under biomechanical auspices both at rest and during movement in order to diagnose hyper- and hypomobility syndromes; treatment of these conditions is guided by principles to improve biomechanical function.	0.6398096222329004
In addition, the skin needs to be examined to detect panniculosis (also called "cellulitis"), which may be mixed up with FM due to its preferential occurance in peri- or postmenopausal women.	0.7108191494728089
It is concluded that the aforementioned differential diagnosis needs to be considered appropriately in coinciding FM and all studies dealing with FM.	0.5167414138909693
In a prospective, randomized study of patients with acute manifestation of coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol >=130<=250mg/dl), we compared the effect of an early-initiated, intensified therapy to usual care antilipidemic therapy with respect to coronary lesions and clinical events.	0.7331789037580061
Patients were included immediately following acute myocardial infarction and/or PTCA because of severe/instable angina pectoris.	0.591583143453738
The intensified therapy consisted of pravastatin 20-40mg with addition of colestyramine and/or nicotinic acid, if necessary, to achieve an LDL cholesterol <=130mg/dl.	0.5531347596228001
In the control group, antilipidemic therapy was left up to the private physician.	0.5062342504687234

Abrupt vessel closure of the dilated vessel continues to represent a significant limitation of coronary angioplasty.	0.5033791176445692
Despite increasing operator experience and improved technology, abrupt vessel closure continues to represent the most important complication of balloon angioplasty.	0.522655775882357
Intracoronary stent implantation and pharmaceutical blockade of the GP IIb/IIIa receptor serve as effective tools in the prevention of abrupt vessel closure without completely resolving this problem.	0.43960647790699525
About 50% of patients presenting with abrupt vessel closure exhibit additional complications including myocardial infarction, necessity of CABG or death occurring in up to 10% of acute occlusions.	0.6705176122477305
The purpose of this study is to evaluate if quantitative coronary angiography and assessment of clinical and laboratory data allows risk stratification concerning the probability of abrupt vessel closure.	0.7799012950571209
PTCA in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is associated with a markedly increased risk of abrupt vessel closure, indicating that different risk factors may contribute to the development of abrupt vessel closure in patients presenting with stable angina or acute coronary insufficiency syndromes.	0.6432546974161057
Since the skin dose becomes the limiting factor while deciding the tumorcidal dose, the detailed analysis of dose distribution in the build-up region is necessary for high-energy photon beams.	0.5904771405189718
In this study the beam characteriwstics affecting the build-up and skin dose for 6- and 18-MV photons are analyzed.	0.7497282923674403
Measurements were made with 6- and 18-MV photons using a PTW parallel-plate ionization chamber (B23344-036) and a RDM-1F electrometer.	0.6377175091849362
Build-up ionization measurements were made with the chamber fitted into a 25 x 25 x 25 cm polystyrene phantom with a fixed SSD of 100 cm.	0.439324157797886
The entrance and buildup dose measurements were made with a polycarbonate and a mesh type metallic shielding tray and a 45 ° wedge.	0.38614292973944675
Exit dose measurements were carried out for the graphite patient supporting assembly table top, 1.0 cm thick piece of wood and the 1.0 cm thick patient supporting perspex base frame for head and neck treatments.	0.5819857200930071
It was observed that the dmax decreased slightly with field size as with other accelerators.	0.43982232604320115
For both photon energies the surface dose was observed to increase with increase in field size.	0.5304352079642198
It was also noticed that the dose in the build-up region increases slightly when the polycarbonate secondary blocking tray is introduced with the increase in surface dose.	0.5587214876087905
The data show that the tray pertubation factor (TPF) at surface decreases steadily with tray-surface distance for both photon beams for all field sizes.	0.5203092965978324
It was noted that the TPF was more when the polycarbonate tray was introduced at shorter tray-surface distances for both energies.	0.41844058896693603
At tray-surface distances above 60 cm the TPF almost remained close to unity for 6-MV photons for all field sizes, whereas the continuous decrease in TPF could be noted for 18-MV photon beams even after the TPF rewached unity.	0.5238782611818233
The increase in surface dose with field size for both photon energies is due to the electron scattering from the intervening materials.	0.5061496430415378
The use of wedge filters absorbs low-energy scattered electrons siginificantly and hence, the relative surface dose (RSD) is always less than unity.	0.5673504857900112
The increase in dose enhancement percentage with graphite compared to perspex supporting assembly indicates that the electron backscatter is proportional to the atomic number of the medium.	0.39375459029213095
We investigated the nutritional value of a very low fat diet (diet I) adapted to nutritional habits in Germany.	0.6492628346249208
Data were compared to a low fat diet (diet II) according to the American Heart Association.	0.6477235199778731
The study was performed in 37 patients with coronary heart disease (30 males and 7 females, age 45-83 yrs) stratified to the 2 dietary treatments.	0.7942489221751491
Daily fat intake was 38g (24% of energy intake of 6.5MJ/d) in diet I and 60g (31% of 7.3MJ/d) in diet II (p<0.01), respectively.	0.7228897499473009
When compared with dietII, in dietI the intake of cholesterol, saturated and monunsaturated fatty acids, Vit.	0.4668942123724427
B12 were all reduced (p<0.01), whereas the uptake of Vit.	0.5480229089349462
C was increased p<0.01.	0.6117022143126039
The intake of folic acid was low in both groups.	0.36813726822752546
Both diets resulted in a decrease in BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels.	0.4794694854088581
Concomitantly plasma triglycerides only decreased in response to dietI but HDL cholesterol levels remained unchanged.	0.31296922641583297
Reduction of BMI and cholesterol levels were dependent on baseline BMI and cholesterol concentrations, respectively.	0.3929166971793161
The cholesterol lowering effect of diet I is in part attributed to the weight lowering effect of the diet.	0.5355801694010427
Taking into account the nutritional habits in Germany, very low fat diets seem to be adequate with respect to their nutritional value.	0.6056209793012777
Both diets are effective in lowering body weight, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels without affecting HDL cholesterol.	0.36338875342812915
These effects are most pronounced in overweight and hypercholesterolemic patients.	0.3219389610166954
Besides autopsy determined findings of a fibro-fatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium, no assured clinical evidence of arrhythmogenie right ventricular dysplasia-cardiomyopathy (ARVD) exists yet.	0.5985792274482982
Criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AVRD were complied in 1994 by members of the ISFC work group and the European Association for Cardiology.	0.6079671158324477
These criteria include structural, functional, histological, and electrophysiological abnormalities, which were divided into major and minor criteria.	0.7656490925482798
With the successive examination of a collective of 24 patients with a histologically determined diagnosis of ARVD at the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seien, France, the value of the complied criteria were checked.	0.5840599133722503
Global or segmental dilatation of the right ventricle in the sense of major criteria could be proven in 20 patients (83%) using angiography or electrocardiography.	0.734088604271471
Four patients (16%) exhibited only minor criteria in the radionuclear angioscintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disturbances of the right ventricular.	0.580983855894515
In all patients, the typical fibrofatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium could be histologically determined.	0.7972885693093636

A late potential analysis using signal averaged ECG was only present in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in the sense of minor criteria.	0.746985941064039
Left bundle branch block ventricular tachycardia, which was classified as a minor criterion, was observed in 23 patients (96%); only one patient died without proven arrhythmia from rapidly progressing heart failure.	0.7828825249410368
A previous history of unexpected sudden death in family members as a minor criterion arose in 3 of 19 patients (15%).	0.5458554546583892
The complied task force criteria for the diagnosis of AVRD led in all 24 cases to the diagnosis of the disease, whereby the value of a determined histological diagnosis was the gold standard.	0.6690751715900158
Without inclusion of histological data, the clinical diagnosis was determined in only 10 cases.	0.8510714785941371
The question remains whether with a simple division of findings into major and minor criteria a pure clinical diagnosis is possible.	0.4335149624010995

Mean values and medians were calculated to compare the groups for significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation.	0.3789013531448336
Results: A total of 78 patients were recruited in 4 centers, the data have been published in abstractform.	0.7857082850946147
Only 37 patients (verum 18, placebo 19), enrolled in Ratingen were available for detailled efficacy and safety analysis.	0.5275279622421561
All evaluations in these patients were performed by one investigator (G.H.).	0.7537558513806112
There was no subjective, clinical or laboratory parameter showing a significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation.	0.43499934816590974

A 61-year-old woman with depression developed recurring elevated itching erythematous lesions in light-exposed areas after taking St. John's Wort-extract for three years.	0.40609648828773687
Routine patchtesting did not reveal any relevant reactions and photopatch testing was negative.	0.3578502222581433
Using a systemic oral photoprovocation test with St. John's Wort, we were able to demonstrate a decrease of the MED-UVB which was reversible after withdrawal of the medication.	0.5477967563109929
Due to its low solubility and the high maximum concentration delivered by the vaporizer sevoflurane is especially suitable for the performance of low flow anaesthetic techniques.	0.5869867423631603
High flow phases for wash-in or wash-out of anaesthetic gases can be kept short, the difference between the volatile's concentration in the fresh gas and within the breathing system is comparatively small, and the time constants are short even during low flow anaesthesia.	0.7059146417928279
The monitoring, required to sufficiently ensure the safety of the patients, corresponds to the current obliging technical safety standards.	0.5949407424137224
As compound A may accumulate in the breathing system, sevoflurane should not be administered with fresh gas flows lower than 1.0 l/min, until the scientific discussion on nephrotoxicity of this substance in humans is solved.	0.5959758929013119
Low flow anaesthesia guarantees a sufficient and continuous wash-out of trace gases.	0.4910580311733205
Thoroughly the use of sevoflurane with dry soda lime must be avoided, as this volatile in an extreme exothermic reaction is absorbed nearly totally and degraded to a considerable degree by dry carbon dioxide absorbent.	0.48503926624304977
The gaseous degradation products are pungent and possibly may be harmful to the patients.	0.47513905590347805
Only by low flow anaesthesia the use of sevoflurane will gain an economically and ecologically acceptable range of efficiency.	0.4444618894577978
Cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction.	0.5840566049384593
The typical delay from the onset of acute infarction to the development of cardiogenic shock and well defined risk factors allow for an early identification of patients at risk.	0.5346282063171952
Immediate restoration of coronary artery patency by thrombolysis or PTCA can prevent cardiogenic shock in a number of these patients.	0.5170531015235352
Patients presenting with frank cardiogenic shock should be approached with diagnostic vigor in an attempt to identify a treatable lesion.	0.40347046876343756

Object of this review is to present the physiological principles, diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options that are related to modifications of oxygen delivery in sepsis.	0.7233002055865904
Despite intense research activities in this area, many topics regarding oxygen transport and oxygen consumption in sepsis are still not clear.	0.6303797416084455
For example, the often discussed shift of the critical value of oxygen delivery to higher values in sepsis has not been proven, yet.	0.6627452951663599
Beside an impaired regional perfusion also disturbances in the cellular oxygen utilization may be responsible for organ failure in sepsis.	0.5072130319291439
Until now, it was not shown, whether the increase of oxygen delivery to supranormal levels reduces mortality in septic patients.	0.7359995346658752
It is also unknown, which catecholamine and which infusion solution is suitable for the treatment of septic patients.	0.6826554695802263
In future further research is necessary to solve the problems associated with sepsis therapy.	0.5368426300965033
The rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration is a quite involved procedure associated with many potential dangers.	0.6035370014591723
A new nasogastric balloon tube has been developed, which will prevent the reflux of gastric contents by blocking the cardia with a balloon.	0.5277034079419559
It was the aim of this initial study to assess the efficiency of the tube in animals, healthy volunteers and patients.	0.7418489982052386
With the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee, a total of 16 anaesthetised pigs were used for the animal experiments.	0.6595612490948599
Balloon occlusion of the cardia was performed in 10 pigs.	0.7243288018106928
Six further pigs with an unblocked cardia served as controls.	0.24055123411391008
Vomiting and regurgitation was provoked in each animal using six different manoeuvres while the gastro-oesophageal (lower oesophageal) sphincter and intragastric pressures were monitored and the lower oesophagus was continuously inspected using an endoscope.	0.4228254590059488
With local Ethics Committee approval and informed written consent, (1) repeated vomiting was provoked in 16 awake, healthy adult volunteers (10 females, 6 males, 29 +/- 4 years) with a fluid-filled stomach in the presence and in the absence of balloon occlusion of the cardia, while intragastric pressure was monitored, and (2) 30 patients (21 - 89 years) with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration scheduled for abdominal or traumatologic surgery received conventional induction of anesthesia after blocking of the cardia with the balloon.	0.7794690375797664
Pigs (n=10) with a blocked cardia showed no gastrooesophageal reflux during a total of 60 manipulations to provoke vomiting and regurgitation, while 28 of the 36 provoking manipulations induced reflux in pigs (n=6) with an unblocked cardia.	0.6326041799194487
Among the healthy volunteers with a blocked cardia (n=16), reflux of gastric contents was not observed during repeated attempts to stimulate vomiting.	0.5215831392767932
After termination of the occlusion of the cardia, reflux was able to be induced by 14 of the 16 volunteers.	0.6131094307758435
In 30 patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration the cardia was blocked and anaesthesia was induced using a mask and manual ventilation without encountering any problems.	0.5949832287086495
The average time from loss of consciousness to tracheal intubation was 164 +/- 8 s. Conclusions.	0.6154868971596303
It is concluded from the present results, with further clinical studies pending, that the gastric balloon probe permits low-risk conventional induction sequence of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk for pulmonary aspiration and that the device may also be safely used during the extubation phase.	0.8040378717799025
The article explains the cognitive psychoanalytic theory of psychotherapy developed by Weiss and discusses the theory in the field between psychoanalytic and cognitive-behavioristic theories and therapeutic techniques.	0.4882883663934097
The basic assumption is: pathogenic beliefs that are based on traumatic childhood experiences prevent normal desirable goals.	0.3863099587502753
Patients are unconsciously motivated to overcome pathogenic beliefs.	0.234673766877911
In psychotherapy, the patient works to disprove pathogenic beliefs by testing them in the relationship with the therapist.	0.6653434852859518
In this way patients achieve corrective emotional experiences.	0.5103537100320417
The theory is supported by numerous empirical studies.	0.3467897986827194
Treatment with "nootropic drugs" of patients suffering from dementia is often described as arbitrary.	0.6525884931035715
To define the potential usefulness of nootropic drugs, effects and side effects, economic aspects in comparison to other treatment approaches were studied.	0.579079623197413
A summary of literature published concerning these criteria underlines the efficacy of nootropics in improving the symptoms at the beginning and in postponing the progress of the disease.	0.5193286659408698
The majority of substances does not lead to severe side effects.	0.4548411347134283
There are not enough studies comparing the effects of the substances or on prophylactic effects.	0.6099776556117915
Delayed admission to care units leads to a positi- ve cost effect of nootropics.	0.3992339542947132
Thus, also for economic reasons it seems advisable to treat patients with nootropics.	0.5899150191569585
Better effects are gained when nootropic treatment is combined with training and changing of the structure of the environment.	0.5034780162629294
A proposal for a rational treatment with nootropics is derived from the data.	0.4285707431959951

Simulation has gained an important role in medical education and continuing education in the field of anaesthesia and emergency medicine.	0.616202985102629
This article gives background information on how full-scale simulators are applied in medical education as well as in continuing education for advanced anesthesia and scientific applications.	0.5679735674743178
Acceptance of training seems enhanced by inclusion of the human factor aspect, since this has proven  to be a major source for the development of critical situations in our specialty.	0.7131844266469406
Furthermore, drawbacks of the simulators available and the current training availability in Germany is described.	0.4749297061456182
We evaluated changes in brain tissue oxygen pressure (ptiO2) and global cerebral blood flow (CBF) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) in ten anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits (body weight 2.5 +/- 0.5 kg).	0.6323940958125548
CBF [hydrogen desaturation (clearance)-technique) and ptiO2 (Licox-microsensor) right frontoparietal cortex] were determined.	0.5575617702831256
After median sternotomy, the animals were placed on CPB (standard roller pump, nonpulsatile, -stat acid-base management, perfusion flow of 180-200 mL/kg/min, right atrial and aortic cannulation) for induction of DHCA by cooling to 15 °C rectal temperature (1 °C per minute).	0.631286395727504
Rewarming period was started after 60 minutes of circulatory arrest and the rabbits were weaned from CPB without the use of any inotropic or vasoactive support.	0.43667303637549615
Under baseline conditions, ptiO2 was 38 +/- 5 mmHg and did not change significantly before DHCA.	0.5026692824430644
During DHCA the ptiO2 decreased within 15 minutes to 14 +/- 5 mmHg, after 30 minutes to 5 +/- 1 mmHg and after 40 minutes to zero.	0.5860275410843857
Neither the ptiO2 nor CBF recovered fully following restoration of bypass flow and reperfusion: ptiO2 (25 +/- 4 mmHg vs. baseline: 38 +/- 5 mmHg, p<0.05) and CBF (43 +/- 8 vs. baseline: 68 +/- 11 ml/100 g/min, p<0.05) were significantly reduced.	0.6661625078104287
Arterial and jugular-venous lactate levels increased after rewarming (p<0.05) and corresponded to the appearance of a anaerobic metabolism.	0.5242105425869706
These data demonstrate significantly decreased levels of ptiO2 (brain tissue oxygenation) and CBF (oxygen supply) during and after rewarming from DHCA.	0.5723507259429401
The induced impairment of recovery persists after rewarming and generates a temporary low-flow situation with delayed brain tissue reoxygenation on the cellular/mitochondrial level.	0.46043965908992657
Thus, a direct influence on brain functional recovery by the active cooling and rewarming process about the bloodstream during CPB, resulting in disturbed tissue blood redistribution, mitochondrial dysfunction and/or excessive cerebral oxygen consumption (compensation of an oxygen debt) is a possible explanation.	0.5904160410180921
While initially advocated primarily for intrasurgical visualization (e. g., craniotomy), interventional MRI rapidly evolved into roles in image-guided localization for needle-based procedures, minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures, and thermal ablation of cancer.	0.44857824551772235
In this contest, MRI pulse sequences and scanning methods serve one of four primary roles: (1) speed improvement, (2) device localization, (3) anatomy/lesion differentiation and (4) temperature sensitivity.	0.6153273401648571

This review summarizes vascular tumours of skin and soft tissues that have been characterised in recent years.	0.6458671280688929
Although most of them are very rare, knowledge about their reproducible clinicopathological features is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls.	0.6987976745587037
These lesions include: bacillary angiomatosis, a vasoproliferative, pseudoneoplastic infection of immunocompromised patients caused by Rochalimaea henselae; tufted angioma, a variant of lobular capillary haemangioma characterised by a "cannon-ball" distribution of multiple lobules composed of packed capillaries and pericytes; microvenular haemangioma, a cutaneous haemangioma composed of thin-walled and irregularly branching blood vessels which dissect dermal collagen; sinusoidal haemangioma, a distinctive variant of cavernous haemangioma which may be located in the subcutaneous breast tissue and then may be confused with well-differentiated angiosarcoma; "hobnail haemangioma" (targetoid haemosiderotic haemangioma), a benign vascular tumour with a distinctive clinical targetoid appearance and a hobnail cytomorphology of the prominent endothelial tumour cells; retiform haemangioendothelioma, a very recently characterised low-grade angiosarcoma occurring most commonly in the extremities of adolescents which is characterised by arborising blood vessels arranged in a retiform pattern and lined by hobnail-like prominent endothelial cells; Kaposi-like infantile haemangioendothelioma, a borderline malignant tumour of infants mimicking Kaposi's sarcoma histologically; epithelioid angiosarcoma, a highly aggressive tumour in the spectrum of epithelioid vascular lesions which stains positively for endothelial and epithelial immunohistological markers; benign lymph-angioendothelioma (progressive lymphangioma), a benign, slowly growing macule or plaque which has to be distinguished from well-differentiated angiosarcoma and Kaposi's sarcoma; and lymphangiomatosis of the limbs, a poorly recognised angiomatosis occurring in young patients and limited mainly to the limbs with a favourable prognosis.	0.5342007184904412

Experimental animal models of ventricular arrhythmias have been developed to investigate the mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in man.	0.7752213223371665
Ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischaemia and infarction often cannot be elucidated by clinical studies on patients because those arrhythmias are potentially lifethreatening and their occurrence is unpredictable.	0.48504540378301847
Because of additional experimental procedures and techniques that can be used in the animal laboratory, such as microelectrode recording of transmembrane action potentials and high-density optical and electrical activation mapping, animal models have provided information that cannot be obtained from clinical studies.	0.6490532681748314
Studies on animal models have provided new ideas and hypotheses that have been tested in clinical studies and that have been found to be true for clinical arrhythmias.	0.7260913088147535
Animal models have enabled the mechanisms of fibrillation and defibrillation to be understood and new therapeutic concepts to be developed.	0.5862091514096778
The purpose of this article is to briefly review some animal models of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.	0.6230252554334809
Some contributions that these animal studies have made to our understanding of ventricular tachyarrhythmias will be discussed.	0.5024383981518984
Because of the clinical importance of coronary artery disease this article concentrates on those arrhythmias caused by myocardial ischaemia and infarction.	0.7106540392407145
The authors report a rare, recently diagnosed and atypical mishap during one-lung ventilation (OLV) via a double lumen tube (DLT) and left-sided thoracotomy: an ipsilateral pneumothorax during ventilation of the right lung.	0.663314247252965
This occurred in a 63-year-old patient with chronic obstructive airway disease who was scheduled for urgent repair of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.	0.5938574478653137
Anaesthesia and surgery were uneventful until aortic cross-clamping release.	0.4468849907126873
The common presentation of increased intrathoracic extrapleural pressure owing to a pneumothorax in patients with mechanically ventilated lungs is a rapid decrease in oxygen saturation, followed or paralleled by haemodynamic deterioration.	0.5117123240315986
Although the above presentation could be seen in this case, the diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax was delayed twice.	0.8132422548061303
First, symptoms were initially obscured by haemodynamic changes resulting from a head-down tilt and aortic declamping.	0.49882653090699014
Second, since the lack of consolidation after aortic declamping focused attention on the airway problems, complications resulting from the use of a DLT were primarily considered.	0.7021433951745992
In particular, since breathing sounds were detectable initially, malposition or torsion of the DLT had to be excluded by fibre-optic bronchoscopy, which involved a further delay.	0.5678270062855253
Finally, two observations led to the diagnosis of a right-sided tension pneumothorax: (1) bullae of the contralateral lung, detected during thoracotomy; (2) the finding that ventilation of both lungs and the left lung subsequently increased arterial (SaO2) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and the circulatory status, but ventilation of the right lung caused a deterioration.	0.7955280634787385
Chest radiography and insertion of a chest tube with drainage of air, thereafter, validated our hypothesis.	0.43729620164398353
The time course of oxygen desaturation during OLV and tension pneumothorax was as severe as expected; the time course of haemodynamic deterioration, however, appeared quicker and had more impact than expected.	0.5075449106270928
Assuming that mediastinal deviation was not hindered by contralateral intrathoracic pressure during thoracotomy, we believed that circulation should be depressed later or to a lesser extent in patients with an intraoperative pneumothorax.	0.577662845826223
Yet, during thoracotomy, decrease in cardiac filling and output during tension pneumothorax in OLV obviously results primarily from the immovability of the mediastinum owing to mediastinal fixation and is at least as decisive as the contralateral intrathoracic pressure in closed-chest patients.	0.5413115596981878
In summary, a tension pneumothorax during one-lung ventilation and thoracotomy is a rare, but disastrous complication during the use of a DLT, which has not, to our knowledge, been reported previously.	0.7795718893078518
We recommend that tension pneumothorax be added to the list of complications and problems during OLV by the use of a DLT, especially in patients with structural lung diseases.	0.6825622119132502

Introduction: The goal of this study was to compare contrast-enhanced T1-weighted Flash and Turbo-Flash sequences with conventional spin-echo sequences as a basis for planning high-precision radiotherapy.	0.587197349279673
Methods: A total of 25 consecutive patients with different intracranial tumors and a disrupted blood-brain barrier were studied.	0.6019625507551342
T1-weighted Flash, Turbo-Flash and conventional spin-echo images were evaluated after controlled 30-s infusion of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight of Gd-DTPA.	0.5462237120764177
The evaluation of the three sequences included the measurement of the signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios, the visual inspection of the tumors and artifacts, and the measurement of tumor size.	0.8461166085161487
Results: The signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly (P < 0.05-0.01) lower for Flash and Turbo-Flash than for conventional spin-echo sequences.	0.6266853450004751
However, visual inspection of the contrast-enhancing tumors revealed in 23 and 24 of 25 lesions on Flash and Tu-rbo-Flash images, respectively, good or very good tumor visibility when compared with conventional spin-echo images with a reduction of imaging time by a factor of 7-8.	0.6122073388202985
Flash and Turbo-Flash sequences were more prone to susceptibility artifacts, conventional spin-echo sequences more to pulsation artifacts in the posterior fossa.	0.4709221713187955
Tumor sizes were comparable in all three techniques.	0.5786027068105618
Conclusion: At present, conventional spin-echo images are superior to fast Flash and ultrafast Turbo-Flash sequences as a basis for accurate target volume definition in high-precision radiotherapy.	0.5208552585922763
However, fast Flash and Turbo-Flash images may be a practicable alternative to conventional spin-echo images for tumors in the posterior fossa or in patients unable to tolerate a stereotactic fixation device.	0.5881105892607631
Despite some limitations, Turbo-Flash sequences enable fast dynamic MR imaging combined with an acceptable morphology, which may be sufficient for target volume planning in high-precision radiotherapy.	0.6223764775263373

Forty patients suffering from idiopathic PD were interviewed at an office of neurological specialists and at an outpatient movement disorder clinic about their use of health care resources 3 months prior to the study.	0.5379643900412905
The total annual costs reported were DM 14,500, consisting of DM 6500 for drug therapy and DM 8000 for other medical services, including hospital inpatient care (DM 5600), outpatient care (DM 700), medical sundries (DM 1100) and physiotherapy (DM 600).	0.5909763023916146
The costs were positively correlated to the extent of the disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage; HY) and the occurrence of motor fluctuations/dyskinesias.We found that both drug-therapy expenses and total medical costs doubled from HYI to HYIV.	0.5827049198094043
The rarely employed s.c. therapy with apomorphine additionally increased the costs of drug therapy in HYV.	0.5347289269222726
The occurrence of fluctuations/ dyskinesias also increased medical expenses by approximately a factor of two.	0.318618568811537
Indirect burden due to increased days off of work, unemployment and earlier retirement are also significant in Parkinson's disease.	0.37119671780020624
This study oncludes that a treatment which could prevent or retard disease progression as well as a treatment that delays or reduces motor complications would not only ameliorate the situation of patients suffering from PD, but would also lead to significant reductions in cost for the national health care system.	0.5320548889634327
The cryopreservation of human ovarian tissue is essentially intended to maintain fertility and endocrinological function in female cancer patients and female patients at increased risk of early menopause.	0.46855685344574427
After having been frozen and subsequently thawed, the tissue can, ideally, be transplanted to its original site, where it leads to spontaneous fertilisation.	0.5822071465585179
Heterotopic transplantations are also discussed as autografts or xenotransplants in SCID mice.	0.3236428225323593
In addition to the use of whole tissue, the isolation of individual follicles and their in vitro maturation (IVM) are discussed.	0.7210493345752097
As in the case of heterotopic transplantation of ovarian tissue, pregnancy can only be achieved in these cases by in vitro fertilisation of the matured oocytes.	0.7110994254052571
Although considerable progress has already been made in both directions, these are still, at the present time, experimental processes that require further in-depth investigation prior to widespread clinical application.	0.6124883159313048
In addition to its use following the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, IVM of immature oocytes also plays a significant role in promoting current methods of assisted reproduction.	0.4947553587334646
The successful maturation of immature oocytes could lead to improved assessment of the oocytes obtained by follicular puncture and to a reduction in the incidence and risk of ovarian stimulation.	0.7148805882665334
IVM is therefore expected to broaden the spectrum of individual treatment regimens as in the case of PCOS patients, for instance, increasing treatment efficacy by the additional acquisition of immature oocytes or by "rescuing" IVF cycles with unintentionally immature oocytes.	0.5559707660254666
Background: Transconjunctival peribulbar anesthesia is reported to permit better identification of the bulbar limits because of a better view into the fornix; it is also said to be less painful compared to transcutaneous peribulbar anesthesia.	0.6199947511861007
The aim of our study was to compare the two injection techniques.	0.6282827665039902
The German Registry for Hearing Loss in Children (DZH) processes nationwide data from audiological centers.	0.3852381877540241
Coping with the accrued data and its subsequent management and analysis requires a high degree of security and control.	0.49276281713147513
To establish a nationwide registry it is necessary at an early stage to take into consideration the legal requirements of the participating states.	0.7069688332563563
Use of the DZH as an example demonstrates how a pragmatic solution can be reached.	0.5979281000357528
Special issues concerning data collection, transfer, storage and deletion, coding strategies to ensure anonymity, checking for duplicate entries, data separation, and automated data analysis and data protection are explained.	0.4243218919304231
Cardiac fibroblasts are known to have high affinity corticoid receptors for aldosterone and account for the accumulation of collagen within the interstitium of the rat myocardium in acquired and genetic hypertension.	0.4717599181624891
This interstitial fibrosis is an important determinant of pathologic hypertrophy in chronic heart failure.	0.48570683144367466
The social environment in which obstetrics is offered today is characterized by a mentality of weariness: weariness by affluence, ignorance and by misunderstanding.	0.37524507662844453
As a final result an unscientific era comes about, on which Karl Jaspers commented in 1945 that only this unscientific spirit had made National Socialism possible.	0.4148415428231509
Based on the good statistical results of German obstetrics compared to those of foreign countries, it is shown that our patients' demands for "gentle" obstetrics can be combined with the requirements of safe obstetrics.	0.6543424305139791
If the professional interests of doctors and midwives are joint together, "safe and gentle" obstetrics should result in the common goal of a healthy child and a happy mother.	0.5972506561576281
Objectives: Due to its unique pharmacokinetics, the new esterase-metabolised opioid remifentanil results in rapid post-anaesthesia recovery.	0.5409744498424327
The aim of this clinical investigation was to compare recovery times after remifentanil anaesthesia in combination with hypnotic concentrations of either propofol or isoflurane.	0.6736938407788129
Dosages used in the study protocol were based on recommendations by the pharmaceutical manufacturer.	0.7029981086123915
Methods: Patients (ASA status I-II) scheduled for elective arthroscopy were included in this trial.	0.6620034629860546
Without premedication in the morning, anaesthesia was induced identically in both groups: remifentanil bolus (1 µg/kg), start of remifentanil-infusion (0.5 µg/kg/min), followed immediately by propofol (ca.	0.677720507705553
For maintenance of anaesthesia remifentanil (0.25 µg/kg/min) was combined with either a propofol infusion of 0.1 mg/kg/min or 0.5 MAC isoflurane (=0.6 vol.%) in O2/air.	0.7306736269074446
Anaesthetic delivery was discontinued simultaneously with termination of surgery and recovery times were recorded.	0.4855761226106978
Results: A total of 40 patients were studied at random in two groups of 20 each with comparable demographic data and anaesthetic technique (Tables 1 and 2).	0.6533668434861388
In both groups emergence was very rapid.	0.5730548771495282
Recovery times were significantly shorter for remifentanil-isoflurane than for remifentanil-propofol (Table 3): spontaneous ventilation 5.1 vs 8.1 min (P<0.05), extubation 5.5 vs. 8.6 min (P<0.02), post-anaesthesia recovery score >=9 of 10 points 6.2 vs 11.3 min (P<0.01), and arrival at PACU 16.2 vs 19.2 min (P<0.01).	0.6532954201544432
Mild to moderate shivering was noted in 40% of all patients (9 cases following isoflurane, 7 following propofol).	0.7706245457873865
Conclusions: Using the manufacturer's recommended dosages, emergence after remifentanil anaesthesia is more rapid with 0.5 MAC isoflurane than with 0.1 mg/kg/min propofol.	0.7087154027001641
These results are most probably due to the different pharmacological properties of both co-anaesthetics, especially the applied dosages, and to different interactions with remifentanil.	0.8507063380573809
Present clinical experience suggests that a further dose reduction, especially for propofol, is possible.	0.8107517796950903
For both remifentanil groups emergence was remarkably rapid between return of consciousness and the awake state (on-off phenomenon), which might contribute to post-anaesthesia safety.	0.5983456660075859
Exposure of the skin to ultraviolet irradiation is an important risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma, with UVA possibly playing an important role.	0.8701340516637132
Hereditary factors are also relevant.	0.2914782121616582
In the dysplastic nevus syndrome a genetic instability has been shown by different methods.	0.5735528930414728
In xeroderma pigmentosum the DNA repair defect is thought to be responsible for the high incidence of malignant melanoma.	0.544150222405454
Frequent and non-random changes in certain chromosomes have been demonstrated in melanoma cells.	0.46940519883752174
These might contain sequences that control melanoma growth or melanoma suppressor genes.	0.23255079208196383
Especially the short arm of chromosome 9 is thought to contain one of these genes.	0.6114416429050744
This hypothesis is supported by a genetic linkage analysis in melanoma families and the demonstration of a germ line deletion of the locus 9p21 in a patient with eight primary melanomas.	0.6324524476820157
Changes in known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes have also been reported in melanoma, but no consistent sequence of genetic events is known.	0.6594208755422094
Neuropsychological studies could demonstrate increased risk for impaired attention and short term memory as well as a general reduced information processing speed in childhood's epilepsy.	0.5248931830102572
Up to now it is not totally understood if focal EEG-pathology represents a specific cognitive deficit strongly related to the corresponding hemisphere's functions or represents a less lateralized but more general cognitive deficit of both cerebral hemispheres.	0.5366912623787528
In a sample of 44 pediatric patients with epilepsy we studied sequential and simultaneous cognitive information processing.	0.3686935002427456
As a major result a general decreased function in cognitive information processing (more sequential than simultaneous) has been found.	0.5569887373563333
There was no correlation with the localization of an EEG-Focus nor with the hand preference.	0.6169625663665036
According to previous studies patients with an increased number of medical drugs or with presence of neuroradiological lesions are at greatest risk for cognitive impairment.	0.5530353869169766
Our data indicate a possible affection of underlying metamemory functions.	0.35946621691129277
The aim of this prospective and randomized study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reduced shock strength in transvenous implantable defibrillator therapy.	0.7481037685368517
So far clinical data concerning the safety margin of the shock energy in ICD therapy do not exist.	0.49277587263129885
The shock energy tested during long-term follow-up in this study was twice the intraoperatively measured defibrillation threshold (DFT).	0.672525008375249
A total number of 176 consecutive patients representing a typical cohort of ICD patients were evaluated.	0.49515984964883514
All patients received a non-thoracotomy lead system (CPI, Endotak 0070, 0090) and a biphasic cardioverter-defibrillator with the ability to store episodes (Cardiac Pacemakers Inc., Ventac TM PRx II, PRx III).	0.5473259928511276
The intraoperative defibrillation threshold (DFT) was evaluated in a step-down protocol (15, 10, 8, 5 J) and hat to be <=15 J for inclusion into the study.	0.7750287380940591
The lowest effective energy terminating induced ventricular fibrillation had to be confirmed and was defined as DFT+ augmented defibrillation threshold.	0.5101197286327666
The DFT+ value was tested immediately after successful implantation, at discharge, and after a follow-up period of one year.	0.8282845465735886
Prior to implantation the patients were randomized into two groups.	0.6553450390131178
The energy of the first shock in the study group was programmed at twice DFT+ and in the control group at the maximum energy output (34 J).	0.8084770761715553
The efficacy of the first shock and its reproducibility in DFT testings and in spontaneous episodes during long-term follow-up of the study group were compared to those in the control group.	0.8830623981521543
A DFT+ value was found to be <=15 J in 166 of 176 patients (94%).	0.4477114237440544
The DFT+ in the study group was 9.6+/-3.2; in control group 10.1+/-.35 J.	0.7357859304936498
The prohability of successful defibrillation at DFT+ level after one year was 84%.	0.32385530735662094
The success rate of the first shock meant to terminate induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 99.5% in the study group (217 of 218 episodes) and 99% in the control group (201 of 203 episodes).	0.8145049816578912
During follow-up of 24+/-9 months spontaneous episodes in the study group, 83/86 (96.5) monomorphic ventricular tachycardias (MVT) and 38/40 (95%) VF-episodes were converted successfully by the 2x DFT+ shock.	0.6739102786193247
In the control group the first shock was successful in 151/156 (96.8%) spontaneous MVTs and in 30/33 (91%) VF episodes.	0.7031059236829423
The efficacy of the first shock was not influenced by clinical data such as the underlying cardiac disease, left ventricular function, ongoing antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone, or the number of spontaneous episodes per day or by the DFT itself.	0.7893724099030542
At a mean follow-up of two years there was no significant difference between the two groups concerning the incidence of sudden cardiac death (2.4% in the study group vs. 3.8% in the control group).	0.9867773843398818
In conclusion programming the first shock with the ICD lead system used in this study at 2x DFT+ is as efficient as a shock energy of 34 J in order to terminate induced and spontaneous episodes of VT/VF.	0.5575452859844803
Thus, the safety of ICD-therapy is not impaired when programming the shock energy at the 2x DFT+ value.	0.6662503610880052
Culpable deficits of the preoperative information cause a complete illegality of the whole medical intervention and lead to liability for any resulting damage.	0.5589481847393108
In cases of controversy it's the physician's due to prove the correct preoperative information.	0.5567050259793325
To reduce these liability-risks a computer based information system has been developed.	0.47959945983865726
With its help an working sheet is provided which is individually adjusted for the patient.	0.3469940349370497
Based upon this record the real preoperative information takes place.	0.31486505697163697
After the patient signed the record the physician keeps it at his disposal for proving the contents of the preoperative information.	0.47271848992143645
The conception's use over many years shows that overlooking essential aspects and misunderstanding can grossly be excluded for the patient and a high quality of information can be reached.	0.6278884084652091
In vitro culture of peritoneal explants of neonatal rats after previous application of agents simulating wound antisepsis is a sensitive screening method for the determination of the tissue compatibility of local wound antiinfectives.	0.5667683450246137
Two test models are differentiated: (1) separated peritoneal explants as a model for chronic or deep wounds and (2) peritoneum in situ in the experimental animal with subsequent extraction and cultivation of the explants.	0.5093367187932514
Considering the present state of knowledge the following conclusions can be drawn regarding antisepsis of wounds: Lavasept (0.1 %) may be classified as the agent of choice for deep and chronic wounds, for drip-suck irrigation and for antiinfective lavage of body cavities inclusively for peritoneal lavage (0,05 %).	0.653216185091666
Taurolidin is antiseptically effective in long term application ( > 6 h), and because of its antitoxic effect as well as lack of cytotoxicity it is especially suitable for peritoneal lavage.	0.6720802137690498
Betaisodona solution is very well suited for superficial contaminated wounds and can be used in a dilution of 1 : 10 for short-term rinsing of deep wounds, including body cavities but not for peritoneal lavage.	0.7402463513376514
Ethanol causes no inhibition of explant growth and therefore retains its importance in wound antisepsis.	0.35855942902899485

Death may occur while a fleeing or resisting suspect is taken into custody by the police.	0.3483144413144912
We report about this type of acute death in two males.	0.6262468967303777
In both cases, a cocaine intoxication was taken as the cause of death despite an initial suspicion of a direct association between the death and police measures (e.g.	0.580998675615169
neck compression or "headlock", chest compression).	0.45527590043180904
From the Institute's autopsy material we selected another 12 cases with monointoxication by cocaine as the cause of death of as a secondary finding for comparison.	0.44136267445839605
Of the 12 cases 5 were gunshot injuries and 4 were classified as suicide.	0.45622465691551967
The analysis suggested an increased willingness to apply force against themselves or others under the influence of cocaine.	0.33647507009452565
In both cases, cardiac arrest occurred suddenly and unexpectedly for all those involved and who were unaware of any acute life-threatening situation because of the extreme attempts of the suspects to flee or resist arrest.	0.5356956567206433
Attention should be given to these types of cases during the training of police officers.	0.5509693898635307

Non-traumatic duodenocaval fistulae are rare, but may be the source of massive gastrointestional bleeding with associated fever and sepsis.	0.6537570814291837
These fistulae result from penetrating duodenal peptic ulcers or right nephrectomy and subsequent radiation to the upper abdomen.	0.36659040342881444
The outcome depends on early diagnosis and surgery before a potentially fatal hemorrhage occurs.	0.5228318502120014
The therapy of choice includes closure of the fistula and repair of the duodenum and inferior vena cava.	0.6260326375824432

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is rare but beset with a high mortality rate.	0.6234253714746518
In recent years, however, a trend towards higher survival rates has been observed.	0.5085690380395728
High inspiratory oxygen concentrations, large tidal volumes, and high peak inspiratory airway pressures applied during mechanical ventilation have been identified as harmful to the lung and can contribute to the progression of ARDS.	0.6722749034290809
This had led to reconsideration of the sequelae of ventilatory therapy.	0.32179718418620384
Mechanical ventilation and other adjunctive strategies in ARDS have changed from the conventional approach aiming at normalisation of physiological ventilatory parameters to an elaborated approach that intends to protect the ventilated lung, prevent oxygen toxicity, recruit the infiltrated atelectatic and consolidated lung and reduce the anatomical and alveolar dead space.	0.4333094446566374
This new approach consists of various forms of pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation with PEEP and permissive hypercapnia, body position changes, and inhalation of nitric oxide.	0.5801630659801194
Should these procedures fail to improve impaired gas exchange, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an additional therapeutic option.	0.42449904854934317

Almost 20% of all patients cannot be completely examined by transthoracic echocardiography.	0.7242796678981037
In this patient group, MRI can be used as a second line technique to provide important diagnostic information not obtainable by echocardiography.	0.6892463995540115
However, there are clinical problems for which MRI may be used as the first line technique such as complex congenital heart disease, diseases of the great vessels, pericardial disease or cardiac tumors.	0.8062872162761406
MRI is undergoing rapid technical improvement and this will further improve the diagnostic utility of the technique, especially in patients with coronary artery disease.	0.6181931111805021

The clinical and histopathological findings were consistent with solid persistent erythema and edema of the face associated with rosacea and lymph vessel dysplasia.	0.641928585232997
The chronic course, absence of serological abnormalities and nonspecific histopathological features as well as resistance to therapy are the most important diagnostic cirteria of this disease also known as Morbihan's disease.	0.6787314976677293
The cervical spine is an extremely complex functional unit and has always been the subject of impassioned discussions among surgeons, orthopedic specialists and neurologists.	0.5610523241681912
In the presence of injuries affecting this section of the spine, which sometimes have grave consequences - including implications for legal insurance aspects, neurologists are usually at the end of the line when it comes to diagnosis and treatment.	0.6165894197385946
In fact, in view of the clinical and technical neurophysiological options available to neurologists, it would be desirable for them to be involved as early as possible.	0.7759738724368013
In this paper the relative value of neurology, compared with orthopedics and surgery, in the diagnosis and treatment of whiplash injury to the cervical spine is discussed.	0.8611571794784265

The confusion of scientific, economic, juridical and professional contexts is the reason for the present uneasiness within therapeutic culture.	0.523987985598863
The author pleads for autonomy of these contexts to defend the profession reasonably against powerful overdetermination by other contexts.	0.30219926806018976
The debate about EST ("empirically supported therapy") is being drawn upon to show that the list of criteria for differentiation of effective and ineffective therapies is not warranted.	0.6429860733047293
Scientific or economic dominance claims might have deteriorating effects in the professional fields, as well-known researchers meanwhile fear.	0.6383279333165792
In economic contexts the aim is efficiency, in professional contexts it is quality.	0.5782254778907522
To develop own quality measures has the aim to promote the profession as a learning organization.	0.4176717273574504
This could help to rise professionals' self-confidence.	0.29668254147388484
Procalcitonin is the propeptide of calcitonin devoid of hormonal activity.	0.28197866294044005
Normally, procalcitonin is produced in the C-cells of the thyroid gland.	0.42141449981924695
In healthy humans procalcitonin levels are undetectable (<0.1 ng/ml).	0.6899910655707814
During severe generalized infections (bacterial, parasitic and fungal) with systemic manifestations, procalcitonin levels may rise up to 100 ng/ml.	0.5932451712507731
In contrast, severe viral infections or inflammatory reactions of non-infectious origin do not or very moderately increase procalcitonin levels.	0.568870834368893
The exact site of procalcitonin production is not exactly known but even large amounts of procalcitonin released during infections do not lead to an increase in plasma calcitonin level or activity.	0.46102960741752774
In this retrospective study, oncologic and functional results of 24 patients treated for glomus jugulare tumor stages C and D are reported.	0.5990158028733397
The surgical approach used was a combined transmastoid-transcervical approach, which was modified according to individual tumor growth.	0.7025503603337335
As needed, this was combined with a transtemporal or retrosigmoid approach.	0.6958080233412615
Complete tumor removal resulted in a cure rate of 100%.	0.5252508689141778
Surgically induced cranial nerve palsies developed in 38% of the patients.	0.5162594416734407

Electron beam CT, which does not require mechanical movement of an X-ray tube, has a temporal resolution which exceeds that of conventional computed tomography by a factor of about ten.	0.6553773312445275
Axial images of the heart can be acquired within 50 to 100 ms with a spatial resolution below 0.5 mm2 and permit precise visualization of all cardiac structures.	0.5736323318768461
ECG-triggered acquisition of 30 to 40 axial images (3 mm slice thickness) in a short inspiratory breathhold allows one to sample a 3-dimensional volume data set which covers the complete heart.	0.6661951338621281
Overall acquisition times are approximately 30 to 50 seconds.	0.3046710109919816
While electron beam CT in general permits a complete cardiac investigation, including morphology, function, and perfusion, the method's most important application is non-invasive imaging of the coronary arteries.	0.7064704489846244
Without contrast enhancement, coronary calcification by EBCT currently constitutes the most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence even of very early forms of coronary atherosclerosis.	0.5428027642134888
Intraveneous injection of contrast agent during image acquisition additionally permits the selective visualization of the coronary artery lumen and detection of significant stenoses.	0.5484353802098814
This method is especially well suited in the follow-up of coronary interventions and coronary bypass grafting.	0.6396653715411436
Breathhold and movement artifacts, superposition of coronary arteries and veins, as well as severe coronary calcifications currently constitute the method's main problems.	0.48888514337086886
In spite of these limitations, electron beam CT has been shown to permit clinically valuable non-invasive investigations of the coronary arteries, which may be further refined as technology progresses.	0.7018203436236614
Despite the availability of diagnostic modalities such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging up to 30% of patients with acute aortic dissection remain undiagnosed before death.	0.6293521798423403
A novel immunoassay of serum smooth muscle myosin as a potential diagnostic tool for the detection of aortic dissection.	0.5696106390592476
The immunoassay was applied in two patients with an acute chest pain syndrome but no initial suspicion of aortic disease.	0.7340539149799253
In both patients myocardial ischemia was ruled out by laboratory, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examination.	0.48861429828247926
In the first patient both dilation of the aortas and long-standing arterial hypertension were known; however, it was not before 48h until dissection was suspected and a spiral-CT was performed demonstrating a localized ascending aortic dissection.	0.665399933344897
At this time (48 h after onset of symptoms) the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain concentration in the serum was close to normal.	0.7186020815356394
In the other patient there was neither a suggestive history nor any clinical sign of aortic dissection.	0.5362393212842971
Widening of the abdominal was the key to the incidental diagnosis of a clinically unsuspected type B dissection.	0.6603803236858397
The serum test 12 h after onset of pain revealed elevated (diagnostic) serum levels of smooth muscle myosin heavy chains.	0.48432618525919396
Recurrent abdominal pain is found in 10-25% of school-aged children, thus being one of the most frequent complaints in childhood.	0.7569688477229988
Despite that, our knowledge about this syndrome is still very incomplete.	0.6690517639570962
Following oral surgery, there are sometimes disturbances in wound healing.	0.6450321100631656
It was the aim of this investigation to look for relationships between the composition of saliva and disturbed wound healing.	0.6062092393368463
Resting as well as stimulated fasting whole saliva was collected from 96 patients (19 to 53 years of age) prior to oral surgery.	0.5452504311866178
Flow rate, pH, standard bicarbonate, total buffer bases, peroxidase, lysozyme, thiocyanate, secretory immunoglobulin A, lactoferrin, total protein, tissue type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor were determined.	0.5190118897111935
The salivary data of eight patients who suffered from disturbed wound healing were compared to the data of 20 randomly selected patients with normal wound healing.	0.738184846343067
Patients with disturbed wound healing revealed increased activities and secretion rates for peroxidase in resting saliva.	0.34973113985225934
In stimulated saliva, decreased secretion rates for thiocyanate and total protein were found.	0.39915963195057497
Not a single salivary factor was able to discriminate both groups of patients with sufficient accuracy, but with a combination of tissue type plasminogen activator, peroxidase, plus secretory immunoglobulin A measurements from resting whole saliva a clearly improved and acceptable discrimination of the two patient groups was possible.	0.572620667615794
A discriminant function including six salivary factors could be used to completely separate both groups.	0.4531527387965955
Nuclear imaging methods provide noninvasive indexes of myocardial function, perfusion, and metabolism and are well accepted in clinical cardiology.	0.6247237206883959
Advances in prevention and treatment of cardiac disease have resulted in decreasing cardiovascular mortality in industrialized nations.	0.5298132638069644
The improvement in therapeutic options has increased the demand for diagnostic tests that might guide clinical decision making.	0.4532502115159203
Information beyond the pure anatomic characterization of coronary stenoses is required.	0.36596458254562986
Nuclear imaging can be used for early detection and monitoring of the severity and extent of disease.	0.8870695258157792
The prognostic potential of such functional testing is being increasingly appreciated and used to guide therapy, thereby resulting in improvement of the quality and cost-effectiveness of the workup of patients with cardiovascular disease.	0.7556544150298614
Extensive clinical validation has resulted in growing acceptance of these techniques.	0.5060050746287558
Furthermore, ongoing improvement of imaging techniques and development of new radiopharmaceuticals will pave the way for disease-specific, molecular-targeted cardiac imaging in the future.	0.6593331669172826
Epidural anaesthesia for elective caesarean section can have advantages over general anaesthesia.	0.37980142753545115
The anaesthesiologist can avoid endotracheal intubation as well as fetal depression following placental transfer of systemic anaesthetics.	0.3994216501351281
However, despite reaching an effective blockade preoperatively, intraoperative discomfort and pain may occur during epidural anaesthesia with local anaesthetics alone, necessitating supplemental systemic analgesics or even conversion to general anaesthesia [21].	0.5699119001458826
Addition of epidural fentanyl has been shown to improve onset and quality of perioperative analgesia without evident side effects for mother or newborn [24].	0.5029506317508544
Nevertheless, administration of epidural opioids before cord clamping is still hotly debated, some fearing maternal and or neonatal depression [6, 26].	0.5687447485813081
The aim of the present study was to investigate the quality of analgesia, associated side effects and the resulting maternal and neonatal plasma opiate concentrations after a single preoperative addition of 0.1 mg fentanyl to epidural bupivacaine analgesia in comparison to epidural bupivacaine analgesia alone.	0.7285306881569776
The quality of the morphological analysis of myocardial and coronary alterations depends essentially on the method chosen for the heart dissection.	0.5328145167843599
Even if previous postmortem coronary angioplasty is not feasible, the best results are obtained by transverse sectioning of the ventricles in a bread-loaf fashion subsequent to formalin-fixation and serial cross-sectioning of the coronary arteries, with decalcification in addition if necessary.	0.6053721595503433
The distribution pattern of disseminated myocardial necrosis, the longitudinal, circumferential and transmural extent of infarction, its age and sequelae and its correlation to the coronary supplying areas can be evaluated with better accuracy than by dissecting the heart chambers according to the flow of blood.	0.6499604950546463
Cross-sectioning of coronary arteries with preservation of their luminal shape allows proper examination of the degree and extent of luminal narrowing, plaque hemorrhage, parietal and occluding thrombi and the effects and complications of angioplastic procedures or bypass surgery.	0.5527537773504199
Transverse sectioning of the heart is a prerequisite for adequate examination following sudden cardiac death and short-term territorial ischemia.	0.6350301889052682
Full-thickness samples of the ventricular walls, taken systematically with respect to coronary narrowing and coronary supplying areas, enable identification of early myocardial damage.	0.5614754989311604
Total hip replacement is one of the most successful procedures in surgery.	0.7808860221737759
In Germany there is a great variety of cemented and uncemented implants with different principles of fixation.	0.577308028173636
We reviewed the different principles, with particular reference to long-term clinical outcome, and discuss the most popular systems available in Germany.	0.6845603213991349
Despite many new developments which have been made in the field of cementless hip replacement, cemented total hip arthroplasty will remain the "gold standard" until prospective long-term data (>15 years) of cementless systems become available.	0.6585245701591508
To summarize current knowledge on surgical therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis).	0.5014329588928315
Procalcitonin is a propeptide of calcitonin.	0.25787363173512307
It is usually not detectable in healthy volunteers but appears in high concentrations in the serum of patients with severe bacterial, parasitic or fungal infection.	0.7002163835617221
In contrast, procalcitonin levels do not or only moderately increase during viral infections or during non-infectious systemic inflammatory states.	0.5614398335040839
Because of these properties, procalcitonin has been proposed to serve as a marker of severe infections and sepsis.	0.7408285282426464
Increased procalcitonin levels have recently been shown to indicate the severity of systemic infection with increasing specificity.	0.5982383923890846
Normally, procalcitonin is produced in the C-cells of the thyroid gland.	0.42141449981924695
The origin of the high levels of procalcitonin in septic conditions is not fully understood.	0.5765788292608399
Although procalcitonin has drawn attention as a marker of severe systemic infections, a recent study suggests it may also be a mediator of sepsis.	0.6371607687146641
More studies are needed to uncover the nature and pathophysiological role of this molecule.	0.44639606671929305
Fractures of the hand sceleton are common injuries.	0.621713358788512
These are or are associated with phalangeal fractures.	0.3763874006244104
Kirschner wires can be used for osteosynthesis, but can cause lesions of periphereal finger structures.	0.7532768905974367
The aim of our study was to record the incidence of lesions in peripherial structures of the fingers caused by retrograde crossed inserted Kirschner wires of 1.0, 1.25, 1.4 and 1.6 mm diameter into the middle and proximal phalanges of the long fingers and the proximal phalanx of the thumb of 120 fresh cadaver hands.	0.8827858802207783
We found an increase of insertion attempt frequency and an increasing number of lesions with increasing Kirschner wire diameter.	0.5658313439513429
Because of these findings Kirschner wires of 1.0 or 1.25 mm diameter should be prefered to prevent the periphereal functional finger structures.	0.656360819791892
Fucosidosis, a rare lysosomal storage disease due to nearly complete deficiency of -L- fucosidase, was diagnosed in two unrelated male German patients who exhibited typical symptoms of this disorder including mental retardation, dysostosis multiplex, vacuolization of lymphocytes and progressive neurologic deterioration by the age of 3.2 and 4 years, respectively.	0.6896772425328026
In both cases, activity of -L-fucosidase in leukocytes and cultivated fibroblasts was negligible.	0.5195947193012966
DNA analysis revealed a nonsense mutation (G401X) in exon 7 of the fucosidase gene; this leads to a premature stop codon and C-terminal deletion of 61 amino acids from the protein.	0.5541670049537719
Discussion: On account of the mutation a unique PFlMI restriction site is obliterated; this simplifies molecular diagnosis of the G401X mutation.	0.526084578652351
So far, the mutation G401X has not been found in any other population.	0.6592159851423132
The main reason for posttraumatic secondary brain damage is cerebral hypoxia.	0.39808033536301063
Both, severity and duration of hypoxia are crucial in determining wether irreversible cerebral infarction will occur or not.	0.4288453809822751
For the clinical routine, the diagnosis of hypoxia is indirectly made by low CPP, low jugularvenous oxygen saturation (SjO2) or low tissue PO2.	0.6586179612028323
To minimize misleading false negative SjO2, the CT-Approach for the side of monitorig and calculation of arterial-jugularvenous lactate content for detection of anaerobic metabolism is recommended.	0.5710489611192404
Targeted treatment of hypoxia according to the underlying cause is mandatory.	0.6268927923578295
Primary goal is to increase cellular oxygen delivery by correction of low arterial oxygen content and elevation of regional CBF.	0.511496921611332
Within the autoregulatory range decreasing CPP causes vasodilation and increasing CPP vasoconstriction with increasing or decreasing cerebral blood volume respectively.	0.3664858148323721
Initially elevation of the lower autoregulatory threshold often requires CPP 70 mmHg.	0.5265456025229956
Targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension must avoid decreasing CPP.	0.37006836390725745
In the early postrautmatic phase prevention of cerebral hypoxia relies on management of CBF by means of CPP and cerebral vascular resistance.	0.47505226466505024
Thereafter targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension caused by cerebral edema and hypervolemia are increasingly important.	0.40288561106454307
Today, orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for the end-stage of various liver diseases, and a 1-year survival rate of 80 % and a 5-year survival rate of 70 % in elective patients without tumor are reported in international surveys.	0.9924726238720798
The liver transplant programme of the Inselspital in Bern is small compared with international centres, which may raise questions about the results and the justification for such a programme.	0.657234176151124
Over a period of 66 months, 62 liver transplantations were performed in 60 patients at the Inselspital.	0.59966664404421
The hospital mortality was 3.3 %, and the 2.5-year overall survival rate was 92 % for elective cases without tumor.	1.0114277417604527
After a median follow-up of 30 months, 68 % of all patients were re-integrated in housework or full- or part-time in their profession, and 83 % were independent from the help of others.	0.8414165466692726
We conclude that a small liver transplant programme based only on routine resources can achieve results comparable to the international standards.	0.4804847383376455
Accidental hypothermia (AH) can be defined as an unintentional decrease in core temperature below 35  °C during cold exposure by individuals without intrinsic thermoregulatory dysfunction.	0.4516561292734113
Pathophysiological changes can be attributed both to the severity of hypothermia and to co-morbid factors such as trauma, submersion, intoxication and underlying diseases.	0.47823948127990323
In trauma victims stratified according to the Injury Severity Score, the factor hypothermia is considered to be a poor prognostic sign for survival.	0.6559369601593524
In these patients rewarming therapy should be applied as soon as possible.	0.6353158599490291
In the Utrecht University Hospital, adult patients with AH are managed according to an algorithm based on their presenting hemodynamic conditions.	0.5103314053467961
Patients with perfusing cardiac rhythms and systolic pressures over 80 mmHg will receive continuous arteriovenous rewarming (CAVR).	0.328663973515178
Arrested and hemodynamically instable patients are treated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	0.3701934397046383

Fourteen patients had a trauma as the cause of hypothermia.	0.5624579655540259
Twenty patients were treated according to the algorithm (CAVR n = 18, CPB n = 2) and two patients were alternatively managed.	0.7961310155539854
Mortality in the CAVR group was 28 % and total mortality reached 32 %.	0.6748093514115517
Complications of CAVR are related to placement and removal of vascular catheters and may be severe in these patients with impaired coagulation.	0.624737668551339
CAVR permits a good access to the (trauma-) patient and rewarming can be continued synchronously with diagnosis and treatment of various injuries.	0.7031491799267973
The grading of long-tubular-bone pseudarthrosis depends on the biological reaction or lack of reaction in pseudarthrosis or non-unions.	0.5304316597221648
Hypertrophic and oligotrophic pseudarthrosis belongs to biologically reacting non-unions, whereas non-reacting non-unions are necrotic pseudarthrosis and defective non-unions with partial decline or complete destruction of cortical substance.	0.47044028146145256
Pseudarthrosis is a serious disturbance or disorder within the regulation cycle in fracture healing, which consists of osteoregeneration, osteovascularization and stabilization.	0.4638154921426423
The causes and underlying reasons for disturbance of this regulation cycle are primarily massive destruction of the biological and functional very important unity of periost, cortical substance and medullary space.	0.5164888468655299
This can occur from trauma, but it happens more often from surgical procedures that do not take the biological principles of bone-healing into account.	0.6999253688637892
Surgical strategies and interventions that respect the importance of periosteal tissue, cortical tissue and medullary space do fill the biological principles of fracture-healing and fracture union.	0.49132558072889393
Background: Clonidine, an 2-receptor agonist, has been reported to prolong the blocking actions of local anaesthetics.	0.7314186005004424
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of spinally injected clonidine on the duration of spinal anaesthesia by mepivacaine and on the postoperative demand for analgesics.	0.5817958027576892
Differentiation of an elevated, repeatedly determined platelet count (>=500x109/l) includes the discrimination between reactive causes generated by a variety of underlying conditions and a neoplastic myeloprolifera-tive disorder (CMPD).	0.5044083627643264
In addition to clinical findings, the evolution of laboratory data during follow-up and histology of the bone marrow exerts a significant diagnostic impact.	0.7714089603527567
Characteristic features are not only expressed by hematopoiesis, but also by the myeloid stromal compartment.	0.7368659043461534
While the megakaryocyte-rich subtype of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and the 5q- syndrome (MDS) are dominated by abnormal micromegakaryocytes, in polycythemia vera (PV) this cell lineage reveals a pleomorphous appearance.	0.5509551734742439
In essential thrombocythemia (ET), a prevalence of giant megakaryocytes with deeply lobulated (staghorn-like) nuclei may be encountered.	0.46373577857000636
A clear-cut discrimination of ET from early (hypercellular) stages of idiopathic (primary) myelofibrosis (IMF) presenting with thrombocythemia becomes possible, provided the conspicuous atypical features of megakaryopoiesis characterizing the latter entity are taken into account.	0.49058320085394325
Moreover, CML displays a predominance of the granulocytic lineage whereas PV shows a panmyelosis or trilineage proliferation, involving erythropoiesis, in particular.	0.5535959381755359
In contrast, erythropoiesis is markedly reduced in CML and to a lesser degree also in IMF.	0.509366288679321
In CMPDs extreme values of iron deposits may be found, ranging from a total lack (PV) to minor amounts (CML) and a normal staining reaction (ET).	0.6461759488117632
Similar results are exhibited regarding reticulin fibrosis, which is usually not present in ET, rarely observed in PV and detectable to a variable degree in CML and IMF.	0.5798397226199191
Nevus cell aggregates in lymph nodes are uncommon.	0.4829923083505834
This benign phenomenon may be difficult to differentiate from metastatic neoplasia.	0.48253336612213493
We report the case of a 56-year-old patient who underwent breast biopsy, followed by radical mastectomy including lymphadenectomy.	0.6313558155998953
Histological examination revealed solid cell aggregates as foreign tissue in the capsule of 1 of 11 identified lymph nodes devoid of any keratin immunoreaction.	0.45796697638197736
Strong immunohistological staining for the S-100 protein confirmed the diagnosis of nevus cell aggregates.	0.5543197255662252
We report the case of a seven year old girl presenting with varicella infection 14 days after kidney transplantation.	0.5209979026090253
Cramp-like abdominal pain and a subileus were the first symptoms.	0.5756692754533993
Enemas did not relieve the symptoms, and the following laparotomoy with Tenckhoff catheter explantation was performed which did not reveal any pathologic abnormalities.	0.5870966385133961
Two days after the beginning of abdominal pain an unspecific papular rash developed.	0.4917098911959418
Further twelve hours later skin vesicles appeared and varicella-zoster virus was isolated from their fluid.	0.35375692124031977
Despite high dose administration of aciclovir and varicella-zoster immune globulin further visceral dissemination occurred and finally lead to liver failure and intravascular coagulopathy.	0.34643823194282536
The patient died 18 days after kidney transplantation from multiorgan failure.	0.5459623321422995
The unconscious patient presents an challenging emergency in the intensive care unit.	0.2970743167562977
Patient evaluation and treatment must occur simultaneously.	0.2997301291699748
After checking vital signs, deciding about cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation, an intravenous line must be established, blood samples collected and glucose and thiamine should be given.	0.5506939407197806
The physical and neurological examination should be performed in a efficient way and must consider the following eight points: best reaction to loud commands, best motor reaction to noxious stimuli, respiratory pattern, size and reactions of pupils, eye movements, corneal and blink reflex, meningismus, muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes.	0.5468013834029011
With this approach it is possible to formulate a working diagnosis, and the appropriate diagnostic steps can be performed.	0.7406779034969996
A severe course of alcohol withdrawal has been observed in 28% of patients in a neurological intensive care unit due to complicating central nerve system (CNS) diseases.	0.7894687145017145
In any atypical alcoholic delirium, especially with focal neurological signs, partial seizures, or decreased level of consciousness, CNS diseases like meningoencephalitis, intracranial hemorrhage, or central pontine myelinolysis must be diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) tap.	0.6122646962012709
The diagnostic and prognostic value of CT scan and CSF analysis was examined in 32 persons with alcohol withdrawal syndrome or delirium tremens.	0.6036902666182709
Neurological complications and cerebral convulsions at the beginning of delirium tremens appear to predispose the patient to a protracted clinical course and necessary mechanical ventilation.	0.5557397178024431
Blood-CSF barrier permeability is increased in 70% of alcohol withdrawal patients and that also seems to be a marker of a prolonged clinical course.	0.6913199518572349
Cerebral atrophy as shown in CT scan does not play a role in predicting clinical course.	0.452361966124247
In our experience, CT examination or lumbar puncture is not necessarily recommended if clinical signs are typical for alcohol delirium.	0.5805826853181988
Recently, an implantable hearing aid for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss has been developed.	0.6380488849678089
One component of the device is the microphone for implantation into the posterior canal wall.	0.5503094259381075
The membrane of the microphone can be covered by skin, cartilage, or fascia, avoiding reduction in sound transmission at the same time.	0.5966776842664101
In the study presented here, the microphone was implanted into 50 cadaver specimens of human temporal bone.	0.71475360419903
Localization of the microphone was determined by the anatomical situation of the facial nerve.	0.8848120484337396
The microphone and the piezoelectric transducer could be implanted in 78% of the temporal bones after total mastoidectomy.	0.6999087377918826
In the final version of the microphone, the size was 4.5 mm and total weight 400 mg.	0.8877191896533604
Collagen vascular diseases, representing systemic soft tissue disorders, may cause a broad spectrum of pathologic changes of the respiratory tract.	0.7341238092474598
The type and extent of manifestations can vary considerably among individuals and entities.	0.4163850820478871
This survey describes the chest radiographic and, in particular, high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) findings of individual lesions of the respiratory tract.	0.694656535484491
It includes fibrosing alveolitis (alveolitis, interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis) and bronchial (bronchitis/bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis), pleural and vascular manifestations, as well as lymphadenopathy and abnormalities related to therapy.	0.4958257967758211
We present typical patterns of changes in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS, scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD, Sharp syndrome), Sjögren syndrome, overlap syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).	0.4633003767998372
Furthermore, we describe findings which are specific for individual entities such as esophageal involvement in PSS, acute pneumonitis and pulmonary hemorrhage in SLE, lymphoproliferative disease in Sjögren syndrome and necrobiotic nodules in RA.	0.5376352697110662
The psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders, or "hysterical" symptoms are increasingly understood as ways of coping with traumatic experiences in childhood or adolescence such as abuse or violence.	0.5992717266898854
Dissociation with induced depersonalisation, derealisation, and personification of objects as only good or only bad is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.	0.48421250800780563
Unassimilated memories of traumata have a retraumatizing effect and call for defence through eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harming behaviour, or social acting-out.	0.44698220095533475
Against this psychodynamic background we describe a method of trauma-therapy which uses experiences of hypnotherapy and of Guided affective Imagery.	0.48418483234698273
In the preparatory phase a secure inner space and contact to inner helpers are established in the imagination using a resource-oriented approach.	0.4360324641282618
The actual trauma-therapy consists of a gradual leading-up to the traumatic scenes through consistent, minimally retraumatizing confrontation, followed by consolation and the ability to let go.	0.5869688893082946
In the final phase there is a return to resource-oriented creativity and concrete life planning.	0.579200513120186
All patients of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Erfurt Hospital with odontogenic pyogenic infections have been analyzed in a retrospective study over a period of 10 years, from 1987 to 1997.	0.6031827522286815
This included questions concerning frequency, seriousness and treatment of these infections, social changes in the environ prove effects about the referral behaviour and the course.	0.6576582500742547
Odontogenic pyogenic infections are mixed infections.	0.2533837849998838
Aerobic agents such as hemolytic streptococcuses and staphylococcuses as well as anaerobic bacteria and  fungi can be involved.	0.3489732941385331
Cephalosporine, aminobenzylpenicillin in combination with -lactamase inhibitor, alcylaminopenicillin and lincosamide are recommended based on analysis of infection resistance as first choice medications with carbapeneme as a reserve antibiotic.	0.4096661367359692
Hospitals are competing with each other for the limited financial resources available in the health care sector.	0.4738517957329885
Comparison of hospitals is legally required (BPflV § 5) to improve financial efficiency in the health care sector and make competition between hospitals keener, while also objectivizing it.	0.5785897523846943
If comparison of the hospitals is really to enhance profitability or efficiency, and not just to reduce the prices for hospital stays regardless of quality, it must extend to far more than the global figures in the compilation summarizing performance and calculation and the hospital statistics (no.	0.6566770177077313
of cases, days of care, length of stay, case lump sums and special fees).	0.4896928642038214
Documentation of particular features of the patient population, the potentials of the hospital and description of the treatment processes yield valuable information on capacity and performance level.	0.821416217640598
With rising costs, the danger is growing that the quality and risk dimension of the actual medical treatment will not be promoted with the same enthusiasm by those offering the service.	0.6358087341777547
Hospital audit does not only allow a check on the hospital's own situation with regard to performance, quality, efficiency and patient satisfaction, but can also provide a basis for structural planning.	0.635069215962822
The fact is that all efforts made and steps taken by the responsible persons in the hospital to improve the quality of structures, processes and results can only be successful if they are also perceived by the patients, the doctors who refer them and the visitors.	0.6319870618959902
If hospital audit is restricted to the bed occupancy and the invoicing data, it is only realistic to expect cuts in performance level.	0.4729822485174942
This would be bad for the patient and, in view of the consequent costs, also for the overall costs in the health care sector.	0.8037109307767337
Against the backdrop of a future performance-related system of remuneration instead of the principle of covering one's own costs that has been in place hitherto, openness about treatment results gains in importance as a competition parameter for qualified hospitals.	0.4955154956362336
Laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in 120 patients scheduled to undergo either radical perineal prostatectomy or radiation therapy.	0.5570356309990697
On average 13 lymph nodes were resected in each patient, and 21 patients were found to have metastatic disease in 1-9 lymph nodes.	0.6798367745478723
After an initial learning curve, mean operative time was reduced significantly, allowing laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical prostatectomy to be performed as a one-stage procedure.	0.820495330232239
The overall complication rate was 10 %; open revisions were necessary in only 2 of 120 patients.	0.6063889023938434
Postoperative hospital stay was 2 days in patients undergoing laparoscopic lymph node dissection only.	0.7018197634023153
This minimally invasive procedure is particularly beneficial to patients with lymph node metastases not undergoing radical prostatectomy, as well as to patients planned to be treated by radiation therapy.	0.7060537575482475
The combination of laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical perineal prostatectomy avoids an abdominal incision and thus shortens both the hospital stay and the period of convalescence.	0.5998773183100904
Taking the concepts of psychic structure and internal representation as an example, three different ways of relating psychoanalytic concepts to neurobiology are presented and discussed: the localizing, the metaphorical and the modelling relation.	0.6554147732473589
The need is stressed not to mix up the different levels of description and explanation too early; at the same time it is argued that - after the dismissal of the old metapsychology - this way of relating offers a new chance to integrate neurobiological aspects in the concept of psychic structure without falling into the traps of biologistic reductionism and individualism.	0.5376760037932462
Following augmentation of the upper extremity muscles necessitated by damage to the brachial plexus, special post-operative care programs are required to provide the patient with the best possible results.	0.8170871921431742
Proper care requires cooperation between the orthopedic surgeon, physical therapists and nurses.	0.4568167268556337
Only then can postoperative rehabilitation and functional control of the extremity improve.	0.5174131560836296
We describe interdisciplinary postoperative care programs for augmentation of the deltoid muscle with trapezius transfer, arthrodesis of the glenohumeral joint, biceps augmentation with the latissimus dorsi transfer, Steindler flexorplasty and augmentation of flexors/extensors muscles in the hand.	0.424590973264764
The prevalence of type I allergy against latex was investigated in dental students by questionnaire, prick tests and the determination of specific IgE antibodies.	0.5839169155263065
Positive prick tests against different latex fluids were found in 18 (8.7%) of 206 students, with clinical relevance in 11 cases.	0.8374620988435816
When the total number of students in each semester was taken into account an increase in the minimal prevalence of clinically relevant latex allergy from 2% in the second semester to 10.4% in the tenth semester was seen.	0.7606589695045065
A history of glove intolerance presenting as a wheal-and-flare reaction was associated with a type I allergy against latex in only 50% of the affected subjects.	0.6067481232587898
Atopic diseases and hand eczema of different causes proved to be risk factors in 16 and 5 of 18 students with latex allergy, respectively.	0.5075901158841872
A high-ammonia accelerator-free latex fluid proved to be a very reliable test medium compared to the less sensitive determination of specific IgE antibodies to latex.	0.6386119989090647
Gastrointestinal obstruction is a frequently observed emergency with tumor patients.	0.3797857070930442
In addition to tumor relapse, the development of a second tumor or intraperitoneal tumor spreading, and benign alterations in advanced tumor stages (radiogenic stenosis, adhesions) may also be the cause for the obstruction.	0.7730409200865004
The main objective of therapy is an attempt to eliminate the intestinal obstruction through surgery.	0.6202270303953118
If this is not possible because of advanced intra-abdominal tumor expansion, several endoscopic or interventional radiology methods, and drugs are available, that are used on an individual basis and based on prevailing experience to relieve the patient's condition.	0.750598029947095
The case of a 60-year-old female patient with a supraglottic larynx carcinoma (T3N2CM0) and bilateral enlargement of the laryngeal sacculus is presented.	0.7236610064670529
On one side, the sacculus opened atypically into the left vestibular fold.	0.48698937078400806
The sacculus is a physiologic part of the roof of Morgagni's ventricle, the size of which can vary greatly.	0.6124121076334375
These canal-like structures can be the point of origin of cysts, laryngoceles, mucoceles, and pyoceles.	0.5028411406123573
Adverse effects of resuscitation due to closed-chest cardiac massage are common, and the incidence is increased when an incorrect technique is used.	0.7056652621753909
Nevertheless, thrombolytic therapy of a myocardial infarction can become necessary even after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).	0.4715762599594198
In these patients, the risk of thrombolytic therapy-induced bleeding is immanent.	0.6942238305334147

An overview of the 30 years history and developement of documentation and information systems in the Orthopedic University Hospital Heidelberg is presented.	0.5205078490008941
Since the foundation in 1967 four developmental phases can be described: first initiatives of medical doctors, establishment of a basic documentation system for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning and realisation of information systems with the possibility of controlling in medical areas and thereby steering of the services.	0.5253611627093167
Planning and realisation were accomplished within the framework of the masterplans and concepts of the university clinics of the state of Baden-Württemberg.	0.5743121649765481
The treatment success of nCPAP therapy (nasal continuous positive airway pressure) depends partly on the relief of symptoms and partly on long-term patient acceptance and the related avoidance of complications.Nasal complaints constitute the most frequently reported side effects and, together with problems of mask application, are among the primary factors causing an nCPAP-therapy to be prematurely discontinued.	0.619673723906148
The foramen ovale is anatomically open in 25 % of individuals, but functionally closed by the higher pressure in the left antrum.	0.7367847092120837
Right-to-left shunt and subsequent paradoxical embolism may occur when pressure in the left antrum rises, for example, as a result of pulmonary embolism.	0.7423527044102041
In the present case we demonstrate a patient who presented 20 days after osteosynthetic treatment of a femoral fracture with word-finding deficits.	0.7400354052230017
Cerebral MRT revealed a fresh ischemic insult.	0.24624469395337892

The diagnostic strategies in multiple trauma aim at rapid identification of life-threatening injuries, recognition of serious organ lesions, and evaluation of the systemic trauma impact, as well as the resulting host reaction.	0.6215558750552683
Besides improvements in the structure and organization, major innovations in imaging techniques have significantly improved and accelerated evaluation of the patient with multiple injuries in the emergency room.	0.8756764244578672
Systematic diagnostic work-up, integrated multidisciplinary approach, and defined algorithms for traumatic key symptoms represent the hallmarks of successful emergency room management.	0.47225248545195936
In particular, diagnostic work-up of injured body cavities using sonography and helical computed tomography are evaluated.	0.5740682879205266
Pheochromocytomas are functionally active, catecholamine-secreting tumours of chromaffin tissue.	0.31754940583731966
The mainstay of pharmacological therapy is preoperative treatment with oral phenoxybenzamine.	0.40975678431777157
This drug irreversibly alkylates alpha-1-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle and renders them nonfunctional, thereby causing vasodilatation.	0.5089916301361116
The duration of action of a single dose is approximately 24 h. Therefore, postoperative hypotension is a hazard of therapy with phenoxybenzamine if adequate plasma volume repletion is not provided.	0.5956113205251895
Prazosin, a short-acting, competitive alpha-1 blocker, has been used preoperatively, but has been criticized for its failure to adequately prevent perioperative hypertensive episodes.	0.7610796776801039
Case report: Case presentation of a 59-year old female patient, who has been treated for her cancer by a physician of internal medicine with peroxodisulphuric acid.	0.6233463854551974
For this therapy to be successful - according to the physician - all drugs especially the analgetics had to be stopped.	0.7845440808408637
We present a case of primary plasmocytoma of the left upper bronchus.	0.828894881498552
Occlusion led to atelectasis of the left upper lobe and subsequent poststenotic pneumonia.	0.6007980881371593
Therapy consisted of local excision of the bronchus and postoperative radiotherapy.	0.5896950508567211
This type of lung-conserving therapy in a case of primary plasmocytoma has not been described before.	0.7916924491947888

The use of the Kaufman-Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) was evaluated with a sample of 50 mentally disabled adults in a wide age range, as there exist no special tests for this group of patients.	0.7326664279071288
Intercorrelation- and factor analyses, and correlations with the German adaptation of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (HAWIE-R) proved the use of the K-ABC to be valid.	0.6729416466680084
As an assessment battery for children designed for the wide age range from 2-6 to 12-5 years is more adequate to the capability of intellectually impaired adults, the K-ABC delivers results on individual strengths and weaknesses, based on a neuropsychological theory.	0.6043957126377424
Thus the individual cognitive abilities can be assessed with more differentiation, and that gives an important base for intervention, partial remediation, and placement.	0.6730032195365678

Only one third of the physicians received such reports routinely.	0.6438014532769952
Fail-safe information are requested by Mx physicians and can help them to better target biopsy recommendations.	0.3592628087259115
A (regional) quality assurance center should be made responsible to analyse the flow of information in mammography screening, to fill in gaps and to speed up professional cooperation.	0.6179495103493697
The high rate of recurrence after the treatment of adhesive obstruction demands special prophylactic treatment.	0.5794979408776811
In a 13-year period, 52 out of 95 patients with major adhesions were provided with a long nasointestinal tube for intestinal splinting intraoperatively.	0.5935965415496719
The was being left in situ on an average of 6.6 days.	0.7010703683176653
After an observation period of at least 36 months a recurrence was seen in 2 of these 52 patients (3.9 %; causes: volvulus after 6 months/fibrinous peritonitis on the 6th postoperative day).	0.6811686279593762
Amongst the 43 'non-splinted' patients, recurrence of adhesive obstruction was documented in 8 cases (18.6 %; causes: adhesions after 0.3-136.9 months).	0.6014084957158413
In the course of aftercare abdominal complaints were significantly fewer in patients who had been splinted.	0.5989943256067716
Complications concerning the nasointestinal tubes did not occur.	0.23412836911774004

As a control group (group 2), 78 patients were enrolled who underwent isolated aortic valve replacements by standard sternotomy in the same period.	0.5774033623747242
AV-synchrony and rate-responsive pacing are known as major factors to increase the maximum working capacity in patients with chronotropic incompetence.	0.4946296121758598
However, their importance throughout low-levels of exercise is poorly evaluated.	0.5689750787139048
We studied 11 patients with implanted dual-chamber pacemakers (Telectronics, META 1254) concerning oxygen uptake kinetics during serial treadmill exercise testing at a constant workload of 35 W (LITE protocol).	0.4318350448079557
Each patient was tested in VVIR-, DDD-, and DDDR-mode.	0.6231816573694834
All AV delays were constant at 160ms.	0.1967469897588745
The oxygen deficit (O2D), mean response time (MRT) for oxygen uptake, and a oxygen deficit index (O2Di) were determined.	0.7650091006840117
In addition, the heart rate (HR) and bloodpressure were monitored.	0.613897727117799
Results: Significant differences (p<0.01) were observed in HR and O2D when comparing both DDD- to VVIR- and DDD- to DDDR-modes.	0.7687686187501916
Comparing the randomly synchronous VVIR- to the DDDR-mode, only the MRT of oxygen uptake demonstrated a significant decrease in the DDDR-mode (p<0.05).	0.6666496145314422
There were also significant decreases in O2Di and MRT in the DDDR-mode, as compared to the non-rate responsive DDD-mode (p<0.01).	0.5232706923056775
Stress testing in PM patients with an appropriate chronotropic response to low intensity exercise demontrates that AV synchrony is of much less influence on oxygen uptake kinetics than the rate-adaptive pacing.	0.4664767566996032
Purpose: This paper discusses the role of different imaging modalities in the diagnostic work-up of Crohn's disease (CD).	0.7792026340228732
Introduction: Results of animal experiments have demonstrated that the osseous integration of non-cemented prostheses can, at the very least temporarily, be impaired by the application of non-steroidal antiphlogistic agents (such as diclofenac).	0.6118606990360652
It is the objective of this study to examine whether there is a direct influence of diclofenac used in usual clinical dosages (3 times 50 mg daily) on bone cells and their progenitor cells which would explain the observed slow integration of the prostheses.	0.8205630292550617
Methods: To investigate this, cultivated human in vitro osteoblasts and stromal bone marrow cells were incubated with increasing doses of the medications.	0.6160722692131232
Our study focused on the effect of diclofenac application on proliferation and functional metabolism in both cell lines.	0.4027578785973346
The measurable maximal plasma concentration 2h after the application of one tablet Voltaren 50 reached 1.6µg/ml.	0.30380249463677883
This correlated with diclofenac concentrations between 1 and 10 ml found in our experiments.	0.426707151986329
The detected values were correlated to the control group (0 µg/ml diclofenac).	0.6454428985861281
Results: The drug effect upon osteoblasts was higher than on progenitor cells.	0.5196604087103626
The proliferation of in vitro stromal bone marrow cells, compared to untreated cells, was found to be decreased.	0.7568614799996244
We observed a decrease to 82% at a diclofenac concentration of 1 µg/ml, Osteoblasts exhibited a decrease to 97,5% at the same concentration.	0.806710489765196
The DNA synthesis increased to 118% in stromal bone marrow cells, in osteoblasts to 144%.	0.592924584574647
In contrast, we detected a neglectible decrease to 92% in the collagen synthesis of osteoblasts compared to untreated cells.	0.6530896836326628
The synthesis of osteocalcin by osteoblasts increased to 119%.	0.2861927525141544
The alkaline phosphatase activity was found to be decreased to 88% in stromal bone marrow cells and increased in osteoblasts to 111%.	0.5883312882514117
Conclusion: Temporary inhibiting effects on osseous integration in non-cemented prosthesis by diclofenac could be caused by a disturbance in the anabolic bone metabolism, exhibited by an increase of osteoblastic osteocalcin expression.	0.5333306914007782
Osteocalcin as a known negative regulator of the osteoneogenesis is most likely inhibiting the collagen matrix deposition.	0.40298522201539466
Recent investigations have controversially but convincingly interpreted the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (arteriosclerosis).	0.41663358814683876
Atherosclerosis can apparently be the result of ultrachronic, persistent infection by Chlamydia pneumoniae and not the result of heterogenous risk factors.	0.5047948359293714
The main arguments for chlamydial genesis are: Correlation of coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic diseases and antibodies against Chlamydia pneumoniae.	0.47687639308638596
(2) Chlamydia pneumoniae could be detected with different techniques (PCR, ICC, immunhistology, electromicroscopy, culture) in a high percentage of atheromas from different sites.	0.692636572859827
(3) According to three successful international studies with macrolides in coronary heart disease.	0.36364469660587645
(4) Target cells of atherosclerosis (endothelia, macrophages, muscle cells) can be infected by Chlamydia pneumoniae in vitro.	0.47007503808259793
(5) Provocation of arteriitis in animal experiments.	0.30369537528755575
(6) The reduction of incidence of atherosclerotic diseases since the 1960s, probably due to advances in antibiotic treatment.	0.6062521081280247
(7) Elevated levels of acute-phase proteins and other inflammatory signs (CRP, WBC count, fibrinogin) briefly before cardiac infarction occurs.	0.517605539178385
There are good arguments for intervention studies in coronary heart disease and other manifestations of atherosclerosis.	0.5195295778148021
The relevant antibiotics are available for chlamydial infections and are inexpensive and safe.	0.4873586598732645
Meticulous protocols and long-term monitoring of patients should be developed.	0.541131948070248
The pre- and postoperative symptoms of zygomatic bone fractures were examined in a follow-up study to prepare a classification proposal.	0.8154323447525905
A differential indication for minimally invasive therapy modes was looked for with respect to this proposal.	0.4097349623080666
Therapy of isolated zygomatic bone fractures consisted in repositioning with a hook and miniplate fixation across the frontozygomatic suture.	0.3642570952291172
The aims of this study were clinical and radiological assessment of the repositioning result in terms of aesthetics and stability and quantification of the postoperative remission of disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve.	0.7239195456914639
A total of 52 patients were examined.	0.7466437473851693
After the operation (on average after 3.5 days following the trauma) they were followed-up postoperatively for 12 months according to a strict schedule.	0.8058616406335081
Preoperatively, 49 patients reported disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve.	0.47423054487405664
Other symptoms, such as periorbital haematoma and flattening of the zygomatic prominence, were observed in 49 patients and 45 patients, respectively.	0.6290836574215859
All fractures were repositioned well as assessed clinically and radiologically.	0.49700218604395074
The aesthetic result was evaluated as symmetric and durable in all cases.	0.4485417395249789
Six months postoperatively 41 patients reported normal sensitivity in the area of the infraorbital nerve.	0.42550727594169563
In only five patients (10.2%) was the sensitivity loss persistent throughout the entire follow-up period.	0.787715991703531
Patients with primarily lacking diplopia developed neither eye motility disturbances nor postoperative enophthalmus in the following period.	0.4101574293017448
It can be concluded that the treatment of an isolated zygomatic bone fracture which satisfies aesthetic and functional requirements is possible by reposition and fixation with one miniplate at the lateral orbital rim.	0.5907798752258738
An additional osteosynthesis at the infraorbital rim or at the zygomaticomaxillary crista is not necessary.	0.4235442573473913
A routine revision of the orbital floor is only indicated in cases of preoperative diplopia.	0.5370499495334765
A zygomatic bone fracture connected with diplopia should be classified as combined zygomatic-/orbital floor fracture.	0.494490006489581
Chronic primary headache has a considerable impact on the quality of life.	0.48420418025138534
To date, this impact has been evaluated by measurements of the general pain specific impairment of the quality of life.	0.689162963933927
Headache specific measurements of quality of life or of disability caused by the headache are still missing for the German language.	0.7141808836446459
In America, a headache specific questionnaire, the "Headache Disability Inventory" (HDI), has been evaluated which is used in the presented study to create a German version, the "Inventar zur Beeinträchtigung durch Kopfschmerzen" (IBK).	0.7120941575789881
94 consecutive patients with a primary headache disorder (59 female, 35 male; mean age 40 +/- 12 years) were examined.	0.8747543460038716
Cronbach's alpha was a=0.90, the test-retest-reliability after three months was r=0.87.	0.41637924023593376
An analysis of subscales for emotional and functional disability showed similar values for the internal consistency and the test-retest-reliability of these subscales.	0.43340599455562384
The scores of the different headache types did not differ significantly.	0.6837139948252454
In post-hoc-analyses, however, cluster headache showed higher disability scores than migraine both in the total scale and in the subscales.	0.5101429504401314
The total score of the IBK was significantly correlated with the number of headache days per month (r=0.41; p<0.0003) but not with the duration of disease or other demographic parameters.	0.5795660131892547
The IBK is the first German headache specific measurement of certain aspects of the quality of life in chronic headache patients.	0.7199757925566554
It can be used in clinical settings to evaluate the current state of the patient or to monitor treatment and it can be used for scientific studies.	1.0398493288815776
Age and menstrual cycle have an important influence on the breast.	0.5763762146088154
This well-known fact is experienced in the daily routine of gynecologists and radiologists.	0.5086456532647703
The number of publications addressing the effect of these influences on imaging, however, is surprisingly low.	0.5889542336824466
The aim of this work is to describe the influences of age and menstrual cycle on the breast and to address their clinical relevance for mammography and MR mammography.	0.6886432981573302
Therefore, own data are presented concerning the age and menstrual cycle influences on breast parenchyma in dynamic MR mammography.	0.4639515329438532
Literature data are used to correlate mammography and MR imaging findings with these influences.	0.5924994238349376
The changes of the breast due to age and menstrual cycle have important direct implications on performing and reading conventional mammography and MR mammography.	0.504527037989755
The knowledge of these changes is also helpful in the interpretation of findings when comparing different methods.	0.564031883840345
Finally, the data gained by using imaging methods enable important basic insights into physiology and physiopathology of the breast in vivo.	0.6126020973604375
As part of our neonatal screening program we applied tandem mass spectrometry on 128.225 dried blood samples for detection of inborn errors of metabolism.	0.4058522657838542
Appendectomy is one of the most frequent surgical procedures.	0.5717991044269464
Accuracy in the clinical diagnosis of acute non-specific appendicitis, however, suffers from the fact that the symptoms and clinical findings of acute appendicitis can be mimicked by many other abdominal diseases.	0.7211434419551674
The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis, therefore, can only be definitely confirmed by pathomorphological analysis, the criteria of which are reviewed in this paper.	0.7665721390305968
Special emphasis is given to distinct variants of acute appendicitis and the significance of neuroappendicopathy.	0.62205801460114
Extra-articular interventions by osteotomies to correct the axial malpositioning of the joint (genu varum or valgum) are treatments proven over many years.	0.5794247792374558
The middle and long term results shows many patients are very satisfied.	0.5976265467917143
Unfortunately a uniform critical examination is lacking because the investigators used no scores.	0.31264896094206057
The good results by infra- and supracondylar osteotomies - some of them for 15 years and more - have to be achieved by prosthesis first.	0.7673619981609405
The important facts for gonarthrosis of the knee joint are the axial malpositioning, the miss load, and the instability of the joint; these facts are the cause for the complaints and for the restriction of functional efficiency.	0.7803961239457657
Therefore, indication of infra- or supracondylar osteotomies is not limited by the age of the patient.	0.712248851189153
The most important fact is the condition of the joint, especially the quality of bone, the instability of the joint, and the loss of bone.	0.9418036066921442
Given the right indication, the treatment of genu varum and valgum by osteotomies is an important factor in preserving the joint.	0.5904748832921
Also, there are still chances to do another operation, such a prothesis.	0.8706483784412515
A prothesis can be implanted if the osteotomy has no chance to preserve the joint.	0.43460579514988623
Psychic trauma may be followed by a variety of unpredictable reactions by the subject, which differ individually and are dependant upon the situation.	0.5403422347646433
Differentiation between psychic crises and psychiatric emergency situations (PES) is often difficult as the first might proceed into the second and definitions of the two tend to blur.	0.715983686019942
This article aims to overview the different psychic and psychiatric disturbances which are relevant in preclinical emergency medicine.	0.3836033864061004
A definition is offered to outline PES that require immediate medical intervention and crises due to psycho-social reasons.	0.3544329187997364

Acute pancreatitis is a multietiologic entity with rather diverse clinical courses.	0.3302692670748374
Whereas edematous pancreatitis has a mortality of less than 1%, nowadays; still approximately 20% of all patients with the necrotizing form succumb to the disease.	0.7646612297143245
To further improve therapeutic results a standardized approach should be used.	0.5456847252524231
For effective treatment the differentiation between edematous and necrotizing pancreatitis is crucial.	0.4612918710376406
All patients with signs of pancreatic necroses during abdominal ultrasound and patients with organ insufficiencies should undergo a CT-scan to define exactly the nature and the extent of the disease.	0.6604862660709442
Primarily all patients are treated conservatively.	0.7169061335257373
Main indications for operative intervention are signs for infection of pancreatic necroses and an acute abdomen due to local complications of acute pancreatitis.	0.6237141175845645
In cases of biliary origin an elective cholecystectomy has to be performed during a free interval to prevent a recurrence.	0.6687961281434474
Objective: Diagnosis of osteomyelitis is difficult in early state of disease.	0.582556276548183
Usually, characteristic X-ray findings cannot be obtained during the first week of disease.	0.7945375370120404
Sonography, scintigraphy and magnetic resonance tomography were compared at clinical manifestation of osteomyelitis.	0.5510653358894054
A 73-year old female patient is known to have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) since 1989.	0.6772217497538241
After a transmural anterolateral myocardial infarction with the development of a large apical aneurysma of the anterior wall, a previously measured gradient of 11 mm Hg in the LVOT is no longer detected.	0.694899449734102
As a consequence of this casuistry, "pseudo-myectomy" caused by myocardial as an example of an uncommon spontaneous course of HOCM.	0.6863364617009805
Aim: Intensified insulin therapy is the therapy of choice for patients with diabetes Type I.	0.7027398616740972
Intensified insulin therapy includes an basis-bolus insulin injection regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, several times daily blood glucose self-monitoring, self-adaptation of insulin dosages by the patients themselves and a far-reaching liberalization of nutrition.	0.45460006103373485
The patients learn selfmanagement of diabetes therapy in a structured treatment and teaching program.	0.45476481835258464

The treatment of idiopathic scoliosis over 40  ° (Cobb) during the growth period is under discussion concerning the indication for conservative or surgical treatment.	0.6672638076827012
Curve progression depends on the degree of the frontal and sagittal deformity, vertebral rotation, rigidity of the curve, the skeletal age, the age and sex of the patient, the familial frequency of scoliosis and the location of the curve.	0.744510454107641
In scoliosis over 40  ° progression is fast and the possibilities for successful conservative brace treatment are reduced during the growth period.	0.48915462620758926
Progression occurs more frequently in thoracic and double major scolioses, especially in young patients (Risser sign 0 and 1).	0.615682073721434
The purpose of this study was to evaluate low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with an open system and to correlate results obtained with the experience of the radiologist.	0.8298405312624608
Between August 1995 and May 1997, 75 patients at the Unfallchirurgische Universitätsklinik, Mainz, Germany, with an acute trauma of the knee joint were operated on arthroscopically after clinical examination, X-ray and MRI imaging.	0.7219735415445951
MRI analysis was performed by two independent radiologists with varying MRI experience without knowledge of the patient's history.	0.7421102702057454
The sensitivity and specifity of the more [U1] and the less experienced [U2] radiologist ranged from 83 to 100% (U1) and from 61 to 100% (U2).	0.6657235539638839
Positive and negative predictive value ranged from 83 to 100% (U1) and from 58 to 100% (U2); accuracy ranged from 92 to 100% (U1) and from 77 to 100% (U1).	0.5938699293688585
We conclude that the results of low-field MRI are comparable with those of high-field MRI and that differences in the results of the experienced and less experienced radiologist can be established.	0.8655159992437753
In intervention trials it was without exception possible to influence the development of atherosclerosis by a reduction of the LDL-cholesterol and an increase in HDL-cholesterol and to reduce complications like myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, angina or heart failure.	0.5708489810655978
Changes of lifestyle can be effective, but are rarely accepted and are difficult to communicate.	0.6595604062778595
Dermatosurgery has been gaining in importance in recent years.	0.3283550223358015
In departments of dermatology German-speaking countries the total number of operations increased by 58% from 1984 to 1991.	0.5815651803400301
The increase in the number of operations of moderate and extreme severity was especially marked.	0.5334822202135239
Out-patient dermatosurgery was also performed mainly by dermatologists as opposed to other specialties.	0.42220959157176813
From 1988 to 1992 dermatologists in private practice recorded an increase of 40.6% in the number of operative procedures they performed.	0.6289977584028507
The importance of dermatosurgery in hospital and private practice can be expected to continue increasing in the future; dermatologists must therefore prepare themselves for the present and future challenges inherent in surgery of the skin.	0.6440565813550093
There is evidence that diastolic function is a major determinant of overall cardiac performance.	0.5236479248281155
Intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) enables Doppler measurement of mitral inflow pattern (E/A ratio).	0.4663077438186224
The E/A ratio is suggested to be a reliable index of changes in myocardial relaxation.	0.6063195884345155
In the present study we compared the time course of the E/A ratio and the time constant of myocardial relaxation () assessed by direct left ventricular pressure recordings in patients before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	0.7233146665193184
After ethical approval, 12 patients undergoing CABG surgery were studied.	0.5200819087543366
Measurements of the E/A ratio and  were performed after induction of anesthesia (I), immediately prior to CPB with the pericardium open (II), 5 min after CPB (III), and after sternal closure (IV).	0.6866781896334707
Time constant of myocardial relaxation was calculated as the reciprocal value of the slope of the left ventricular dP/dt and left ventricular pressure plot.	0.6524342423592449
The E/A ratio was significantly decreased at the end of surgery (IV).	0.41898094453241475
In contrast,  was increased immediately after CPB, but decreased after sternal closure (IV).	0.5470342015760834
Cardiac index and heart rate both increased after CPB.	0.4255754661098864
The results of the present study demonstrate that diastolic dysfunction occurred immediately after CPB, as indicated by an increase in the time constant of myocardial relaxation.	0.7613604950172913
However,  improved rapidly to pre-CPB values.	0.6620720475693097
The E/A ratio alone failed to detect the initial post-CPB alteration in left ventricular relaxation.	0.4239340488944112
Acute exercise is followed by a mobilization of white blood cells, mainly induced by increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol.	0.5407869409036965
NK-cells react the most intensive, they can increase fivefold after intensive exercise.	0.49443609736245997
Additionally a weak acute-phase reaction occurs.	0.3275718695526269
Most of these changes normalize during twenty-four hours.	0.6203934170445328
Parameters of the humoral immune system may be different from the pre-exercise levels up to seventy-two hours.	0.5548259557027413
Repeated physical exercise, which is typical for sports, is followed only by small changes of immunologic parameters under conditions of rest.	0.6701406521148295
Epidemiological studies give clues that the rate of upper respiratory tract infections in athletes can be described by a j-shaped curve.	0.5292446329290899
Moderately active subjects have the lowest rate of infection.	0.3621757828349371
For this influence of exercise on health mainly functional changes seem to be important.	0.49928395092419225
Especially after exccentric exercise immunological cells can be seen in the muscle tissue, which remove destructed tissue.	0.611368306310862
Not very much is known about the role of the immune system in the regeneration of tendons and other bradytrophic tissues.	0.6056379353766018
To achieve septoplasty without compromising the surgical goal of attaining a straight and solid septum, even in cases of marked deviations or severe post-traumatic deformities, we now use a new technique in which the septal reconstruction includes the placement of a resorbable implant as a "compound graft".	0.6888009393360998
For this purpose the entire septal cartilage is removed, and the severely deviated part is divided into straight sections that are reconnected to each other to form a straight and solid plate.	0.5886310851066023
As connecting material we use a polydioxanon (PDS) foil.	0.3132286272700182
The sections of cartilage are sutured to the foil with PDS suture material.	0.29680561804368955
The compound graft thus constructed consists of the septal cartilage and resorbable alloplastic material and is reimplanted into the nose.	0.4351188539084738
The PDS and suture material are usually resorbed within 8 months, excluding long-term complications.	0.5274603535030253
During the past 2 years this method was used in treating 38 patients.	0.737595621162846
The surgical goal was attained in every case, and no immediate or long-term complications occurred.	0.8128525449299957
This method of combining septal cartilage with a resorbable implant leads to a better, significant correction of even severe septal deviations.	0.5922534180923967
Two types of corticosteroid receptors have been identified in the brain and pituitary that play an important role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.	0.5231326850305489
These glucocorticoid hormone binding receptors are the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).	0.4989195654155549
Evidently, a tight control of the concentration and function of these receptors is of prime importance for maintaining and regaining homeostasis after stressful challenges.	0.5664118928638019
Here, we describe a novel mechanism revealing a rapid upsurge in MR density in the hippocampus (a limbic structure highly involved in HPA axis regulation) after an acute psychologically stressful challenge.	0.6518731512795942
This rise in MR is accompanied by a stronger MR-mediated inhibitory control of the HPA axis.	0.51260383703657
Thus, an acute stressful experience results in a reorganization of the HPA axis involving a principal role of the hippocampal MR.	0.6293778205073132
This novel mechanism may be of significance for increasing our understanding of the etiology of stress-related disorders.	0.6706715328243067
The wide variety of therapeutic effects make neuroleptics potent drugs in the treatment of pain.	0.5275837856183285
Until now there has been no proof of their analgesic potency; in spite of this fact, neuroleptics are used to treat chronic pain states on the assumption that they do have analgesic potency.	0.6827646297006497
A metaanalysis was performed and 48 publications reviewed.	0.5220523708623143
Thirty-four, the majority of the studies, are case reports, retrospective analyses or non-randomised cohort studies.	0.7545327619259863
Most of these reports attest to a positive effect.	0.6642365214880886
However, only ten out of fifteen studies with a higher statistical study power describe a possible analgesic effect.	0.5687101850353234
None of the studies could differentiate between the effects of analgesia and sedation of the drugs used.	0.6078031153339958
The metaanalysis provides no evidence of intrinsic analgesic properties of neuroleptics for their use as adjuvant analgesics.	0.39809229358913784
Studies into the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke have indicated that treatment options are likely to be optimised when early signs of stroke are recognised and treatment is initiated within 3 hours from symptom onset.	0.5467475000125601
For most patients there is a long delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.	0.7209489040915797
Many factors are responsible for this time delay: signs and symptoms often go unrecognised by patients, relatives and bystanders and stroke is not given a high priority by medical staff.	0.49188603999448544
Although a small number of stroke patients is treated as emergency and attended to by the emergency medical services within this time window, this number could easily be increased by intensified public and emergency personnel education.	0.5732902085592954
For the future, we hope that emergency medical services (EMS) will be able to initiate therapies which must be administered within the first few hours of acute stroke.	0.6086362577336536
Standard of care by the EMS personnel includes maintenance of oxygenation, treatment of cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension as well as hyperglycemia and hyperthermia.	0.6198240452757884
Early notification by the emergency medical services about stroke patients would enable stroke teams to be present at admission, thus improving the likelihood of a better outcome for patients.	0.5588848883546794
A decrease in compliance of the ascending aorta caused by prosthetic replacement or "wrapping" may lead to a partial loss of the arterial Windkessel-function.	0.6342199888008128
The following study investigated the effects of this intervention on aortic input impedance.	0.5355591284306263
In 8 pigs, the wall of the ascending aorta was wrapped with a prosthesis.	0.6127507747137054
This approach was chosen to minimize additional influence of extended operative procedures on the ascending aorta, like extracorporal circulation, cardioplegia or blood loss.	0.5206878005745581
Flow and pressure were recorded before and after the intervention, and following Fourier Transformation, the aortic input impedance was calculated.	0.6929578194757421
Mean pressure, mean flow, and total peripheral resistance were unaltered, while there was a significant increase in blood pressure amplitude and characteristic impedance in response to the "wrapping" procedure.	0.7199630282892057
Thus, it becomes obvious that even the loss of elastic properties of the ascending aorta only leads to an increase of left ventricular load.	0.7727761741774233
Cervical lymphadenopathies are widespread diseases in otorhinolaryngology.	0.2330037353602138
There are many differential diagnoses which have to be considered when swelling persists.	0.7103406875384654
To gain further information it is advisable to perform sonographically controlled fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNP).	0.42336498960043817
If there is no reliable result, it is necessary to remove a lymph node.	0.679372282701424
We report on the rare case of isolated histiocytosis X in lymph nodes.	0.6957690076055885
A 63-year-old male had noticed a swelling of the right side of the neck about 6 weeks previously.	0.7607348365089506
The preliminary examinations (FNP/blood examinations) revealed no pathological findings.	0.4938956410170089
Only the histological examination delivered the diagnosis of histiocytosis X.	0.5163529953645604
Systemic manifestation was excluded by staging examinations.	0.2699184944710625
No further therapy was necessary after lymph node extirpation.	0.38213137830762556
The report demonstrates how to diagnose and treat this rare disease.	0.431743088457562
We report our preliminary results using a new magnetic resonance imaging technique for visualization of the urinary tract.	0.7068490568386948
Using the paramagnetic contrast medium gadolinium diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA), we were able to obtain images of the urinary tract comparable to those obtained by conventional excretory urography.	0.5463566805616212
The major advantage of our technique is that besides good morphologic visualization, the excretion of gadolinium-DTPA can be studied simultaneously.	0.4823001230995331
We demonstrate our preliminary results in selected cases.	0.3461956264738525
Microcallus formations are demonstrable in nearly all cancellous bones by means of suitable preparation techniques.	0.3919492927923055
Histologically, these structures are immature fibrous bone formed in local overloaded parts of the trabeculae.	0.4659959271333215
Using a preparation technique that allows combined two- and threedimensional analysis, 26 normal human spines and 11 osteoporotic spines were investigated for microcallus.	0.5476809266617384
Microcallus formations occur frequently in people over 45 years of age.	0.36512023580033864
They are mainly localized in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine and occur significantly more frequent in females than in males.	0.6288094992335129
The number of microcallus formations depends more on the microarchitecture of the cancellous bone than on individual trabecular parameters.	0.35564175345163856
In about 33 % of cases microfractures are demonstrable in the centre of the microcallus formation.	0.6804949404831004
In noninvasive studies the bone mass could be misinterpreted due to microcallus.	0.3164395977128903
Although it indicates instability of the bone structure, microcallus formation is not a purely negative mechanism.	0.6738958514582624
It stabilizes and regenerates the bone tissue.	0.20161231616608444
Furthermore, complete new trabeculae can be formed due to bridges of microcallus between residual trabeculae.	0.40198104085391434
Osteoporosis is not the result of an inability to form microcallus.	0.6792407194123946
DNA cytometric investigations of intraosseous cystic lesions and osteoblastic tumors may be helpful in morphological diagnosis.	0.46077380118756595
The detection of a DNA-aneuploid stemline supports the diagnosis of a high-grade malignant bone neoplasm, even in small biopsies.	0.881667868247727
Solitary and aneurysmal bone cysts have DNA-diploid cell populations.	0.3948063103968568
Low-grade central osteosarcomas may show single-cell aneuploidies of varying extent as well as a DNA-diploid stemline.	0.6287374409099342
Their presence may be a sign of genetic instability within the population of neoplastic cells before a DNA-aneuploid stemline is established and should prompt careful postoperative observation.	0.5274707071375289
Although noise in general can induce hearing loss, environmental noise represents an important risk for children, teenagers and young adults.	0.5338975748079511
Epidemiological investigations now support the occurrence of an increasing number of irreversible hearing losses in these groups.	0.46096374628965747
Major causes of hearing loss are toys (guns), explosives and electroacoustically amplified music delivered by head sets or heard in discotheques and open air concerts.	0.35609438045465763
The development of arthroscopic wrist surgery has helped to understand the anatomy and pathology of the wrist joint.	0.6096583488031841
One of the most important functions of the arthroscopic inspection in the radiocarpal and mediocarpal joints is the evaluation of the wrist stability.	0.7416648350917253
State of the art in the hand surgery today includes a combination of arthroscopic and arthroscopic assisted operations.	0.6378353329584685
The arthroscopy of the wrist offers significant information independent from the standard radiological diagnostic tools.	0.5515804983002289
TFCC lesions and scapholunate dissociation remain to be the most common causes for arthroscopic wrist surgery.	0.7006243371100895
Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a consequence of vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency and in the majority of cases due to alcoholism.	0.6246972100393445
We report here the case of a 26-year-old male alcoholic who had stayed helplessly at home for 4 days until hospital admission.	0.6010693107104788
Clinical diagnosis was difficult due to major disturbance of consciousness.	0.41084361033241057
MRI showed an increase in signal intensity (T2-, FLAIR-weighted) around the third ventricle, the quadrigeminal bodies, the fornices, the mamillary bodies, the floor of the fourth ventricle and around the aqueduct.	0.6430500147967796
These findings were indicative of WE although of unusual extent.	0.41140304030940766
In this case MRI correlated well with clinical symptomatology.	0.5670780709981487
Therapy with thiamine was started immediately and symptoms as well as MRI findings resolved partially.	0.47072751106371796
The presented case illustrates the diagnostic usefulness of MRI in WE especially if the patient is of reduced consciousness and clinical investigation is limited.	0.6387362307312574

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral leukoplakia (OL) in HIV-positive patients and to evaluate the clinical and histopathological features and the presence of Candida hyphae and viral infections (HSV 1, 2, HPV, EBV and CMV) by immunocytochemical methods using mono- or polyclonal antibodies.	0.7917769976874701
A total of 269 HIV-seropositive patients, (222 men, median age 36.7 years and 47 women, median age 32 years) were registered.	0.7377782771026192
OL occurred in 20/269 (7.4%) patients (men, smokers, median age 38 years); the non-homogeneous form was observed in 11%.	0.6555146859310796
A lesional biopsy specimen was obtained from 8/20 patients.	0.38314194748920566
Specimens did not show signs of epithelial dysplasia.	0.43511532583290646
Candida hyphae were evident in 2/8 cases.	0.4438266742459698
Two patients tested positive for HPV and CMV; antibodies against EBV, HSV1 and 2 were negative.	0.3538446326402741
In conclusion, the prevalence of OL is comparatively high in this group of HIV-seropositive patients (7.4% vs. 0.9-2.2%).	0.8099183474659751
Moreover, the mean age of the study group at the time of diagnosis for oL was lower (38 years vs. 60 years).	0.9220269377513771
Damage/dysfunctioning of the heart forms part of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in sepsis and SIRS.	0.6154140255020487
This acute septic cardiomyopathy is often underestimated in degree and relevance, although about 10% of all sepsis fatalities are due to intractable heart failure.	0.6076025806962563
This potentially reversible cardiomyopathy is characterized by a considerable pump failure, not primarily ischemic, with coronary blood flow being normal or even enhanced; the left and right ventricle is enlarged as a consequence of an increased ventricular compliance.	0.6368322090745644
Damage of the heart can further be aggravated in case of additional right ventricular impairment due to pulmonary hypertension in ARDS.	0.5630399475296046
SIRS-cardiomyopathy in non-infectious MODS has common traits with acute septic cardiomyopathy.	0.4382430981155647
The pathogenesis of heart disease in sepsis and SIRS is multifactorial, the endotoxin/TNF/NO/ cGMP-cascade representing a main negative inotropic axis.	0.5059989480097161
Therapy of acute septic cardiomyopathy and SIRS-cardiomyopathy at present is still mainly symptomatic (volume substitution, inotropic/vasoactive agents); causal therapeutic principles are, however, put to test in the context of a comprehensive concept of causal sepsis treatment.	0.509265422857864
Fractures of the distal metaphysis of the tibia often include an extension into the ankle.	0.6789504286544181
Intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis should reduce the high incidence of soft tissue and ankle problems and should be an alternative to open plate fixation, with good ultimate functional outcome.	0.6767394764962811
Between January 1993 and December 1995, a prospective study on 49 patients with distal metaphyseal tibia fracture and involvement of the ankle was performed.	0.7238756524284599
All the fractures were treated with intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis, and plate fixation in cases of fibula fractures.	0.6171217160486085
There were 27 men and 22 women with an average age of 46.4  +/-  12.7 years (range 21-90).	0.7835959676496451
In most studies of the use of intramedullary nailing in distal tibial fractures the classification has been inadequate.	0.4843894516912924
Therefore a new classification according to Robinson et al.	0.44964048520724564
(1995) was used: 10 fractures were type II B (20.4 %), 13 were type II C (26.5 %), and 26 patients suffered a combination of type II B and type II C (53.1 %).	0.7460748607872896
This fracture type was defined as type II D for use in this study.	0.5567384221761252
The severity of soft tissue injury was recorded using the Gustilo system in case of open (n = 19) and the Tscherne system in case of closed fractures (n = 30).	0.5822853238119663
In 31 patients distal tibia fracture was accompanied by a fracture of the fibula, which was first stablized using a plate.	0.7460902481321376
For reconstruction of the distal articular surface, covered screw osteosynthesis was done.	0.6086413615683355
At the next step intramedullary nails were inserted and were statically locked proximally and distally.	0.4296549536045968
From January 1993 to February 1994, the reamed AO standard nail was used.	0.4822116920679845
After introduction of the unreamed tibial nail (UTN) all fractures were treated by this implant.	0.6665958454688269
Full load on the operated leg was allowed after 8 weeks.	0.4528461685634304
Union of the fracture was assessed by standard radiological and clinical criteria.	0.7818065070338076
Misalignment was defined as more than 5  ° of angular rotation.	0.6961882535389216
Further surgery due to a valgus deformity in the ankle joint had to be done in three cases.	0.7395477197803303
There were no deep infections.	0.5541741150864393
Three patients had a superficial infection in the ankle area, but surgical debridement was not necessary.	0.8918317732265064
A leg shortening was found in 4 cases, but it was less than 1 cm in every case.	0.9295437360945937
Therefore, surgical correction was not done.	0.6293002177458031
Patients were reviewed at intervals of 2, 6, and 12 weeks, and after 6, and at least 12 months.	1.0731737007090676
All 49 patients were finally reviewed after an average time of 15.7 months (range 12-38).	0.752739533360003
Bone fusion was reached 12.8 weeks (range 9-21) after the operative treatment.	0.8286278277442889
A specific assessment of the ankle symptoms was made using the score of Olerud and Molander (1984).	0.5828550835066344
In 29 patients excellent results were recorded.	0.33660798827704097
A satisfactory result was attained with 17 patients and just 3 patients were found to be unsatisfactory.	0.5184494156973407
Although proximity of distal tibia fracture to the ankle makes the treatment more complicated than for fractures of the tibial diaphysis, closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a good alternative to open reduction and plate fixation.	0.5689755647304382
The major advantages are closed procedure and simplified interlocking techniques.	0.32586363681366864
Therefore, closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a safe and effective method of managing this type of fracture.	0.5799901016581619
Laryngeal candidiasis is very rare in the absence of other more proximal diseases in the aerodigestive tract.	0.5370782221241599
The lesion shows pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia or acanthosis and, given its rarity, may be confused with cancer.	0.5665412816823007
In the present paper we report on a 56-year-old male patient who presented with hoarseness.	0.8120346499038824
Physical examination of the larynx revealed a hyperplastic lesion involving both vocal cords.	0.48996526397707935
The clinical aspect and the risk factor profile of the patient (ten bottles of beer and 40 cigarettes per day) generated the clinical diagnosis of laryngeal cancer.	0.7223344548713964
The histopathological examination of the specimen excluded a squamous cell carcinoma; however, it could not provide a clear diagnosis.	0.7106826646272489
Laryngeal papillomatosis and tuberculosis, which had been suspected, could be excluded.	0.7112572269893048
As the lesion progressed, further biopsies led to the diagnosis of candidiasis.	0.6036571062954049
Systemic antimycotic treatment with fluconazol and amphotericin caused a complete remission.	0.37734077283389716
Lymphatic spread of bronchial carcinoma can reach any part of the mediastinum, irrespective of the localisation of the primary tumor.	0.5659007925369429
Metastatic spread may not affect al topographical lymph node positions, but this is unpredictable.	0.5540562052633173
The number of lymph nodes in each position varies.	0.5486348867964251
Therefore, systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection includes all ipsilateral compartments of the mediastinum.	0.4551629411085178
It is also possible to reach contralateral sites.	0.7337770941286492
In right-sided thoracotomies the lymph node dissection is standardized.	0.623785479218561
Mobilizing the aortic arch and the large vessels also allows complete mediastinal dissection by a left-sided approach.	0.46721134963519617
The surgical technique is described.	0.6674574247138416
Perioperative morbidity does not increase.	0.32360614961008727
Systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection is the gold standard for evaluation of an exact pN stage.	0.5811849128793926
The stage-related survival rate is significantly improved.	0.684101739833335
Therefore, it should be required that systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection be standard in the surgical treatment of bronchial carcinoma.	0.7884781631878254
In the diagnosis and treatment of acute scrotal pain and swelling it is important to differentiate between testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis.	0.7406458777254622
A special case of a thirty-eight-year-old male asylant from Nepal was presented in the urological service with acute scrotal pain.	0.5635938005862593
To exclude testicular torsion, a diagnostic exploration of the scrotum was done with the findings of an acute funiculitis with abscess formation.	0.7000157723526498
Under surgical drainage of abscess together with medical treatment the acute inflammation disappeared.	0.3814587386788419

We studied 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 patients with Parkinson-plus-syndrome, trying to improve patients' gait by application of various external rhythmic stimuli, including metronome stimulation (96 beats per minute=middle andante).	0.593224040249439
The test course of the patients was 4x10 meters and 3 U-turns.	0.7594155651382601
The patients' gait quality under stimulation was compared with their free walk (velocity, number of steps, number of freezing episodes).	0.5735307545707313
Metronome stimulation significantly reduced the time and number of steps needed for the test course and also diminished the number of freezing episodes.	0.5835054340101175
March music stimulation was less effective and tactile stimulation (rhythmically tapping on the patient's shoulder) even produced negative results.	0.48365691474860306
The positive effect of metronome stimulation was also found, when the tests were not performed inside the hospital building, but outside in the hospital parc.	0.7087081790534878
Metronome stimulation was comparably effective in both patient sub-groups examined in this study (M. Parkinson, Parkinson-plus-syndrome) and seems to be an important additional help in the treatment of these patients.	0.7736573673349704
Electronical metronomes are not expensive, easy in handling, and portable.	0.5087328953381969
A theoretical explanation of metronome stimulation effectivity in patients with Parkinson's disease still needs to be elucidated.	0.43005544532307194

Nutrients and trophic factors independent of nutritional substrates influence the proliferation and the differentiation of the cells that make up the intestinal wall.	0.5343869922103125
The resorptive mucosa must be differentiated from immunologically active cells of the "gut-associated lymphatic tissue" (GALT).	0.5174554071798453
Glutamine is the main oxidative substrate of enterocytes and an important nitrogen donor; its importance becomes apparent in very sick patients.	0.4531942906679938
The amino acids arginine and ornithine are mainly important for immunological gut cells as precursors of NO and polyamine synthesis.	0.31412048049520874
Complex carbohydrates are fermented in the lower gut portions to short-chain fatty acids, mainly acetic, propionic and butyric acid.	0.46017004072953027
The trophic effect of these acids is also mediated via an improvement of blood flow.	0.5470533219418477
Among the trophic substances independent of nutrients are the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon and various growth factors, contributing to the maintenance of a eutrophic gut mucosa.	0.41499403417055847
We investigated 88 Patients with a total of 102 angiographically diagnosed intracranial aneurysms by means of transcranial colour coded Duplex sonography (TCCD) during a time period of 15 months.	0.6124592354845608
Both the size and teh localization of teh aneuryms were determined.	0.3376223826957306
Seventy aneurysms (77%) with a diameter of 16 +/- 8 mm (6-55mm) were detectable, with excellent visualization in 36 (42%), moderate visualization in 34 (40%), and no sufficient visualization in 16 (16%) aneurysms, respectively.	0.8181371807485032
In another 16 cases (16%) there was no sufficient vone window.	0.6076854773133777
Thrombotic material inside the aneurysm was detectable in 16/20 cases (75%), visualization of coil embolized aneurysms in 12/25 patients (48%).	0.5444173323328803
TCCD allows the follow up of cerebral aneurysms, with the detection of thrombosis and treatment effects after embolization.	0.7697033630518794

Scientific interest has so far focused on the follow-up of glaucomatous optic nerve head damage.	0.5526374691516187
As parameters such as cup depth and cup volume can be reproduced with a high degree of accuracy, this new instrument may prove to be an excellent tool to follow up swelling of the optic disk.	0.6526357869412235
Evaluation of three patients, aged between three months and five years because of failure to thrive and persistent diarrhea revealed the diagnosis of small bowel bacterial overgrowth.	0.6420112182302804
A combination of a typical history, endoscopy, laboratory, radiological and histological methods as well as the breath hydrogen test were used.	0.6625018008581977
All patients had preexisting intestinal disease: two (former premature infants) had been operated several times because of necrotizing enterocolitis including resection of larger parts of small bowel.	0.6773382315603372
The third patient was suffering from pancolonic Hirschsprung's disease.	0.349686349896871
All patients gained weight and reported less complaints after antibiotic treatment with metronidazole.	0.37391548812684755
Discussion: Small bowel bacterial overgrowth has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of failure to thrive, especially in cases with preexisting intestinal disease.	0.730247192062195
The diagnosis may be substantiated by a combination of indirect methods.	0.42758145672853315
Direct bacteriologic analysis is difficult.	0.16672631615399588
Usually, antibiotic treatment leads to a good weight gain after a short period of time.	0.5541458122610013
In contrast to carotid endarterectomy, the indication for vertebral surgery is not standardized.	0.6679707462385438
In a prospective study including 44 patients, it was investigated whether extended diagnostics help in making the decision as to whether operative treatment should be given.	0.8015150561415831
The diagnostic procedures included DSA, CCT, MRI, 24 h ECG, otoneurological, and neurological examination, and ultrasonic flow measurement.	0.6253407618346465
We compared the diagnostic results before and after surgery with the subjective symptoms of the patients.	0.7040712744933793
Two different surgical procedures were used: transposition of the vertebral artery to the CCA or graft implantation between CCA and atlas loop.	0.5453197472044622
In the follow up period (6 - 9 months), 72% of the patients had improved or were without complaints.	0.9691652544023225
The validity of the applied diagnostic parameters relating to a successful operation were disappointing especially the ultrasonic flow measurement.	0.4718757483721774
In our opinion, exact anamnesis and sufficient angiography are decisive for the indication of vertebral surgery.	0.49941741631870723
It has long been a goal to develop a means to measure squint angles in three dimensions simultaneously.	0.48331969007688214
A three-dimensional binocular method is naturally needed especially with surgical procedures that affect three dimensions of ocular motility.	0.459192692166263
In situations of depressed myocardial function, the role of immunological mechanisms has been studied recently.	0.5447966634800693
In different pathophysiological situations, such as chronic heart failure, open heart surgery with extracorporal circulation, cardiac transplantation, myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, patterns have been described with elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and reversible myocardial dysfunction, which may represent a final common pathway.	0.7415003743788678
The available data suggest a modulation of important determinants of pump function, i.e., contractility, preload, afterload, and heart rate, by cytokines.	0.6271268555181287
Potential mechanisms include the -adrenoceptor- and nitric oxide pathway, as well as a direct impact on intracellular calcium homeostasis.	0.6769984787359993
Interventional strategies based on this understanding are beginning to emerge.	0.40953616396800113
A prospective randomized study was designed to determine the effect of postoperative water contact on tissue healing.	0.6006480884115438
A total of 121 patients undergoing open hernia repair was divided into two groups.	0.4286019199546875
The first group was permitted to shower postoperatively, allowing the wound to come into direct contact with the water, the second group was instructed to keep the incision dry.	0.5410226266555695
Water contact, wound healing and patient satisfaction were assessed.	0.4827654689581055
There was no difference in wound healing between the two groups and no manifest infection.	0.7099161374999639
In children and adolescents motor/vocal tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior are known to be closely related.	0.520989581973972
Thereby, a continuum of symptoms ranging from single tics to a mixed picture of tics/rituals/obsessive-compulsive traits to clinically relevant obsessions and compulsions could be described.	0.4268540348057752
As neurobiological substrates dysfunctions in corresponding cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits (sensorimotor circuit in tic symptomatology, orbitofrontal circuit in obsessive-compulsive behavior) were postulated.	0.4002915657861054
For both disturbances behavioral therapy can be used to improve control mechanisms to counterregulate tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior, respectively, and psychopharmacological agents can be administerd to compensate dysbalances in neurotransmitter systems.	0.567984386663055
In case of a mixed symptomatologic picture it is necessary to include interventions for both pols of the symptom-continuum in the therapeutic programme to achieve extensive improvement as a basis for a further positive development of the patient.	0.6165031394154695
As laparoscopic cholecystectomy becomes more established, interest in legal aspects increases.	0.3927723669550506
The legal cases dealt with in Germany since the introduction of this laparoscopic method in 1989 were studied to determine the legal consequences of complications.	0.45093099399346587
Of 40 cases, 16 were judged to be cases of malpractice, whereas 24 were not.	0.5402479427751222
The most common cause was injury of the common bile duct (26 cases).	0.7169015173892015
Seven of these 26 cases were judged to be cases of malpractice, 2 of these as grave errors.	0.5456464695499479
The main reasons for the acceptance of a case as malpractice were delay in changing to conventional cholecystectomy, delayed revision, laparoscopic revisions and not reverting to conventional cholecystectomy in unclear situations.	0.5964870570292427
Purpose of this review is, to highlight key issues in transplantation medicine today and to summarise basic information on current state of perfused organ transplantation.	0.5949449671704025
There is special emphasis on ethical and legal considerations with regard to living donor transplantation, brain death concept, donor consent and organ allocation.	0.5161678477765016
Transplantation frequencies and the impact of whole organ transplantation on the treatment concept for patients with end stage organ disease is heavily dependent on donor and organ availability.	0.5465818102936298
Organ donor rate of 25 to 30 donors per million inhabitants per year seems to yield sufficient organ supply for patients on renal replacement therapy.	0.3966012945451813
15 to 20 liver transplantations per million inhabitants per year, my be sufficient, to cover the need of organs for non malignant end stage liver diseases.	0.5479240842497448
This frequency my be achieved by increasing donor rates and employing "split techniques", where one liver is used for two recipients.	0.5541948184166651
One year graft survival in kidney transplantation can be expected to be between 85 and 90 %, one year patient survival in heart and liver transplantation can be expected to be beyond 80 %.	0.6618356677732644
The risk of organ failure is highest in the first year, long term results are dependent on incidence of chronic rejection, comorbidity of the patient and original disease.	0.8864381210152592
Patient- and/or graft loss after the first year is in the order of 1 to 5 %.	0.820046670438597
Whole organ transplantation for kidneys, hearts and livers are considered routine procedures, lung transplantation is reaching standard phase, pancreas and combined pancreas kidney transplantation is well established technically, but its indication is still controversial.	0.5352271962174836
Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) is a promising method of treating different types of tumors.	0.5968601704859263
To increase the effectiveness of LITT, a new thermo-controlled application system for minimal invasive intervention was designed.	0.6344698570130024
This laser system consists of a laser applicator 3 mm in diameter, insertion equipment and an Nd:YAG laser source.	0.4986561710011819
The power of the laser source is controlled dynamically by thermosensors in a water-cooling system of the laser applicator.	0.579012807384005
In in vivo experiments in five pigs, within 10 min we found homogeneous coagulation regions in the liver that were of 3 cm and 5 cm in diameter.	0.6092189960663267
Via ultrasound we observed in real time the increasing coagulation zone that appeared as a hyperechogenic halo.	0.4375979083723742
However, due to perifocal edema, the real coagulation area was smaller than detected by ultrasound.	0.5137436149547459
Macroscopically and microscopically, the coagulation zones showed well-demarcated borders of the coagulation lesions, and the surrounding tissue appeared vital.	0.7509001881610734
The reparative reaction after irradiation was early fibrosis.	0.23245133227313522
In the course of 4 weeks, the surrounding scar capsule, containing fibrocytes, biliary ductules and collagen fibers enlarged.	0.5318642977997909
As a result, the coagulation necrosis became more and more fragmented between collagen fibers and was largely resorbed.	0.5630643981629946
The absence of complications in our animal experiments suggest that the technique of thermo-controlled laser light application is safe and useful in therapy for metastases that are not resectable.	0.6003807693556363
Attachment theory, originally developed by John Bowlby, becomes increasingly relevant in the field of psychotherapy (research).	0.4648018595449423
This review starts with a definition of central concepts and hypotheses of this theory and summarizes results regarding the development as well as correlates of attachment, mainly from research in developmental psychology.	0.4974408208939449
Related to adults, attachment theory has to be reconceptualized which is done in another part of this paper.	0.5855413888625428
Finally, some common methods for the assessment of adult attachment are described which play an important role in clinical studies (these will be the content of the part 2 of this review).	0.7428832871360876
Inflammation-mediated osteopenia is an animal model for bone mass reduction following chronic inflammation.	0.4565563620189954
We found a reduction of calcitriol serum concentrations during the inflammatory process, in addition cytokines are increased.	0.754072063767873
Treatment of the animals with calcitriol is able to prevent bone mass reduction and to preserve bone formation.	0.5313274235593773
Anxiolysis with drugs and psychoprophylaxis are both recognised methods of preoperative preparation.	0.29378220238259617
The beneficial effects of anxiolytics, however, appear to be difficult to prove.	0.49266363570157595
In this study a comparison was made of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol levels.	0.7533927887146747
In group I 19 children recieved only psychological treatment, while in group II 21 children received 0.2 mg/kg midazolam orally.	0.7088132138474555
Measuring points were directly before medication, 30 min afterward, and at induction of anaesthesia.	0.716548932635809
During the observation period the patients (5-10 years old) remained calm.	0.7921769766215471
At the beginning of the study the parameters of all patients were within a normal range; 30 min after premedication the HR and BP were significantly higher in group I than in group II.	0.9170542718758894
In contrast to group I, epinephrine levels in group II were lower at the beginning of anaesthesia than before premedication.	0.639997246082174
In both groups, norepinephrine levels were the same at induction of anaesthesia as before premedication.	0.48243685245363527
Cortisol decreased only in patients who received midazolam.	0.8325894421517925
HR, BP, as well as humoral stress parameters indicate that midazolam in a dose of 0.2 mg/kg orally is sufficient to reduce preoperative stress in children.	0.5348244011702499
A case of isolated right ventricular myocardial tuberculoma with pericardial effusions is presented.	0.49927184972737265
The diagnosis of myocardial tuberculoma was initially suggested by echocardiography and later by magnetic resonance imaging.	0.5424449676113712
The diagnosis of cardiac tuberculosis was confirmed by demonstration of tubercle bacilli in the pericardial fluid.	0.4223778066012091
This is a very rare condition which is usually diagnosed only by necropsy.	0.7005222420226419
Myocardial tuberculoma should figure on the list of intraparietal masses visualized at echocardiography.	0.27879113687655505
The incidence of hepatitis A infections has decreased due to improved hygienic conditions in Germany.	0.5026569644423973
However, hepatitis A is one of the most important diseases imported to the country.	0.6989286129365492
Currently, more than the half of all registered hepatitis A infections are acquired in foreign countries.	0.632150446064591
According to the decreased morbidity over the past few decades most younger people (age below 50 years) are not immunized and, subsequently, this age group is at higher risk during exposure in foreign countries.	0.7651396629911521
Therefore, a hepatitis A vaccination is recommended before travelling in countries with a higher incidence of hepatitis A (Southern Europe, Africa, South America, and Asia).	0.6081316903429613
Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are a group of Gram-positive organism, which have in common a fermentative metabolism with lactic acid as the major end-product.	0.7180716614231587
Except for bifidobacteria, the LAB are phylogenetically closely related.	0.46975754867681574
They directly contribute to human well-being as they are the most important germs in the production process of fermented foods which constitute one fourth of our diet.	0.5904939318722913
They are, furthermore, an essential component of the mucosal flora and especially of the intestinal flora.	0.7240462716455034
The genus Streptococcus contains highly pathogenic species which can be clearly differentiated from the useful germs.	0.4594838974982501
The intestinal flora contains such species of the genus Lactobacillus that are also important in food fermentation and species which are strongly adapted to the intestines and therefore, can be found exclusively in this ecological niche.	0.5300809788880094
A special status characterises bifidobacteria and enterococci.	0.32478791877558194
The former are located in a separate phylogenetic branch and also occur virtually exclusively in the intestines.	0.47415196464683146
Enterococci are rather ubiquitous, participate in indigenous food fermentations, are found in the mucosal flora and are counted as opportunistic pathogens.	0.48573245813800797
To influence the intestinal flora and to achieve health promoting effects LAB are isolated from the intestinal flora, grown and employed either as pharmaceutical preparations or additions to food (usually fermented milk).	0.4619543235840925
These bacteria are termed "probiotics".	0.2980795777330747
The exposition of consumers to high numbers of germs belonging to one or a few species needs an evaluation of their safety for human health.	0.4357749868728233
In this process the traditional experience with the safe nature of the species can serve as an important criterion.	0.6482743570008227
In front of this background, LAB in probiotics can be considered to be especially safe, nevertheless some restrictions have to be made.	0.588319531550495
Generally, the germs used should not contain genes encoding transmissible resistance to antibiotics.	0.44201554004053134
In addition they should not produce biogenic amines (e.g.	0.23945942179894578
histamine, tyrosine or phenylethylamine) and should not degrade mucine.	0.5246600158978414
The assessment may also include the following: absence of a potential for deconjugation of bile salts, induction of platelet aggregation and binding to fibrinogen and fibronectine.	0.47472555996243765
These examinations may be required as certain LAB have been identified in clinical isolates.	0.5729385967571939
The isolates were, however, obtained in the most majority of cases from debilitated patients.	0.5310841196919336
The germs were components of the body flora as well as of the environment, organisms deliberately employed in food fermentations or probiotics have never been isolated.	0.5975099112260186
Dural sinus thrombosis is not uncommon.	0.28716215814999163
Due to the nonspecific symptomatology, as well as the manifold etiology, clinical diagnosis may be difficult.	0.7265640324890059
In these cases imaging procedures are frequently crucial in deciding how to proceed and how to treat.	0.522609761823919
The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of helical CT in the detection of dural sinus thrombosis.	0.6218241203667185
In 20 patients with clinically suspected thrombosis CT angiography was performed.	0.658682148505603
In 6 patients dural sinus thrombosis was diagnosed.	0.48336569647322036
In order to acquire also arterial vessels, a short delay of about 22 s after the onset of the application of contrast medium was selected.	0.7036753908397045
By this method we found an occlusion of the MCA in two patients with clinically suspected sinus thrombosis.	0.789183488495169
In all patients the transverse slices and the multiplanar reconstructions showed filling defects or an "empty delta" sign.	0.5226727341976205
With irregular outlines the thrombus could be depicted over the complete course of the sinus.	0.5347328765153252
The MIP reconstructions were particularly helpful in the evaluation of the vessel anatomy and the pathological collateral venous drainage.	0.5424967752263834
In three patients MR angiograms were available for comparison.	0.5354665084021526
The smaller veins, such as the v. vermis inferior, were less clearly depicted than in CT angiography.	0.5919177407763158
CT angiography is a fast and reliable method to exclude or verify a sinus thrombosis.	0.5042644847392611
It can be performed immediately after non-enhanced CT.	0.6565327472601112
According to our present experience CT angiography is sufficient for the diagnosis of a sinus thrombosis.	0.7508123876389031
Coronary angiography ist considered to be the most important component in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.	0.7776346964627023
Only the lumen may be visualized using contrast radiography of the coronary arteries, however.	0.5755841157835366
With intravascular ultrasound, on the other hand, pathological changes in the vascular wall can be recorded.	0.638483312103542
Despite typical symptoms, an angiographical image of the coronary arteries is sometimes unable to show unambiguous stenotic lesions of the coronary arteries.	0.6290513183472777
In such cases, intravascular ultrasound provides a new complementary diagnostic tool for detecting even early forms of arteriosclerosis or angiographically underestimated coronary findings.	0.4797302082601795
Two cases are used to illustrate this.	0.6206735788199724
In those, angiographic visualization of the coronary arteries was unable to produce an unambiguous finding despite typical clinical symptoms, yet intravascular ultrasound could detect considerable arteriosclerotic wall changes.	0.4952412288778671
Purpose: The pontine micturition center plays a central role in regulating the micturition reflex, but the precise neural mechanisms are unclear.	0.6434452249105956
The cerebral cortex is involved in coordinating micturition but there is little knowledge on specific evolutionary higher brain regions.	0.4586056265258027
The present study aimed to investigate whether cortical activation during micturition can be demonstrated by EEG power spectra patterns and to explore whether specific cortical regions involved in the interaction of inhibition and release during the micturition reflex can be discerned.	0.5539515623883349
We also aimed to test whether intravesical electrostimulation (IVES) therapy in patients with micturition disorders has an effect on patterns of cortical activity.	0.527693230805619
Background: Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy represents a severe, potential vision-threatening disease process that requires close interdisciplinary cooperation for treatment.	0.43149215672804847
In general, any therapy has been dis-cussed controversially in the literature.	0.4473276045710671
Based upon experiences with spinal cord trauma, high-dose steroid therapy is recommended initially to minimize secondary consequences following orbital trauma.	0.573286942019343
The usefulness of surgical decompression of the optic nerve has been confirmed in several studies but is still not recommended in principle.	0.6812685123973373
In recent years there has been an increasing incidence of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) in otherwise healthy adults.	0.6681893916805072
It is characterized by fever, rash, hypotension and early shock with consecutive organ failure and a mortality rate of about 30 %.	0.5536159525324791
This paper describes the history of two patients with severe streptococcal TSLS.	0.7367346429379803
Various aspects of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapy are discussed.	0.9059960730437013
Only early, aggressive and repeated surgical debridement can reduce the bacterial load and decrease circulating exotoxins and thereby, in combination with antibiotic therapy, decrease the high mortality of this entity.	0.6395007666898702
Purpose: To test, whether axial, coronal and sagittal MIP and MPR reconstructions of diagnostic quality can be obtained from 1-mm collimation MSCT data of the chest for the evaluation of thoracic anatomy and pathology.	0.6883739296602105
The risk to health posed by a sedentary lifestyle is a problem of our times.	0.43947748781515994
In contrast to the previous assumption that only fairly high-intensity sporting exercise undertaken over a minimum period of 20 min produces health-related benefits, recent studies have shown that even everyday activitites (climbing stairs, brisk walking and cycling) can have a benedicial effects on health, particularly in those who take little exercise.	0.6057679512847198
So now the recommendation is: exercise of moderate intensity lasting 30 min at least 5 times a week, corresponding to an energy consumption of about 150 kacl/day or 1000 kcal/week.	0.40255334958000977
The results of experimental studies on sport and arthritis and sport and osteoporosis point to the advisability of taking up or maintaining an active sporting lifestyle.	0.4747786226336524
For one thing, it can be assumed that a moderate amount of movement does not increase the risk of developing arthritis: for another, sporting activity during early and late childhood produces a high maximum bone mass, therby delaying the development of osteoporosis in later life.	0.5848267546844026
The new guidelines on the extent and intensity of health-giving exercise make it easier to advocate exercise and sport for disease prevention and health promotion because they appear to implement.	0.49266094865284704
More difficult, however, is deciding on a suitable method for motivating inactive individuals to increase their level of physical acitivity.	0.48196032056809585
A model that has proved effective in smoking cessation programmes, and one that can also be applied to exercise counselling (transtheoretical model), can help in the selection of an appropriate counselling strategy.	0.69944917481547
Depending on whether an individual is inactive, or sporadically or regularly active, each one employs his or her own strategies primarily to maintain this lifestyle.	0.49316452342015793
Assuming that the counselling is adapted to the level of activity, the patient's attitude and behaviour can be influenced both more effectively and more economically.	0.6960515443312414
Background: Photorefraktive keratectomy (PRK) is the most frequent refractive surgical procedure worldwide.	0.7092924205552075
The central corneal thickness is reduced due to removal of the anterior stroma, including Bowman's layer, with a laser beam.	0.7505524257647556
This procedure results in considerable alterations of the corneal structure.	0.41591934353462795
What does this mean for the mechanical properties of the cornea?	0.5130669128379249
Beginning in the 1920s Wilhelm Reich developed the fundamental concepts of a body-oriented psychotherapy out of psychoanalysis.	0.4095661226767054
He started from considerations of egopathology, sexuality and the analysis of resistance and character patterns.	0.420769174340701
Characterological and bodily attitudes were understood as defence-patterns against emotions, which function not only psychologically but also bodily.	0.4219709706671695
Thus he began to mobilize repressed affects through working on muscular tensions and bodily expressions.	0.25772942880519206
That way their meaning in the person's history could be understood and a self-healing process restarted.	0.46731867772688734
This approach to release constrained energy is still valid for neoreichian schools such as bioenergetics, biodynamics, biosynthesis and others whose understanding of human nature and of healing processes is similar to those of other schools of humanistic psychotherapy.	0.4565286222901049
Bodily processes are used as indicators for the processes and successes of therapies.	0.47827035259974565
Besides there are impulses in modern body psychotherapies to work with the body in the relationship and transference process and attempts to reintegrate psychoanalytical concepts.	0.49259683150063405
Recurrent phlebothromboses in young patients with subsequent severe postthrombotic syndrome and chronic venous leg ulcers may be caused by underlying hereditary disorders of hemostasis or may occur as part of other congenital syndromes.	0.47454974082029827
The most common hereditary disorders of hemostasis in this respect appear to be deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S, and activated protein C resistance (mutations of factor V).	0.6879299698155419
Less frequently, dysfibrinogenemia, increased plasminogen activator inhibitor levels, or deficiencies of tissue plasminogen activator or heparin cofactor II may be found.	0.5310926001881081
Klinefelter's syndrome and homocystinuria are prime examples of those rare congenital disorders indirectly associated with an elevated risk of thrombosis in young individuals.	0.5392251051155516
Early diagnosis of these disorders will allow timely treatment, preventive care and counselling of patients as well as family members.	0.6079791206580775
Epidurography with contrast medium is used to verify the correct poition of an epidural catheter and to detect malpositioning.	0.5430213196832525
There is great variability in the distribution of contrast medium according to the individual morphology of the epidural space and the way it is injected.	0.704407407723003
Results of investigations of the anatomy of the spinal canal and epidural space performed with anatomic specimens, epiduroscopy, and conventional and computed tomographic (CT) epidurography are sometimes contradictory.	0.5469520961620418
We have performed CT epidurography in approximately 30 patients to date.	0.4814721837228039
Insights regarding the distribution of contrast medium in the epidural space can help to interpret conventional epidurographies and to explain special features, such as the "rail-road-track phenomenon" or the plica mediana dorsalis.	0.6568150581468543
Patients scheduled for major abdominal operations were studied.	0.31686231134889387
Catheters were introduced into the thoracic epidural space on the day before the operation.	0.5320919171883656
Conventional epidurographies were performed routinely after insertion of the catheters with a mobile X-ray apparatus, usually in the recovery room, using 5 ml iopamidol (Solutrast 250 M).	0.5845810799228288
Selected patients (good mental state and stable psychic condition), after written consent and with approval of the local ethical committee, were investigated with CT epidurography using the same contrast medium (partly diluted).	0.6508938461776513
From among the CT scans performed until now, five characteristic images are presented and compared to conventional epidurographies.	0.725072258081427
When small volumes (5 mL) of iopamidol were injected slowly, we regularly observed a railroad-track phenomenon in the AP images of conventional epidurographies.	0.675377970754858
After rapid injection of larger volumes (10 - 15 ml), the spread was more homogeneous and sometimes outline a lighter zone of contrast distribution in the midline.	0.6611541613003523
CT epidurography in these cases (5 out of 30 patients) revealed a plica mediana dorsalis.	0.8331112365687398
In the majority of the CT scans of the thoracic epidural space its anterior (ventral) compartment was unfilled by contrast medium.	0.6021168496503895
According to the findings of several investigators, dura mater and ligamentum longitudinale posterius have grown together, so that an epidural space does not exist in ventral thoracic segments of the spinal canal.	0.5756680832608095
In lower thoracic and lumbar segments both structures are separate, and a wide anterior epidural space was present and filled with contrast medium.	0.6660756734233251
In other cases the dorsal and dorsolateral epidural space was completely filled, but the contrast medium stopped behind the spinal nerves and surrounding dural sheaths, as if these structures, together with the connective tissue strands between them, formed a membrane that spread in a frontal plane.	0.5881332795113117
A railroad-track phenomenon is interpreted in the literature as the X-ray correlate of contrast medium spread in the subdural space, indicating an incorrect catheter position.	0.6243616657482987
According to conventional epidurographies and confirmed by CT scans, this feature is also seen regulary in cases with correct catheter position.	0.6908383562261783
Small volumes of iopamidol spread preferentially into the wider parts of the epidural space between the gaps of the vertebral arcs, whereas the dura mater and periosteal layers touch at the inner side of the pedicules and laminae, allowing the existence of only a potential epidural space.	0.5833420360477353
This rhythmic widening and narrowing of the epidural space is the explanation of the "railroad track" in AP contrast epidurographies.	0.5361692166752947
CT epidurography is a valuable tool to provide better insight into the morphology of the epidural space when filled with fluid (contrast medium, local anaesthetics), complementing findings using epiduroscopy and anatomic specimens.	0.5337850056198964
It stands to reason that this time- and cost-expensive method can never replace conventional epidurographies, but can help to interpret them properly.	0.7057790217867838
A 71-year-old woman suffered from pronounced erosion of her nose after soft X-ray therapy (total dose 28 Gy, half dose depth 10.5-11.5 mm).	0.710094688426304
5 weeks after the end of the irradiation no healing tendency was observed.	0.4635174416053095
This unusual clinical course was caused by a simultaneously existing pemphigus vulgaris that worsened after radiotherapy, presumably as a consequence of the release of epidermal antigens.	0.5513660201850142
In this case it is improbable that the pemphigus was induced by the radiotherapy, as has been reported on several occasions in the literature.	0.7287515196407336
However, this possibility cannot be entirely excluded.	0.544370774224755
A vascular etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been long debated.	0.4628508251154331
In order to search for an ischemic basis of PD we assessed the clinical symptomatology of a consecutive group of 60 PD patients and compaired their frequency of cerebrovascular risk factors, carotid atherosclerosis and ischemic brain lesions with age-matched groups of stroke patients and normals.	0.5338375687561004
There were 16 (27%) subjects with PD who also had symptoms of cerebrovascular disease.	0.5803375941355062
The frequencies of carotid stenoses, ischemic brain lesions and most of cerebrovascular risk factors seen in the latter group was comparable with those of stroke patients and significantly higher than in the investigational subsets of patients with "pure" PD and normals.	0.6912417530807623
Only one (1.6%) individual with PD presented signs suggestive of an ischemic etiology of parkinsonism.	0.6657622291202715
These findings suggest that cerebrovascular disease occurs in approximately one fourth of patients with PD, but seldomly is causally related.	0.6329981078682984
Neurological involvement is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sarcoidosis.	0.6913630678628917
The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of patients with neurosarcoidosis.	0.667223927728788
The MRI brain scans of 22 patients with sarcoidosis were retrospectively reviewed, along with the clinical information provided in the request form.	0.5310747797198213
All patients had signs and symptoms referable to the head and were examined with gadolinium enhancement.	0.7371402595810236
Cranial (facial) nerve paralysis was the most common clinical manifestation identified in 10 patients.	0.6901080144874605
A wide spectrum of MR findings was noted: periventricular and white matter lesions on T2 W spin echo images, mimicking multiple sclerosis (46%); multiple supratentorial and infratentorial brain lesions, mimicking metastases (36%); solitary intraaxial mass, mimicking high-grade astrocytoma (9%); solitary extraaxial mass, mimicking meningioma (5%); leptomeningeal enhancement (36%).	0.5747041073880708
The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis is often difficult, particularly so in patients who lack either pulmonary or systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis.	0.6383146927631788
MRI shows a wide spectrum of brain abnormalities associated with neurosarcoidosis.	0.32444626045224706
These findings, however, are not specific for sarcoidosis and one must consider appropriate clinical circumstances in arriving at the correct diagnosis.	0.621097184779698
In selected cases with isolated brain involvement, meningeal or cerebral biopsy may be required.	0.4713502127344275
In 1990, we first described the papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome (PPGSS).	0.38812429194017833
It is characterized by an itching erythema and edema of the hands and feet together with oral mucosal lesions and fever.	0.47091242179076204
The skin  lesions subsequently become purpuric and resolve spontaneously after a few days.	0.3692454620104886
In more than half of the patients, an acute parvovirus B 19 infection has been proven.	0.7447828240840123
In a few cases of PPGSS, other viral infections have been found, for example hepatitis B and measles.	0.8550270853072882
We report on a patient with PPGSS and review the literature.	0.6222703398550357
Fungus-bezoars in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of severe Candida albicans infection.	0.3945097223778402
A newborn infant with VACTERL-association suffered from fungus balls in the renal pelvis after Candida albicans sepsis, and developed a hydronephrosis with beginning postrenal failure.	0.43672770374990955
Following systemic antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosin as well as local irrigation with amphotericin B via percutaneous nephrostomy renal function normalised rapidly.	0.3893931388662494
Discussion: Since the incidence of systemic mycotic infection in neonates becomes more common the differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis should include fungus balls.	0.5896544563338594
Interactional understanding in psychoanalysis, especially the concept of the 'third point', suggests that the development of insight, empathy and relationship are dimensions of one and the same triangulating process peculiar to psychoanalytic understanding.	0.6082510375441773
In this context the psychoanalytic method, here understood as working with resistance, transference and countertransference, does not only offer a route to cognition, but also to the formation of a conflict-solving, egostrengthening, and supportive relationship peculiar to psychoanalysis.	0.6073205249794077
The formula 'interpretation on the basis of countertransference' describes a form of psychoanalytic interpretation that takes up this context intentionally and can thus also be used for crisis intervention in the case of neurotic conflicts.	0.502691390361203
This is exemplified by a case history.	0.5223108694656227
The Dutch Supreme Court ruled that in exceptional instances, physician-assisted suicide might be justifiable for patients with unbearable mental suffering but no physical illness.	0.386877142744801
A recent report shows that explicit requests for physician-assisted suicide are not uncommon in psychiatric practice in the Netherlands.	0.493680451638018
Some of those requests were granted and their medical background was described.	0.3316581952044158
Psychiatric consultation for medical patients who request physician-assisted suicide is relatively rare.	0.42036463899588183
Pemphigus is a rare intraepidermal autoimmune bullous disease.	0.5150699690705476
Two major variants, pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF), are distinguished.	0.5323764101855634
The aim of this study was to document the clinical and immunpathological findings in all pemphigus patients who were diagnosed in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Würzburg over the past 10 years.	0.7621662246115901
Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a significant complication of spinal anaesthesia.	0.6466300852852602
Diameter and tip of the needle as well as the patient's age have been proven to be important determinants.	0.8005006772713885
The question of whether post-operative recumbency can reduce the risk of PDPH has not been answered uniformly.	0.6145008810416902
And besides, some studies referring to this subject reveal methodical failures, for example, as to clear definition and exact documentation of post-operative immobilization.	0.6439179843419989
Furthermore, fine-gauge needles (26G or more) have not been investigated yet.	0.547470531180483
The first aim of our study was therefore to examine the role of recumbency in the prevention of PDPH under controlled conditions using thin needles.	0.5393586502451195
Secondly, we wanted to confirm the reported prophylactic effect of needles with a modified, atraumatic tip (Whitacre and Atraucan) by comparing them to Quincke needles of identical diameter.	0.5148524899036271
Most of the former investigators compared Quincke with atraumatic needles of different size regardless of the known influence of the diameter on PDPH.	0.5868014373401046
Three characteristic developments in modern western societies usually are considered to be independent variables in the ethical discussion:...	0.4196375432041378
Background: Neuropathic pain syndromes may be treated by intervention at the sympathetic nervous system.	0.6149891478157856
The pain in these syndromes is therefore called sympathetically maintained pain (SMP).	0.4100745433917784
Typical disorders with a SMP component are complex regional pain syndromes (reflex sympathetic dystrophy and causalgia), traumatic neuralgias and herpes zoster.	0.41867828947862806
The tendency towards sphincter-preserving resection for distal rectal cancers has led to a revival of the technique of coloanal anastomosis (CAA) in recent years.	0.6092341172358028
In order to improve functional results, creation of a colonic J-pouch in conjunction with a coloanal anastomosis (CPA) was proposed.	0.5791085493174273
Two different operation techniques exist: i) Double-stapling with the anastomosis close to the dentate line and ii) intersphincteric resection with the anastomosis located immediately at the dentate line.	0.5888224068987313
A long rectal remnant after double-stapling leads to urgency in 15 % of the patients due to stool retention in the atonic remnant.	0.5580393719869032
No propulsive motility patterns were recorded from the pouch which is emptyed passively by upper colonic peristalsis.	0.30953236714408644
Therefore colonic pouches should be fashionned of descending colon and should not exceed a length of 6 cm in order to prevent stool fragmentation.	0.5046403710216243
Under these conditions the average stool frequency is reduced from 2-6 /d after CAA to 1-3 /d after CPA.	0.7097576101881117
This effect is maximal during the first postoperative months, but is still significant after 3 years.	0.8895066512500938
Colonic pouch construction also leads, due to better blood supply and prevention of pelvic hematomas, to a significant decrease of the anastomotic insufficiency rate from 10,0 % after CAA to 5,4 % after CPA.	0.7721500113461105
Therefore creation of a colonic J-pouch should be combined with coloanal reconstruction if the oncologic situation allows a sphincter-preserving procedure.	0.37817707818247387
Background: Workers in the construction industry carry an increased risk for head and neck cancer due to the high consumption of alcohol and tobacco plus exposure to occupational carcinogenic or co-carcinogenic agents.	0.5981174420096356
These latter substances include asbestos, tar products, metal dust, wood dust, cement dust and paints.	0.3143180334051229
Presently, there are no well-defined standards for documentation of echocardiographic studies.	0.735853530937144
Nevertheless, standards are essential to provide comparability of data and to realize electronic communication, both essential for quality management in echocardiography.	0.6469604126678405
Embolia cutis medicamentosa (Nicolau Syndrom) is a very rare complication of intramuscular injections which presents with extensive necrosis of the injected skin area.	0.5920447710500046
Intra-arterial and/or para-arterial injections after prior perforation of certain vessels are discussed as possible pathogenetic mechanisms.	0.5239415286711192
We describe the occurrence of embolia cutis medicamentosa after intra-articular injections into the knee.	0.5202631196835886
In a 30-beds-unit of the Orthopedic University Clinic in Bochum for an example we studied the frequency of combined injection therapy with local anesthesia and chirotherapy in a one year period.	0.5556529960701777
There have been done 191 injections into ileosacral joints as well as 28 injections into facett joints of the cervical spine and additionally 315 into facett joints of the lumbar spine.	0.4689638330061248
On the other side there have been done 122 chirotherapeutic maneuvers at cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine by senior doctors with education in manual medicine.	0.5816745888517809
The injection therapy however was done in mean predilection sites of the patients suffering from cervical spine disorders or low back pain, the chirotherapy was done in other spine areas.	0.6567317674378836
The growing number of doctors with an education in manual medicine seems to improve the chirotherapy of the mean pathology as well, but it is not able to reduce the number of local injection therapy.	0.6944294934947656
In a retrospective case control study at the University of Frankfurt, Germany, 101 babies born to opiate-addicted mothers were identified from birth charts from 1988 to 1995.	0.5412499446100163
After birth, they developed a withdrawal syndrome (neonatal abstinence syndrome).	0.5309286450272992
Fifty control infants and their mothers were selected from neonatal wards.	0.3822854876062025
The group of opiate-exposed babies was subdivided into a group born to mothers without methadone treatment (n=48) and a group born to mothers who were enrolled in a methadone program (n=51).	0.6207794190655727
The methadone infants had a significantly higher mean birth weight (2822 g) than children in the group without methadone (2471 g).	0.6579999463620957
The abstinence syndrome was much more intense in the methadone group (convulsions 47.1%) than in heroin-exposed babies without methadone treatment (convulsions 27.1%).	0.5492556799119263
Women in methadone maintenance programs lived in more stable socioeconomic conditions than opiate-addicted women without methadone substitution.	0.36106672599801903
Moreover, they cared significantly better for their babies: 81.3% of the methadone mothers visited their children on a regular basis and 90.9% cared adequately.	0.5645419603237994
The data emphasize the need in future research to look more closely at the role of methadone treatment programs in the development of opiate-exposed babies.	0.48685257194638976
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease of high penetrance and variable expression.	0.7178251946386575
Epidemiologic data on craniofacial manifestations are still lacking.	0.28485481406807694
Up until now 74 patients with NF1 have been treated at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the University of Hamburg.	0.631921663560647
Forty-two patients presented periorbital and orbital neurofibromas varying in extension and in the severity of findings of the affected site.	0.6810025812710706
Surgical therapy is mainly based on tumour reduction, frequently combined with face-lifting.	0.4613755971006077
In our experience neurofibromas of the neck tend to be pseudo-encapsulated, facilitating the preparation of the tumour.	0.6912666787420193
On the other hand, identification and preparation of diffuse infiltrating neurofibromas in the trigeminal nerve region are difficult and local recurrence must be expected.	0.43758907277708436
Objective: The revised Edwards-Duromedics valve was introduced onto the market in June 1990.	0.4189204385754204
In September 1993, the producer changed the name of the valve to TEKNA, which is a low profile, bileaflet, mechanical prosthesis with a self-irrigating hinge mechanism.	0.6713913921254769
The results of a prospective follow-up study after valve replacement with this prosthesis are presented.	0.8498041932588245
A granular cell tumor is one of the rare tumors of the esophagus.	0.6179485324706854
We present the case of a 65-year-old male patient, who was admitted to our hospital for an elective cholecystectomy.	0.741191998537148
In the routine diagnostic gastroscopy an intramural tumor in the distal esophagus was incidentally found.	0.5944976505320559
Repeated endoscopic biopsies did not reveal the histologic diagnosis, although endoscopic ultrasound invasion to the tunica muscularis could not be excluded.	0.5887124837437866
After indicating the operative therapy, the tumor was removed through a thoracoscopic approach.	0.613300072116419
The histologic specimen showed a granular cell tumor of the esophagus (tumor of Abrikossoff).	0.48448790330915176
Since the tumor grade was unknown, our therapy seemed to be justified because of the low risk involved in minimally invasive operative procedures.	0.6680488325054689
There has been much discussion and controversy in the literature on this subject, including the potential for malignancy and the correct therapy regime, with a general shift to conservative or minimally invasive treatment.	0.8521395999631945
The case is discussed with a review of the literature.	0.6824226400696324
This review deals with the differential diagnosis and treatment of critically ill neuromuscular patients.	0.5801776362944077
Acute muscular weakness may be a sign of newly acquired neuromuscular disorders or of an exacerbation of a previously existing disease.	0.5326877273416296
Typical features of the more common neuromuscular conditions are presented and the problems of neurocritical care delineated.	0.7730761130881404
The appropriate ancillary tests are presented.	0.2057825485576561
Psychiatric care for chronic schizophrenic patients has improved in recent years, but for severely ill patients, often with multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions and in great need of care, the situation remains unsatisfactory.	0.658226104195496
Community-based psychiatric care is limited and psychiatric hospitals are now cutting back on inpatient care.	0.46645689499830234
The quality of care that chronically mentally ill patients receive at independant psychiatric nursing homes removed from population centers is undetermined, and many patients end up in asylums or homeless shelters unable to provide for their psychiatric needs.	0.4619246881787726
Neither a reliable way to assess the needs of these complicated patients nor a scientific basis for therapeutic intervention exists yet.	0.47278665010751114
A diagnostic scoring system, recently published by Ohmann et al.	0.4563506759389773
in this journal, was validated by analyzing the clinicopathological data of a consecutive series of 2,359 patients, admitted for suspicion of acute appendicitis.	0.6354223607434558
The results of the scoring system were compared to the results of clinical evaluation by junior (provisional) and senior surgeons (final clinical diagnosis).	0.693597976545246
To assess the diagnostic ability of the score, the accuracy and positive predictive value were defined as the major diagnostic performance parameters; the rate of theoretical negative laparotomies and that of diagnostic errors served as the major procedural performance parameters.	0.7285143775323927
Of 2,359 patients admitted for suspected acute appendicitis, 662 were proven to have acute appendicitis by histology, for a prevalence of 28 %.	0.6051436629027288
The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the provisional clinical diagnosis were 0.50, 0.94, 0.77, 0.83, and 0.82; 0.93, for the score 0.63, 0.93, 0.77, 0.86 and 0.84, and for the final clinical diagnosis 0.90, 0.94, 0.85, 0.96, and 0.93, respectively.	0.7145231648413252
Of the main diagnostic performance parameter, the accuracy of the score was signifianctly better than that of provisional clinical diagnosis (P < 0.05, 2 test).	0.7287231659160929
The score yielded a rate of negative appendecomies and laparotomies of 14.3 and 12.3 %.	0.572073517706067
With respect to the rate of overlooked cases of acute apendicitis, the score demonstrated a superior performance, with only 6 cases missed (0.9 %).	0.714990237714332
However, the number of patients with acute appendicitis, including those with perforated disease, who were not identified by the score, was almost four times that of the final clinical diagnosis (245 vs 63).	0.8349264309614708
With regard to the main procedural performance parameter, the score resulted in a significantly smaller number of diagnostic errors than the provisional clinical investigator (P < 0.05, 2 test).	0.6368006731028959
The results of this study indicate that the diagnostic scoring system might be helpful when experienced investigators or additional diagnostic modalities such as ultrasonography are not available.	0.722555516894665
It may therefore be of value in the preclinical evaluation of patients with suspected acute appendicitis and may be instrumental as a quality control tool and in clinical guidelines.	0.6240799166264572
Purpose: The standards and regulations concerning the protection of patients and operator staff within the context of MRI are compiled.	0.612068106153351
Resulting consequences regarding physical parameters are evaluated.	0.2131402773944927
Replacement of the tracheal conduit remains an unresolved problem.	0.34089126241267365
The microporous material expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE) is suitable for tracheal reconstruction.	0.48546366206727737
The aim of our study was to improve the limited mechanical properties of this material by incorporating reinforcement elements and to examine the influence of these elements on host incorporation and epithelialization.	0.6453406201378608
In so dours ePTFE prostheses were reinforced with Ionomer cement and porous high density polyethylene (pHDPE) rings and implanted into the neck muscle of miniature pigs.	0.3144159228599733
One of these prostheses was epithelialized by a cell seeding technique and was thus placed into a tracheal defect.	0.4748510201616112
Results were examined grossly by endoscopy and than by light and scanning electron microscopy.	0.4057196281388629
The shapes of both types of prostheses showed a high stability.	0.4389462662770936
The reinforcement elements did not impair bioincorporation or the ability to epithelialize.	0.347617163391823
In vivo interposition of an incorporated and epithelialized prosthesis to a host led to cell differentiation.	0.3325050129745868
The improved biomechanical properties of the prostheses waid and the reproducible formation of epitheliums are important advances in the solution of effectively correcting tracheal defects.	0.4823123729556886
Primary infection with human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and HHV-7) during early childhood causes permanent latent infection, usually without any ill effects; only a small percentage of primary infections will lead to exanthem subitum.	0.6586955356424505
Like other herpesviruses, HHV-6 and HHV-7 can be reactivated at any time if host defence mechanisms become defective (e.g.	0.3761023633020322
in transplant recipients, AIDS, tumour patients).	0.43609831108468533
HHV-6 can be reactivated under such conditions and cause a variety of clinical problems, such as exanthems along with interstitial pneumonia or hepatitis for example.	0.4674917252800467
In addition, the reactivated virus may influence the course of autoimmune and proliferative diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Hodgkin's disease.	0.49788452002300193
While, HHV-7 may be associated with similar disorders, more systematic studies are needed to clarify the clinical implications and the pathogenetic mechanisms of both viruses.	0.5504202621202051
Pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC) is widely used for monitoring and optimization of hemodynamic therapy in critically ill patients.	0.555747582232301
Despite its widespread use there is no clear evidence that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by this approach.	0.7028583201672187
In contrast, it has been suggested that PAC might increase mortality.	0.63384243125596
Available data do not allow the definitive omission of PAC in medical intensive care, nor do they justify its widespread use.	0.49404867160678595
Possible reasons that might affect outcome are catheter-related complications and often misinterpretation due to insufficient knowledge about PAC.	0.5666361342702969
Open questions on the influence of PAC on outcome variables in critically ill patients have to be answered by conducting randomized controlled trials.	0.6177457760096003
Beforehand, knowledge about PAC has to be improved.	0.6237028417008234
As a consequence, PAC should be performed whenever a specific hemodynamic question arises that cannot be answered by clinical judgement or by less invasive means.	0.5403611395691811
It is important that the investigator be experienced in catheter placement and data interpretation to avoid harm to these critically ill patients.	0.460886859328583
A long-term goal of assisted reproduction techniques should be the development of methods which are able to replace the high-dose stimulation with gonadotropins in order to limit the costs and risks of in vitro fertilization treatment.	0.7059859042327682
The in vitro maturation of immature oocytes derived from follicular aspirates and the in vitro growth of early follicles isolated from ovary biopsies are discussed as possible alternatives.	0.5542738486075209
Both methods are able to shift the application of stimulating hormones from the in vivo to an in vitro level, but are today still far away from being established in clinical routine.	0.6474545766472282
The exact knowledge of the topographic anatomy of the urethra as well as the macro- and microcirculation of the penis [6] are the basics of reconstructive urethral surgery.	0.7139122199756156
Adherence to the fundamentals and principles of tissue transfer [5] are necessary to fascilitate conditions for successful treatment of the various disorders of the male urethra.	0.6947684490612402
Mutural description of the anatomy of the male urethra in conjunction with external male genitals is necessary because of developmental similarities as well as the close anatomical relationship.	0.5385173051390792
The arterial and venous blood supply of the urethra and the penis have to be taken into account if vascularized flaps from the penile skin or the prepuce are used in urethral reconstruction.	0.6270297097232844
The dual arterial and venous vascularity of the genital skin is of fundamental importance to a successful outcome of the operative treatment.	0.6652147136437092
The purpose of this article is, to summarize the relevant anatomical knowledge of reconstructive urethral surgery.	0.6797604075158327
In this study the course of osteochondritis dissecans at two often affected areas, the femoral condyles of the knee joint and the talus at the upper ankle joint, is evaluated by studying and comparing the medium-term outcome in 40 patients treated conservatively and 72 patients treated surgically by arthroscopy.	0.766845536589174
The criterion of assessment was magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which shows a close correlation to the arthroscopic stages of osteochondritis.	0.5018906819846071
The stages on MRI follow the morphology of the interface, i.e., the zone between the osteochondral fragment and the parent bone, on T1- and T2-weighted images.	0.5702969960513705
After 18 and 24 months there were no substantial differences visible on MRI between the two different treatment groups.	0.5993431154049469
In fact, in the majority of cases  (> 60%) the MRI result was the same in spite of the treatment that had been carried out.	0.9794066582128743
Arthroscopic treatment compared to conservative treatment resulted in a small percentage in a reintegration in the sense of upgrading on the MRI (36% to 30%); nevertheless, a disintegration could not be avoided in all cases (4%).	0.7245356563101443
In both treatment groups the age of the patient seems to play an important role in the course of osteochondritis, juvenile forms following a milder course than adult forms.	0.6003386862266321
The number of women with congenital cardiac disease, who mature into adulthood is increasing.	0.56664198198383
Unfortunately, there are no prospective data published about the relative risk of different forms of contraception for these patients.	0.6157335442119034
Most women with congenital cardiac disease can safely use oral contracetives, especially low-estrogen combination or progestin-only preparations, with the exception of those, who are at particular risk because of thrombembolic complications (especially in cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger reaction, rhythm disturbances), fluid retention (especially in reduced ventricular function and congestive heart failure), arterial hypertension (important in coarctation), infectious complications (endocarditis) or hyperlipidemia.	0.6215564353033751
Oral contraceptives should be avoided in patients at increased risk for thrombembolic events.	0.7422812690919199
Intrauterine devices are very effective, have no metabolic side effects and merely cary a small risk of endocarditis.	0.5649860473340867
Newer devices containing progesterone only may put the patients at a still smaller risk.	0.3722222879320408
Contraceptive subdermal implants (e.g.	0.1367838661494759
levonorgestrel) are used with good results in the United States for patients with contraindications to estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and may well become more widely accepted in patients in Germany in the coming years.	0.6951313906076516
Barrier methods can be used, but have a higher failure rate, which may be inacceptable in patients at risk (e.g.	0.771003649340757
Especially in Eisenmenger's, permanent sterilisation should be advised.	0.2889759412026429
Two groups of 15 patients each with disseminated intravascular coagulation in association with septic disease were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin  (lmw-heparin) in different dosages (group I: 1,5-5 IE/kg body weight (BW) per hour; group II: 8-15 IE/kg BW).	0.769805066277647
We studied the levels of D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (PTF), and global tests of coagulation like prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), thrombin time (TT) and platelet count, plasminogen activation (PA) and fibrinogen concentration to estimate the success of heparin therapy in the two groups.	0.5958005140251985
TT and fibrinogen concentration were not suitable to follow the course of the coagulation disorder.	0.621428984593208
PT, PTT, platelet count progressively PA, D-dimer, TAT, and PTF normalised progressively after heparinisation.	0.5114865731525085
However, only the last three parameters were sensitive enough to show different effects of variable dosages of lmw-heparin.	0.582390923363435
D-dimer, TAT, and PTF levels declined in proportion with heparin concentrations, and thus appear to be the most useful parameters for monitoring the therapeutic effect of heparin in septic coagulopathies.	0.6880201383086912
In patients with acute or chronic myocarditis, arrhythmias are a common and often the only clinical symptom in the natural course of the disease.	0.7007088572216817
The potentially malignant tachy- and bradyarrhythmias are of particular significance in the differential diagnosis of sudden cardiac death in myocarditis.	0.6012933942009123
Factors responsible for the increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias are structural changes, parameters of ventricular dynamics and vascular changes.	0.5510190339980023
On the one hand, inflammatory processes in the cardiac myocytes and interstitium can lead directly to fluctuations in membrane potential.	0.4722303510643201
Fibrosis and scarring of the myocardial tissue and secondary hypertrophy and atrophy of the myocytes favor the development of ectopic pacemakers, late potentials and reentry as a result of inhomogeneous stimulus conduction.	0.5157854448573252
Furthermore, parameters of ventricular dynamics such as increased wall tension, increased myocardial oxygen consumption and diminished coronary reserve in the case of disturbed systolic or diastolic left ventricular function also contribute to the increased incidence of arrhythmias.	0.5823591999110338
Lastly, vascular factors can further increase the arrhythmogenicity of the inflamed myocardium through the disturbance of micro- and macrovascular perfusion and the resulting myocardial ischemia.	0.6155173387747984
Non-invasive rhythmological evaluation by 24 h Holter ECG, measurement of ventricular late potentials and heart rate variability can be used for orienting risk stratification of the at-risk patient with myocarditis.	0.6287481727429933
Programmed atrial and ventricular electrophysiological stimulation also has a relatively high predictive value for spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	0.5754112829052568
It should be emphasized that, at the present time, optimal electrophysiological parameters with a high predictive value do not exist.	0.6574718616272546
In a selected patient population, immunosuppressive therapy in addition to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy can lead to the reduction or complete suppression of spontaneous and inducible arrhythmias.	0.6193905547482528
Nevertheless, in the interim, further precautionary antiarrhythmic measures such as serial antiarrhythmic treatment, VT ablation and AICD implantation are necessary in patients with malignant cardiac arrhythmias.	0.6087114724412777
Right ventricular myocardial biopsy for demonstration or exclusion of myocarditis is an important additional examination which can improve the differential diagnosis and treatment of patients with cardiac arrhythmias of unclear etiology.	0.6896717912493294
Aim: To investigate the distribution of collagens in experimental microvascular surgery.	0.6945423551438739
Material and methods: Autografts (4 mm) of the left common carotid artery in 20 Wistar rats were harvested up to 4 weeks after surgery.	0.7706029287567431
The specimens were investigated immunohistochemically for the demonstration and distribution of collagen III and IV.	0.5223702538586568
Results: The demonstration and distribution pattern of collagens was a function of the accuracy of each single suture.	0.6939767328016706
In the intima, the organisation and amount of collagen IV was directed to the lumen and dependent on the distance and vitality of the vessel segments.	0.5657182361354435
The media had in its axis direction the lowest reparative potential for regenerating the continuity break.	0.31792773845393996
The adventitia formed a thick cuff around the anastomosis, in which collagen III and IV-positive vasa vasorum had grown in a circular fashion.	0.5844420470818957
The marked myointimal hyperplasia in the area around the anastomosis and in the entire autograft was made up of collagen-positive extracellular matrix.	0.6124338517717365
Conclusions: Our results support the demand for a careful and atraumatic suture technique in microvascular surgery.	0.5568991350265095
The identification of collagens in rat vessels is a valuable tool for studying wound healing in experimental microsurgery.	0.5198806800954843
We treated 8123 patients with invasive malignant melanoma were treated up to 1995.	0.3675450605324417
2200 had invasive melanomas with less than 0.75 mm Breslow thickness; of these, 45 developed metastases.	0.5848250613796029
Three had second primary tumors with greater thickness.	0.29745282995888944
One case showed metastasis from another tumor.	0.3578863231092601
In two cases the metastases were not ascertained histologically.	0.6534897228307148
The remaining 39 cases showed some peculiarities: a greater proportion of late and of internal (as contrasted to regional) metastases.	0.5750699092500512
Most of these primary tumors had a Breslow thickness of more than 0.5 mm and were Clark level III or even IV.	0.6816556902875341
Male patients and primary tumor sites in the area of head and neck were significantly over-represented.	0.5239981358821659
In this paper the question is considered to what extent the patient's and analyst's perception and tolerance of both aggressive and destructive elements of the analytic relationship can be increased.	0.749718640363488
Successful interpretation enables the patient to feel, enact and comprehend animosity in the transference and experience that the relationship can continue.	0.4458394211086611
The concept of primary aggression developed in Freud's speculation on death instinct is discussed in its clinical function of relief.	0.5063753433994049
The metapsychological concept of primary aggression facilitates work on aggressive and especially destructive developments of the relationship.	0.4280428683174789
Freud's and subsequently Eissler's examination of the reciprocity of destructiveness and narcissism opened plausible clinical avenues to explain the compensation of defence mechanisms against mankind's vulnerability in the face of mortality.	0.41428051757882134
The concept of primary aggression is obviously of greater relevance than frustration/aggression models since the former does not view the patient as mere victim of his biography, but as a subject with the potential to enact his own destructiveness.	0.5368587918429585
Since aggressiveness is often concomitant with fear and suppressed guilt, interpretation plays a decisive role in relieving the superego strain; more confrontation may involve the analyst in the role of the persecutor.	0.4466915155507967
Sudden and violent feelings of hate towards the analyst require careful treatment of the patient's irritation.	0.6216428346736769
Interpretation of genetic causes of animosity often prove to be countertransference resistance; interpretation in transference, however, is viewed as profitable.	0.4425818162565716
Finally, those dangerous and destructive phases of treatments are discussed, which compel the analyst to protect the setting.	0.5891804674118947
Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral agent of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children throughout the world.	0.6662697399940904
Highest hospitalization rates are seen in the second and third month of life.	0.7191951457335932
Young infants, especially those with predisposing conditions such as prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic lung disease (CLD), congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis or immunodeficiency, are the pediatric patients at increased risk for severe RSV disease.	0.6314835405134579
Specific therapeutic options for RSV are limited.	0.3689033232164195
In this prospective study we investigated the efficacy of microcatheter spinal anaesthesia in comparison with a combined spinal-epidural technique in trauma patients.	0.7035140206362195
Background: In Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain and Italy, the OPHTEL project combines clinical centers of ophthalmology and internal medicine, an institute for medical informatics and health services research, a publishing company and different industrial partners in the EDP market.	0.5305778042978645
Purpose: A prospective study was initiated for the correlation of the findings in the initial cranial CT with the long-term follow-up MRI in children with severe head injury.	0.8155085897270432
Another aim was the evaluation of frequency and location of lesions, found only in MRI.	0.5225572178730786
A differentiation is made between patient information on findings and diagnosis, patient information on avoidance of known dangers, and patient information on the risks involved in a particular intervention that has been selected.	0.694369206097481
If no information is given on the risks inherent in a patient's condition and how she must proceed in order to ensure that they do not come about, this is considered to be a treatment error, and in these circumstances the intervention is then legally seen as bodily harm.	0.8160419920507447
Information on the risks involved in an intervention must be given in good time, which generally means on the day before the operation.	0.7022596291503409
An exception is made to this rule for day surgery.	0.3816991331764987
The patient must be informed about treatment alternatives when the method selected is not the method of choice or when there is an alternative offering equivalent chances but risks of a different kind.	0.7283412221005372
Such information is given to the adult patient who is capable of legal transactions.	0.6607168120981318
In the case of minors or of patients who are not capable of legal transactions their legal representative is responsible for receiving the information [and making decisions].	0.5311128337246229
In the case of unconscious patients everything depends on "presumable consent to the operation".	0.4704242868133048
If a patient later cites lacks in the information supplied to her to support a claim for compensation in a situation where it would be unwise to refuse an operation, she must elaborate plausible grounds for being in conflict over the decision even following appropriate information.	0.4281744039662811
Within the last few years the use of Point-of-Care Analyzers increased.	0.6202452915204517
These testing is primarily performed in the emergency room, intensive care units, and in the operating room using small portable analyzers.	0.8453260941308441
The fact of being transportable and working with rechargeable or changable batteries and disposable cartridges caused us to use blood gas analysis in the prehospital setting.	0.38460017703779303
Patients undergoing major vascular surgery frequently require a substantial intraoperative fluid replacement to assure hemodynamic stability, which is in excess of the expected fluid requirements due to starving, blood and insensible losses.	0.5551797032370134
This leads to a positive fluid balance which can not be readily explained.	0.5971018521445128
The case of a 57 year old patient is reported, who suffered from an acute myocardial infarction with maximum CK and CKMB values of 821 and 84 U/l, respectively.	0.6421363127005911
The patient underwent bicycle exercise testing 9 days after a myocardial infarction in 25 W steps every 2 min starting with 50 W. The ergometry was interrupted at 125 W because of ST segment depression of 0.28 mV in V6.	0.518143902376578
Systolic blood pressure dropped to 55 mm Hg, combined with severe angina and shock.	0.5331616946526682
Volume substitution and catecholamines did not elevate blood pressure.	0.2678046352657052
Immediate M-mode and Doppler echo revealed a "stiletto"-shaped mitral regurgitation profile typical of acute mitral valve insufficiency.	0.5275862932441421
The transesophageal echocardiogram showed a distinct mass moving between the left ventricle and left atrium, diagnostic of papillary muscle rupture.	0.5372347735740395
Despite of shock, mitral valve replacement was performed successfully.	0.4452414706461513
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a papillary muscle rupture during exercise testing after myocardial infarction.	0.6103336076485238
The flow directed balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter introduced by Swann and Ganz 1970 has made possible the measurement of filling pressures in the heart and is extensively used in operating rooms, in catheterization laboratories and in intensive care units.	0.5347847936044171
The rupture of the pulmonary artery is an uncommon complication associated with a high mortality rate exceeding 50 percent.	0.8299464811256847
Main symptoms are cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea and cardiac shock.	0.387900320908407
Complications occur if guidelines for the safe use of the balloon-tipped catheters are not strictly followed: Excessive catheter manipulation, advancing the catheter tip too far peripherally and leaving the inflated balloon in the wedge position for long periods should be avoided.	0.4892418986861627
Patients with pulmonary hypertension as well as elderly and anticoagulated patients are at greater risk.	0.542143839602395
On 90 patients with 93 unstable fractures of the thoracic spine and the thoracolumbar junction we treated by a minimal invasive procedure between may 1996 and april 1998, in 46 patients an endoscopic splitting of the diaphragm was performed.	0.6903793787173872
The diaphragma was dissected at its attachment at the spine and the adjoining costal base.	0.42032715716375124
After partial corporectomy and discectomy, a tricortical bone graft has been inserted.	0.42202546832681315
An additional stabilization was done by using a plate and screw system.	0.6450660010675241
The incision of the diaphragm was closed by suturing or using an universal endostapler.	0.46904869304082514
Controlling the postoperative results a complete closure of the incision was documented by X-ray and CT-scan.	0.6464553252935955
There was no conversion to the open procedure or postoperative infection.	0.5883339729656172
Splitting the diaphragma opens also the thoracolumbar junction to a minimal invasive treatment and stabilization of fractures.	0.50244265722905

Practice has shown, however, that deficient operating room management as regards the instruments, implants, operating room staff, and surgical planning causes problems.	0.6296567721506
As a result of this, a prophylactic search for sources of error began (risk management).	0.5488650886491873
If the sources of error are found, described, and remedied, knee endoprosthetic surgery will be successful for both the patient and the surgical team.	0.7377776744640856
Cooperation and communication among manufacturer, surgeon, and surgical nursing staff should serve to minimize forensic risks.	0.5571323887451929
The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis since viable pathogen has been recovered from plaques.	0.34253873794446416
Chlamydiae are epithelial pathogens notorious for causing persistent infection.	0.16689947610312278
Atherosclerosis, however, is a chronic inflammatory disease involving mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall.	0.7669612109774806
A bacterial contribution to atherosclerosis appears more relevant if the resident mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall that constitute the plaque can support chlamydial infection continuously.	0.44005348761478785
The study consists of a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	0.8200241221372156
Besides medical and sociodemographic data, two personality factors - self-efficacy and locus of control - were found to predict postoperative pain.	0.7976310700638487
Self-efficacy describes the expectations of a person to successfully execute the behavior required to produce behavioral outcomes.	0.4616299596187698
Locus of control, in the extreme case, is a personality factor which is represented by an internal orientation in which the individual believes that rewards are brought about by his own action, versus an external orientation, in which the individual believes that rewards are the result of powerful others or chance factors and fate.	0.6536698668445134
We postulate that the two personality factors correlate with postoperative parameters of pain and that there are also multiple correlations between them.	0.6032649589158866
At present there is neither an completely inert biomaterial available, nor does a universal test exist which objectively evaluates biocompatibility.	0.3980147598260326
One reason is the individuality of the host, especially with regard to the inflammatory response.	0.7548995929234971
Inflammation was found to induce biodegradation by hydrolysis or auto-oxidation of vascular prosthetic matrix after implantation.	0.41231760247983784
The present study was performed to investigate the specific humoral immune response after implantation of segments of a collagen-impregnated polyester prosthesis (Dacron) in Balb/c mice on experimental days 1, 18, 38, and 322.	0.7324320586681791
Serum antibody detection was performed by modified enzyme immunoassay using the prosthesis as a target.	0.524400031173731
Specific polymer antibodies, enhanced by repeated implantations, could be detected in all mice which received grafts up to experimental day 322.	0.5502133666528655
These antibodies were not directed against the collagen coating.	0.4119570304818877
The antibody formation could be further enhanced by a combined administration of complete Freund's adjuvant together with the first implantation at experimental day 1.	0.4377479522724806
Results suggest that specific polymer antibodies, reflecting an inflammatory response, might be an additional parameter for biocompatibility testing of vascular prostheses.	0.4748177156485679
Twenty-nine unicondylar fractures of the distal femur were treated at the Trauma Center "Bergmannsheil", University of Bochum, Germany, between 1981 and 1994.	0.6655313230726154
All patients sustained their injuries from severe direct trauma.	0.29028638554016684
There were 16 lateral condylar fractures, 7 medial condylar fractures and 6 tangential posterior ("Hoffa-type") fractures.	0.6165742546728815
Twenty-eight closed injuries and 1 grade IIIB open fracture were included.	0.40358380593210424
Eleven patients sustained concomitant injuries to the skeleton.	0.3739445559684877
All fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with screws within 8 h of admission.	0.6330968846008531
Postoperative management consisted of early continuous passive motion and minimal weight-bearing for 6-8 weeks, progressing to full weight-bearing.	0.5326095887783558
The mean follow-up was 68 months (18-120).	0.7310027012391127
The therapeutic outcome (clinical result, radiographs) was rated by the Neer score.	0.6976043842024735
Twenty-seven patients were available for follow-up examination.	0.8012692898569935
Of these, 23 were rated as excellent.	0.4527798300647706
3 achieved satisfactory results, and 1 had an unsatisfactory result.	0.6782849077166584
All patients who did not achieve an excellent outcome had had accompanying injuries.	0.5261021190418763
Open reduction and internal screw fixation of unicondylar femur fractures provided overall excellent long-term results.	0.5155306545619573
The therapeutic outcome was significantly affected by associated injuries of the skeleton.	0.5561028273352565
The realization that a disease will not respond to a curative treatment causes massive fear and anxiety in affected patients, but also feelings of helplessness and insecurity in health professionals caring for the patients.	0.6029516685151168
The global fears of affected patients can be divided into three main categories of problems; stepwise mastering of these problems may help to maintain or restore an acceptably high quality of life according to the WHO guidelines for palliative medicine.	0.5727981382176257
In light of the anxiety felt by physicians and others caring for this patient group, palliative psycho-oncology must offer patient-centered holistic care in which the psycho-oncologist is not an isolated therapist but rather a member of a team made up of physicians, nurses, religious workers, psychologists, ergotherpists, physiotherapists, social workers, and especially family members.	0.5619673787748533
Together, this group of health professionals and family members caring for the affected patient form a group that itself receives care as needed.	0.5560539664087146
Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) with hepatic vein occlusion is a rare disorder that can effectively be treated in advanced stages with orthotopic liver transplantation.	0.6672586672226684
We report on 16 patients who received 18 liver grafts and were followed up for at least 2 years.	0.7151694923642633
In 7 patients a hematological disorder was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy.	0.5893810108654232
One patient died after 4 months due to cytomegalovirus pneumonia; another patient died after 2 years due to progressive liver failure after portal vein thrombosis.	0.6153867247887744
The actuarial 5-year survival rate is 87.5 % compared to 85.3 % in all other 710 orthotopic liver transplantations performed from September 1988 to December 1995 at our institution.	0.7280392303961987
Anticoagulation consisted of intravenous heparin and overlapping continuation with dicoumarin.	0.3193115783797509
Three patients received hydroxyurea for thrombocytosis, one patient for 1 week only early after the transplantation.	0.6044932622092011
Two postoperative abdominal hemorrhages required laparotomy.	0.1599913400461228
Two patients had to be retransplanted, one for thrombosis of the hepatic artery and portal vein after discontinuation of dicoumarin due to GI bleeding and one for hepatic vein thrombosis after insufficient dicoumarin intake.	0.5741527807493302
Terminal BCS represents a good indication for orthotopic liver transplantation; however, life-long, closely monitored anticoagulation is essential.	0.4517814504929678
Postmenopausal estrogen-replacement therapy maintains bone density as assessed by densitometry of skeletal sites relevant for future fracture.	0.3832354884633641
Optimal doses are 2 mg oral estradiol, 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens, 1.25 mg estrone and 50 µg transdermal estradiol.	0.4970721592751066
There is a role for calcium supplementation in individuals with non-optimal dietary intake of calcium.	0.5041442596375898
Observational studies suggest that estrogen replacement reduces the future risk for hip fracture by 25 %.	0.46875725179593436
Discontinuation of replacements is associated with an increase of fracture risk few years later.	0.6054247806942815
It is noteworthy that there is a lack of formal fracture studies providing data on the efficacy of estrogen replacement for primary prevention of osteoporosis and for secondary prevention in terms of treatment of women with established osteoporosis, with a diagnosis based on WHO criteria.	0.6444408117968086
Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, and tibolone, a synthetic steroid with weak estrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic properties, may constitute alternatives to estrogen-replacement therapy.	0.5864458658755349
Raloxifenen maintains bone density in and reduces vetebral fractures by some 50 % in women with prevalent osteoporosis.	0.6363795988478296
Artificial insemination from donor (heterologous insemination) is a rationally based treatment in complete male infertility.	0.4750330909146214
In this overview the enlarged knowledge on semen donors, the receiving couples and the development of the offspring will be summarized.	0.5063603885733836
Although motivation of men towards semen donation is predominantly based on financial expectancy, most of the donors agree to offer the offspring not-identifiable information on biological and social characteristics.	0.42600749932296766
Semen donation does not enhance the risk of consanguinity and of genetic diseases in the population.	0.48607028005100217
The decision to undergo heterologous insemination is a burden for the couples.	0.4592920295439643
Retrospectively, however, the majority state positive influences of the insemination on their partnership.	0.5948201057019509
The most important question is whether they should disclose the insemination to the children.	0.5497788202665163
The course of the pregnancy and the postnatal development of the children do not differ from those of children of natural procreation.	0.7163120330719615
They receive more love and care than "usual" children.	0.28884588857043525
Their rights concerning the insemination, however, are poorly considered.	0.46829259854073507
If we agree that the knowledge of genetic descent is part of human rights, non-disclosure of the donor insemination to the children raises severe ethical problems.	0.44286925321017784
The extended field of view imaging procedure named "SieScape" provides, for the first time, a mode of establishing in real time a sonographic picture up to 60 cm in length.	0.5801987646300368
This allows the display of large organs or tumors as well as large areas of the body in a single view, without having to assemble several pictures.	0.6363467178078605
Furthermore, pathological find-ings can be shown in full size in their surroundings.	0.44132054637335694
This method makes it considerably easier to convey sonographic results to the therapist who is not present at the investigation and to control a finding, for instance a tumor, during therapy.	0.6259189966281445
Heart rate variability (HrV) has been established as an important risk parameter in patients surviving myocardial infaction.	0.6984054124601144
Recently, analysis of HRV - particularly of the standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) - from short term ECG recordings has been proposed as an alternative to that from 24 hour Holter monitorings.	0.728297516479635
The present study is the first to compare SDNN from short term recordings to that from 24 hour recordings with respect to risk stratification after myocardial infarction.	0.6973493997546933
In 60 patients at the time of discharge from the hospital, SDNN from Holter monitoring averaged 93  +/-  30 ms compared to 39  +/-  18 determined from short term recordings.	0.6789735296054862
Patients with a prospectively defined clinical endpoint differed significantly from those with an uneventful course with respect to age, left ventricular ejection fraction, mean RR interval from Holter recording ( 753  +/-  153 vs 921  +/-  132 ms), mean RR from short term recording (783  +/-  153 vs 914  +/-  163 ms), and SDNN from the Holter recording (71  +/-  27 vs 97  +/-  29 ms; p < 0.001) However, patients with and without clinical event could not be seperated by means of SDNN measured from short term ECG registrations (35  +/-  22 vs 41  +/-  19 ms; P = NS).	0.6848717630166
Thus, SDNN measured from short term ECG recordings does not seem to be useful regarding risk stratification of patients after myocardial infarction.	0.6162227913255007
Analysis of HRV should be performed using 24 hour Holter monitoring, which provides more information and reflects circadian fluctuation in autonomic tone.	0.6258635517120082
Glomus tumors (glomangiomata) are benign tumors arising from glomus cells.	0.5362545421538413
Multiple glomangiomata are less frequent and less painful than the solitary variant, which is usually located subungually.	0.6627954760616637
Nonetheless multiple glomangiomata - sometimes being sensitive to pressure and changes in temperature - may cause considerable discomfort.	0.6660235337667152
Treatment of multiple glomangiomata is problematic because of the often large number of tumors.	0.5747622437905392
Sclerotherapy represents an alternative to surgical and cryosurgical therapy.	0.46404835956480756
We report on sclerotherapy in a 35 year old female patient with multiple hereditary glomus tumors.	0.6652435360648896
Conventional echocardiographic methods of measuring left ventricular mass (LVM) are limited by assumptions of ventricular geometry and image plane positioning.	0.530985420618838
Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography offers a promising new approach for more accurate determination of LVM.	0.43386523323999804
This study was performed to compare LVM measurement by one- (1D), two- (2D), and 3D echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients (pts) with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).	0.8464555034603053
Determination of Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) can be performed through washout methods, indicator gas dilution or bodyplethysmography.	0.4816431494931949
Some of these techniques have been adapted for use in intensive care patients whilst being mechanically ventilated.	0.8063560914802509
However, most measurement setups are bulky, cumbersome to use and their running costs are high.	0.4997909477511916
Hence FRC measurement has not become a routine method in intensive care although it offers considerable advantages in the management of ventilated  patients such as the determination of "best PEEP", the detection of progressive alveolar collapse in the course of acute lung injury and during weaning from mechanical ventilation.	0.5890803448344519
Up to now most efforts to improve and simplify FRC measurement were made at the expense of accuracy.	0.45778563358261176
An ideal method ought to be accurate, easy to handle and cost-effective.	0.5118027549929138
It should supply not only FRC data but also information about intrapulmonary gas distribution and dead space.	0.3550378032852164
These demands can be met using modern data acquisition software.	0.3010033180110747
The pros and cons of all methods available for FRC measurement are discussed in view of their suitability for intensive care patients.	0.5989527505441139
A conventional nitrogen washout using emission spectroscopy for measurement of nitrogen concentration gives satisfying exact values for the determination  of the parameters mentioned above.	0.5238082503582632
The measurement error can be lowered under 5% by special corrections for flow and  nitrogen signal (delay and rise times, changes of gas viscosity).	0.528182281498407
For flow measurement a normal pneumotachograph can be used.	0.5036481087854631
Using a laptop computer for data  acquisition the bed-side monitor fulfills most of the demands in intensive care.	0.40527030009941023
It is then also possible to measure indices of intrapulmonary gas distribution such as Alveolar Mixing Efficiency and Lung Clearance Index.	0.388068479829357
Three strategies are followed in handling the key issue within the field of action of care and services for the elderly: securing the material needs of those requiring care, creating appropriate care structures, and providing an effective counselling back-up to alleviate interface problems.	0.5572868320348386
Thouse latter, process-oriented aids, have been the subject of discussion and further development under the key term of case management for a good decade.	0.7105505638970713
The aim in this context is to prevent the elderly from being unnecessarily moved into residential care, to stop the revolving door syndrome, to ensure that older people can stay in their homes, to support family members acting as care providers, to enhance the quality of services and those to ease the strain on fund providers.	0.6564218843784779
In the context of case managment, these diverse tasks are performed by three basic substantive functions: the gatekeeper, broker, and advocacy functions.	0.5673047174875223
Each of these three functions characterizes the main variants of case management with a different weighting (care management, community care, managed care and case management as a counselling approach with a particular focus on individual help).	0.5482243660530114
Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a bullous autoimmune disease of the elderly; it is characterized by tense bullae on both erythematous and otherwise apparently normal skin.	0.5918351572031074
Several clinical variants of BP have been described, and we now add our observations of two BP cases mimicking subacute prurigo.	0.5383855287428
Both patients had suffered from intensely pruritic excoriated papules for several months before presentation.	0.4408367046154121
Blisters had never developed and did not occur during follow up.	0.5063221921263625
Histology showed changes of chronic dermatitis.	0.2940163527401774
In the serum of both patients, indirect immunofluorescence on NaCl-separated human skin revealed the presence of circulating antibodies binding to the roof of the artificial blisters.	0.5315711491223889
Perilesional skin biopsies showed linear IgG or C3 deposits in the basement membran zone.	0.3305839477105667
Immunoblotting of epidermal and dermal extracts demonstrated the binding of the antibodies to an epidermal 230-kD protein, which is the known major bullous pemphigoid antigen.	0.5675469102306981
These cases are described as a basis for discussion of the clinical spectrum of bullous pemphigoid.	0.7627704807034317
The distal metatarsal osteotomy according to Magerl allows correction of a hallux valgus deformity by lateral and plantar displacement as well as by pronation and varisation.	0.4670530271184043
The length of the first metatarsal can be adjusted by the depth of the cut at the resection or by a slightly oblique osteotomy.	0.6585065550513235
If necessary, soft tissue release and/or a osteotomy of the first proximal phalanx can be done to relocate the sesamoids under the head of the first metatarsal.	0.7224746969967323
A review of 118 foot operations in 75 patients demonstrated a very good or good result in about 75 %.	0.6101387560181893
Radiological examination showed sufficient lateralisation of the metatarsal head.	0.3335845664551881
Evaluating the length of the first metatarsal and the amount of variation, the results were less satisfying.	0.9321408865990926
The metatarsophalangeal angles could be corrected by 14  ° and the intermetatarsal angles by 7  ° on average.	0.5203328107953638
The sophisticated operative procedure limits the use of this technique as a standard procedure.	0.6973410801501073
The contribution of Rudolf Virchow to dermatology seems to have been forgotten, or present-day dermatologists are not aware of it.	0.5219570591076605
The present historical review is intended to show that Virchow's thoughts and the terminology created by him are still alive.	0.472072476803597
The report encompasses a short biography, including Virchow's nonmedical activities.	0.4804770826422186
It starts with early experimental publications, which laid to the foundation for his fame, and with dermatological studies of his early period.	0.6195435180494165
This is followed by a detailed description of his contributions pertaining to dermatology in his largest work, "Cellularpathologie".	0.5730789022326102
Special mention is made of Virchow's lasting contributions to medical, and particularly dermatological, terminology.	0.5043178005658888
Finally, his historical studies, his latter small publications on topics in dermatology, his pupils and scientific friends, and the social-political and anthropological activities of later years are discussed.	0.6016211932096943
Thus, a multifaceted picture is painted of a still modern pathologist who has influenced dermatology in multiple ways.	0.4551771981492622
Starter's pistols are often bought for self-defense, but can also be used for criminal activities (e.g.	0.6071890539428436
assaults, etc.).	0.24476371167265734
When a starter's pistol is loaded with blank cartridges and is fired, a powerful shooting noise results.	0.4174746966591534
The level of the noise produced is high enough to cause acoustic trauma.	0.46819253452620274
For legal examinations and giving an expert opinion further information is needed about the power of such noise.	0.4479446362815917
We examined how high peak sound pressure levels were of the gunshots of blank cartridges and whether there existed any directional characteristics from the noise emissions.	0.40944475604991387
In all, 15 different models of starter's pistols of 8 different calibres were examined.	0.44837205913687167
In addition to blank cartridges, 8 mm tear gas cartridges were also examined.	0.5702631364561024
Four transducers were situated in the horizontal plane around the muzzle: 0 ° (shooting direction), 45 °, 90 °, and 180 ° (towards the firer).	0.6435232592822483
The distances between the transducers and the muzzle were 25 cm, 50 cm, 100 cm, and 200 cm.	0.5857646983350753
At a distance of 1 m and in the 0 ° shooting direction the peak sound pressure levels of nearly all weapons tested exceeded 160 dB.	0.5346905206840835
At a shooting distance of 25 cm the peak sound pressure levels reached 181 dB.	0.36808988397167497
In addition, we observed a directional characteristic concerning the emission of noise: pistols produced higher peak sound pressure levels to the front than backwards towards the firer.	0.5130485823891731
Owing to their rare incidence, foreign body injuries in the region of the orbit, skull base and skull have up to now mostly been treated in  the literature by means of case reports.	0.6479561838545806
Here we present our experience and treatment regimen for ten patients we have treated during the last 3 years.	0.7517328764254106
In seven cases the foreign body was located in the orbit alone, whereas in three others the orbit and the frontal base were equally involved.	0.6339049670316019
Except for one case, the foreign material could be removed completely.	0.6798221138282645
Three patients suffered from partial or complete loss of vision and one patient developed a psychosyndrome during the follow-up period, but no late effects were registered in the remaining six cases.	0.808706080324818
Before removing the foreign body and carefully reconstructing the accident, however, we strongly recommend the documentation of possible functional deficits, preferably by means of photography.	0.5501989588623957
CT is the method of choice for localising the foreign body, except for the depiction of wood particles.	0.6642267181118451
Here, sonography and MR should be performed.	0.5746111309441072
As the therapeutic approach, the cooperation of an interdisciplinary team of ophthalmogists, neuro- and maxillofacial surgeons seems mandatory.	0.6635869146500937
To avoid inflammation, the immediate removal of the foreign material is recommended in cases with considerable intracranial lesions: post-operative neurologic and intensive care monitoring should be provided.	0.7350476317974097
Treatment is completed by high-dose antibiotics, using CSF-soluble substances and, if necessary, anti-convulsives.	0.6474843487715523
Rocuronium is a new nondepolarizing muscle relaxant for which a fast onset has been described.	0.586455508112782
The goal of this study was to examine whether the characteristics of rocuronium could make it an appropriate relaxant for the anaesthetic management of operations of intermediate duration such as endoscopic upper airway surgery.	0.529458193098248
These operations, which require the anaesthesiologist and surgeon to "share" the patient's airway, require good muscle relaxation for endotracheal intubation and placement of endoscopic instruments.	0.7169151346955374
In addition, the time course of neuromuscular blockade and its relation to the quality of intubating conditions were analysed.	0.6658573877792003
Patients and methods: In order to better define the potential advantages and risks of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), we designed a prospective study including 73 eyes.	0.6302746418751654
Treatment of tachycardic atrial fibrillation (AF) is difficult in patients with congestive heart failure because many drugs which exert negative dromotropic effects (beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists) may depress ventricular contractility and/or decrease arterial blood pressure.	0.5676349638489926
We have identified 2 intravascular sites in the superior (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) where parasympathetic nerves, which innervate the atrioventricular node, can be stimulated electrically.	0.6089349621756277
In 8 dogs, a 7-F catheter with an expandable electrode basket at its tip was non-fluoroscopically positioned in the SVC and in the proximal IVC (time for positioning: 3-5 minutes).	0.6836355252188978
High-frequency electrical parasympathetic stimulation (PS) with 20 Hz at an impulse duration of 0.1 ms was performed during pacing induced AF.	0.6157121544291169
Results: With increasing stimulus strength, a graded ventricular rate slowing was observed during PS in the SVC and IVC (P<0.01, ANOVA).	0.6496828489004044
The negative dromotropic effect started instantaneously after onset of PS and ceased immediately after termination of PS.	0.3837491789437462
During ventricular pacing at a constant rate, no decrease of the arterial blood pressure was observed during PS.	0.8567446320330209
PS in the IVC yielded significantly lower stimulation thresholds than in the SVC.	0.5322025174778812
Conclusions: Transvenous parasympathetic stimulation for ventricular rate control during AF can easily be achieved in the SVC and IVC in dogs.	0.5114084264959706
This procedure may provide a foundation for investigating the usefulness of PS in humans.	0.4542741760944858
If the results translate to patients, PS may be very beneficial in the treatment of AF in patients with congestive heart failure.	0.5012776113658759
A total of 86 patients suffering from fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were followed up after an average time period of 57 months (12-98).	0.7264249933836507
Of these patients, 56 were treated operatively and 30 conservatively.	0.7107093711496341
According to the AO/ASIF classification, 66% of the operated group were fractures of type A, 29% of type B, and 5% of type C. All patients were operated on by means of dorsal locking instrumentation with pedicular fixation and, apart from six patients, with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting.	0.9131219072638191
The conservative group was treated according to the guidelines of Böhler with closed reduction, plaster cast, and rehabilitation program.	0.6177303747773896
All fractures in the conservative group were of type A.	0.7091204310110979
Charcot foot in its original sense is equivalent to stage 4 of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) which is known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease since 1886.	0.541713153312567
This entity, which can be subdivided into 3 groups including subgroups, predominantly begins during childhood and progresses slowly.	0.5726561010449163
The first symptom, often unnoticed by the patient for a long period, is weakness of the intrinsic foot muscles with consecutive hammer-toe formation and mobile pes cavus.	0.7355348020150889
Progredient atrophy of the peroneal, extensor, tibialis posterior and finally triceps surae muscles leads to fixed pes cavus varus excavatus with severe varus deformity of the hindfoot, secondary varus position of the talus at the ankle level and subsequent arthrosis of the medial compartment.	0.5581240014061882
Permanent varus deformity of the ankle almost invariably leads to stress fractures of the malleoli because of repetitive microtrauma (stage 5 of HMSN).	0.57959179152959
The alveolar adenoma of the lung is a rare benign tumor in which the normal parenchymal architectur is imitated by a proliferation of both the alveolar epithelial cells and the mesenchymal septal cells.	0.7473038753037635
The first description, based on six cases, was published in 1986 by Yousem and Hochholzer.	0.5561553288862676
From their ultrastructural findings they presumed a type II pneumocytes differentiation of the epithelial cells.	0.5432539650684529
We investigated an alveolar adenoma of the lung immunhistochemical by means of antibodies against apoprotein B and C of human surfactant.	0.5397944847753415
Both the lining cells and the macrophages in the alveolar-like spaces were stained.	0.5590590983633005
The septal connection tissue cells did not react.	0.26875495023374274
These findings confirm the expression of surfactant constituants and, hence, the differentiation into type II pneumocytes of the epithelial cells of the alveolar adenoma.	0.6783315885857286
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in women, whereas it is rare in men.	0.8629613936284561
In our own case series the ratio is 175 : 1.	0.5531101421735004
The present paper deals with an evaluation of clinical and morphological findings from a series of 54 de novo male breast cancers observed in our institution from 1978 to 1996 and a comparative discussion of 528 female breast cancers from the same geographic area.	0.601687337223075
We should like to focus on the following observations:	0.5353022221302249
Patients with congenital varicella syndrome develop cicatricial skin lesions and microphthalmia.	0.44855223955696105
An overlap in the clinical manifestations exist with a specific genetic disorder, called MIDAS syndrome.	0.5526647862749933
It is due to a partial deletion of the short arm from chromosome X, with consecutive monosomy Xp22.3.	0.6714147778940251
The rapid development of recombinant DNA technology and our enhanced understanding of the genetic basis of human disease has facilitated the development of new molecular therapeutic modalities, termed gene therapy.	0.5449114017602616
Gene therapy involves the transfer of functional genes into somatic cells and their expression in target tissues in order to replace absent genes, correct defective genes, or induce antitumoral activity in the tumor-bearing host.	0.6069816382616798
Currently, an increasing number of gene therapy strategies are being investigated in experimental and clinical trials.	0.6207835976963576
Despite substantial progress, a number of technical and logistical hurdles must still be overcome before gene therapy can be safely and effectively applied in the human patient.	0.5544382306218623
Since gene therapy involves complex cell processing and can be time consuming and costly, simplifications or even alternative approaches will be necessary in order to establish this therapy as suitable for clinical use.	0.5462395347260451
This report reviews various gene therapy stategies and gene delivery techniques currently under clinical or experimental investigation.	0.33128254485909914
Special emphasis is given to cytokine gene therapy using gene-modified tumor vaccines for cancer treatment.	0.3837581498040563
Using the PTB simulator, which emits real signals from patients, we examined the precision of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement with the Dinamap 1846 (Critikon) and the HP M-1008B (Hewlett Packard).	0.6205243067017596
For this purpose we simultaneously registered invasive arterial pulsewave, cuff pressure and cuff pressure oscillations of 20 patients from our intensive care unit and stored them in the database of the simulator.	0.5648309789431173
The invasive reference blood pressure values were determined following the recommendations given by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.	0.5627278963920938
The invasive system showed a cut-off frequency of 35 Hz; the damping constant was 0.21.	0.5182564591416235
With 49 record signals from patients we carried out 15 simulated measurements each.	0.33190012630203763
From a total of 49 bio-signals from patients the Dinamap 1846 was able to process 41 signals and the HP M-1008B 47 signals.	0.4446632100750552
The mean error of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement of the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure amounted to -2.50 mmHg, 3.35 mmHg (P<0.05) and 1.51 mmHg with the Dinamap 1846 and to -8.5 mmHg (P<0.001), -5.15 mmHg (P<0.001) and -5.58 mmHg (P<0.001) for the HP M-1008B.	0.7884280209319781
The 95% confidence limit for the systolic, diastolic and the mean arterial pressure amounts to 56 mmHg, 30 mmHg and 35 mmHg for the Dinamap 1846 and 50 mmHg, 38 mmHg and 35 mmHg for the HP M-1008B.	0.5236543365776666
The differences between that two instruments could be caused by the different algorithms for the calculation of blood pressure values and different artefact detection and elimination techniques.	0.6002131378984379
The results of the performance tests we achieved with the PTB simulator correspond to the results of other clinical examinations.	0.6434248894862811
The American Association for the Advanecement of Medical Instrumentation recommends a maximum mean error of 5 +/- 8 mmHg.	0.5419143887959652
None of the examined instruments lay within these limits.	0.4691830826059668
Due to the systematic and stochastic errors, we think that the Dinamap 1846 (Critikon) and the HP M-1008B (Hewlett Packard) do not achieve performance levels that are adequate for measuring critically ill patients.	0.5267817153123008
Many patients consulting medical emergency services make the initial contact because of psychiatric emergency situations.	0.3618362707930774
However, emergency physicians and their assistants are usually not sufficiently experienced in psychiatry.	0.5432301543960393
Therefore, psychiatric emergencies are sometimes only reluctantly accepted or inadequately treated by these services.	0.4153365884092778
Our present contribution aims at improving this situation.	0.27063597049364096
It gives a review of the main diagnostic groups concerned, their symptomatology and psychopathology, and offers some advice with regard to empathic verbal interventions and counselling in those emergency situations.	0.6148030083895898
3 different types of complex spinal trauma are defined: Type I means a multilevel contiguous or non contiguous unstable injury, type II is described as a spinal injury with concommitant thoracic or abdominal lesion, typ III stands for the coincidence of spinal injury and polytrauma.	0.538626838780177
Overlapping of different types occurs.	0.4362821020630722
Type I: The incidence amounts according a german multicenter study to about 2,5 %.	0.7101469348642483
Multilevel injuries need to be stabilized for a long distance from posterior.	0.5692860811388583
With a thoroughful analysis the segments to be fused are determined.	0.397622972153766
Typ II: The leading thoracic injury is a lung contusion which occurs in up to 50 % of the cases.	0.6948620951257466
A CT scan of the thorax during the first diagnostic screening is recommended.	0.6210195150551356
Early reduction and stabilization from posterior should be aimed at.	0.3958367648282602
During the first two weeks anterior procedures are contraindicated.	0.676942490618324
Abdominal injuries are to be found in 3-4 % of all spinal injuries.	0.8760946784165857
All organs could be affected.	0.2262211560875916
A typical constallation is the "seat-belt syndrome" with lesions of the upper abdominal organs and a flexiondistraction injury of the upper lumbar spine.	0.6653074396688361
The main problem is to make the diagnosis of both components initially.	0.7018684762332692
Most of the patients may be treated in one operation by first taking care of the abdominal injury and than stabilazing the spine.	0.7923643537448212
The prognosis of this combination is favorable.	0.6198926865199579
Typ III: In 17-18 % of all polytraumatized patients lesions of the spine are to be diagnosed.	0.8795460765418747
From these only one third need surgical care.	0.39605212818748037
From 680 patients with operatively treated fractures of the thoracolumbar junction 6,2 % were polytraumatized according to the multicenter study mentioned above.	0.6594581696592966
The risk of missing a spinal injury in polytrauma totals approximately 20 %.	0.4237958192936401
Surgical stabilization should be performed in the primary phase (day-1-surgery).	0.8697404095905464
Additional injuries, potentially time consuming operations with a high blood loss sometimes necessitate a different approach.	0.6048188145615296
Non stabilized spinal injuries apparently do not have the same negative effect on the whole organism as long bone fractures.	0.6037613882769861
In the early phase of treatment on the C-spine only anterior procedures and on the thoraco-lumbar spine only posterior techniques should be applied.	0.6784900484866659
Experimental studies have shown that in traffic accidents with frontal impact the new airbag system can significantly reduce the incidence of severe injuries and fatal outcome.	0.5238917585505888
The question of whether the airbag itself induces specific patterns of injury needs further investigation.	0.5072650273256952
Two cases of traffic accidents with airbag protection are presented here.	0.49966052954233625
The first case report clearly shows the life-saving and injury-reducing effect of the airbag system in a traffic accident with frontal impact at 100 km/h.	0.555511815131825
In the second case only minor injuries of the face were diagnosed initially.	0.7409314075394159
Hemodynamic instability occurred after 3 h of hospitalization due to rupture of the azygos vein.	0.4609518332056364
Analysis of the presented cases shows that, besides the well-known benefits, there are certain injury patterns that seem to be related to the use of airbags.	0.7304363938073908
These have not been described before.	0.5312216232434076
It is concluded that patients who were involved in traffic accidents with airbag deployment have to be hospitalized and followed up carefully over time, even though they are initially stable, as potentially fatal sequelae of deceleration trauma can occur later.	0.6593881587473664
In our opinion it is not possible to estimate the severity of airbag-associated injuries with conventional methods.	0.744444653846786
A questionnaire with 78 questions concerning the situation of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) sufferers in Germany was distributed to a representative 3000 out of the more than 14000 patient members of the German AS society; 1614 patients (54%) responded.	0.6771619001223317
The age distribution of these patients roughly agrees with that expected due to the distribution of the age at diagnosis and the age distribution of the German population.	0.8700618806109524
The group of patients more than 65 years old is, however, under-represented.	0.6376082321462592
Introduction: Headache is thought to be generated by nociceptive processes within the meninges, followed by activation of trigeminal neurons within the brainstem.	0.4494204092292005
The noxious stimuli initially involved in these nociceptive processes are unknown.	0.31362031049299627
A preparation was developed in the barbiturate-anesthetized rat, in which the activation of trigeminal brain stem neurons by selective local stimulation of the dura mater could be observed.	0.639089759345583
Atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial disease of the arterial wall, dependent on genetic disposition and multiple other risk factors.	0.6320799778746307
There are probably several candidate genes, that determine the individual susceptibility of the vessel wall to develop atherosclerosis.	0.6400437630374856
In recent years, a growing number of gene polymorphisms, associated with an elevated risk of myocardial infarction, has been identified.	0.7794151119676208
These genes and gene clusters play a crucial role in lipid metabolism, regulation of blood pressure and clotting.	0.5568224166204606
In contrast to rare monogenetic diseases with severe clinical signs and symptoms (e.g.	0.45607093713100955
familial hypercholesterolemia), genetic polymorphisms are relatively frequent.	0.3375461032112665
Due to their frequency, there is a high probability that one individual carries several alleles predisposing to coronary heart disease.	0.6554793814850086
Genetic polymorphisms become clinically important by interacting with lifestyle, environmental factors or endogenous metabolic disorders.	0.34672228814346706
Fourty-nine patients with 50 complex acetabular fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation from August 1993 to February 1996 in a prospectively documented study.	0.5536090920121218
The fractures were fixed with small fragment implants through a modified extensile iliofemoral approach (Maryland approach).	0.4288824683782376
Thirty-seven patients were polytraumatized with an ISS of 20 pts.	0.5164767599760451
In 10 patients the ISS was > 25 pts.	0.6425628343575179
Good or anatomic initial fracture reduction with a fragment stepoff K 2 mm could be achieved in 48 fracturers (96 %).	0.5116031062446597
Thirty-six patients with 37 fractures could be evaluated after 25 months on average.	0.5033704537149449
In 28 fractures (76 %) the functional outcome was good or excellent according to the d'Aubigne and Harris scores.	0.6665672746152874
Radiological results were excellent in 21 fractures (57 %) and satisfactory in 12 fractures (Heeg score).	0.6448665402531825
In 7 cases (14 %) a postoperative subcutaneous seroma had to be treated surgically.	0.7208810367093069
No wound infections, however, were observed.	0.6442660082522885
Further complications were secondary a loss of reduction in 4 cases (11 %), relevant heterotopic ossifications (Brooker III/IV) in 5 cases (14 %), and aseptic femoral head necrosis in 2 cases (5 %).	0.7395508604066835
In two cases a total hip replacement (THR) for posttraumatic arthritis had to be performed.	0.7432897875751557
Two more cases are scheduled for THR due to symptomatic femoral head necrosis.	0.3309386214183351
A good joint reconstruction can be achieved through the modified extensile iliofemoral approach (Maryland) in complex fractures of the acetabulum.	0.6774163847686208
However, the approach related morbidity seems to be worrysome.	0.617081771045089
In complex fractures with comminution in the roof of the acetabulum the prognosis remains uncertain even in cases where initial anatomic joint reconstruction can be achieved.	0.5856074070932028
The discussion on the results of open spinal surgery, in particular, on complications as a result of open surgery, e. g., the so-called post-discotomy syndrome, has led to the development of less invasive methods, especially for treatment of lumbar disc prolapses.	0.7582666280049145
Percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are based on a variety of intradiscal diagnostic and therapy methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal spinal disc fenestration or chemonucleolysis.	0.543260046372648
Since the 1970 s, various methods such as mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures and, in part, endoscopic intradiscal procedures have been developed and also used clinically.	0.6511840484666467
The clinical results vary from 30 % good/very good results to almost 100 % good/very good results, depending on the author and study.	0.6199380839788371
It is obvious that not many prospective randomized studies using either conservatively or surgically treated control groups have been conducted.	0.4720704161188647
The results of these studies on intradiscal therapy methods are often analyzed more critically and with lower success rates than the partially retrospective studies of a single method, which often have large case numbers, but do not always meet the demanding criteria for scientific study design.	0.642749084632094
To attain good results, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only be used to treat select cases of lumbar disc disorders according to strict indication criteria.	0.6415617167647587
At the present time it can be concluded that, in comparison to endoscopic und microsurgical methods, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures must be restricted to a small number of cases.	0.6784773314493548
A 58 year old patient with hepatitis virus C (HCV) infection had a secondary polyclonal IgG-IgM cryoglobulinemia with a benign 20 year course.	0.4673381907786257
Clincally the patient suffered from progressive pigmented purpura (PPP).	0.2843276108931347
Histologic evaluation revealed a lymphocytic vasculitis.	0.24204105014149074
Food containing tartrazine trig- gered flares of the PPP, as demonstrated with controlled oral provocation testing.	0.4098709003076373
In most of the previously described cases of HCV and type III cryoglobulinemia, the typical cutaneus finding was palpable purpura with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.	0.5741961074053968
Normal aging is associated with changes in body composition, thirst perception, renal function, and the hormonal regulatory systems involved in the maintenance of water and sodium balance.	0.6557476409574101
The presence of many diseases and drugs common in the elderly can interact with the impaired homeostatic systems to result in clinically significant disturbances of water and sodium with accompanying symptoms, morbidity, and mortality.	0.5887252227302563
These disorders, which include dehydration, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, urinary frequency, and urinary incontinence can either be prevented or promptly recognized and appropriately treated by understanding the physiological changes and clinical circumstances which put the elderly person at increased risk for deranged water and sodium balance.	0.5906460712681659
Although valvular stenosis may be evaluated adequately by measuring transvalvular pressure gradients with Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization, these methods have failed to provide reliable and accurate quantification of valvular regurgitation.	0.5229491345656543
In recent years the development of magnetic resonance imaging has broadened the diagnostic spectrum in cardiology, since it allows assessment of ventricular volumes without geometrical assumptions and the non-invasive quantification of blood flow within the heart and great vessels.	0.6689463135371485
The purpose of this overview is to evaluate "established" diagnostic tools and to show the capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of valvular heart disease.	0.6773115791121127
Solvent induced polyneuropathy and encephalopathy have been acknowledged quite recently as occupational diseases in Germany.	0.34984312439188453
For compensation first of all the diagnosis has to be proven.	0.6226545911494443
For differential diagnosis other known causes as well as non-organic mental diseases must be taken into consideration.	0.3888532347029437
The causality between proven exposures and diagnosed disease has at least to be probable.	0.2975250390888954
To evaluate causation extensive experience of the experts is needed.	0.3850283136264197
In this context scientific criteria regarding neurotoxicity of the solvent, duration of exposure, individual aspects of non-occupational influences, time course of the disease are important within a thorough synoptic evaluation.	0.6427212338490136
Possibilities and limitations of sensitive diagnostic measures such as neurographic, neuropsychologic and neuroimaging examinations are discussed.	0.3503131217065563
The prognosis of toxic polyneuropathy and encephalopathy is in general favorable if exposure has stopped.	0.46441495166723096
Additionally, adequate therapy and rehabilitation measures are supportive for a good prognosis.	0.577057708665566
Standard radiography of the cervical spine is still the first imaging procedure applied in degenerative disease of the cervical spine.	0.61624224586617
Spondylosis deformans, osteochondrosis and uncovertebral arthrosis are well depicted by such images.	0.2932425895924871
Whether or not additional imaging is needed depends on the clinical symptoms.	0.6590890211296059
Special projections (anteroposterior oblique radiographs, lateral radiographs in flexion and extension) may be the next step.	0.6733159543732897
For many abnormalities, mainly of the intervertebral discs and the myelon, MR imaging has become the standard procedure, largely because of its multiplanar capabilities and its excellent contrast resolution.	0.6959644102116356
CT can be used instead of MR imaging if the latter method is not available, and its strength lies in the depiction of bone abnormalities.	0.7533412634209499
Scintigraphy is suitable for early detection of abnormalities with unclear clinical symptoms and may then indicate the correct level of the cervical spine for MR imaging or CT. Myelograms and myelo-CT can no longer be considered routine imaging methods.	0.5712561186507957
A number of imaging abnormalities are not strictly related to clinical findings and should therefore always be discussed in the clinical context.	0.804444270627749
We report on three years of experience with a new method of a simultaneous endoscopically assisted anterior release in the prone position, combined with transpedicular posterior scoliosis correction and fixation.	0.6536998293110251
In 60 cases this simultaneous approach yielded substantial advantages.	0.25749001646093184
True derotation of the apex - even in the thoracic spine - is achieved.	0.8810630550249935
In cases of total canalicular occlusion or the total absence of the lacrimal apparatus the functional restoration requires the repair of a newly created lacrimal system.	0.6026824736840007
The intraoperatively reestablisted lacrimal drainage from the conjunctival sac will be maintained by a plastic tube.	0.3610960421687718
Beside other criteria the influence of the used inserted materials polyethylene or silicone should be evaluated.	0.5020666080710612
A prospective, randomized and controlled trial is conducted to compare carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting in high grade symptomatic carotid artery stenoses.	0.46234511806686085
Magnetic resonance imaging is used routinely with much success for various problems in different medical disciplines.	0.468522275027196
However, the patient is exposed to static as well as to time-dependent magnetic fields and radio-frequency electromagnetic fields.	0.8166714313945372
In 1997 the Strahlenschutzkommission, the German Radiological Protection Commission, passed a recommendation on the use of magnetic resonance in medical diagnostics.	0.5764699204464585
In this recommendation basic values related to thresholds for physiological effects and limits for restricted and unrestricted use are given.	0.33494558037426936
In the following the aim and applicability of this recommendation are discussed, as well as the thresholds and different limits for the static magnetic fields, the gradient fields and the radio-frequency fields.	0.6089849314795044
Additionally, advice is given for the protection of high-risk patients, personnel, and the general public, together with further safety advice as well as recommendations for users and manufacturers.	0.7256391637040748
Six patients with granuloma faciale, including patients with multiple lesions, were treated successfully with cryosurgery.	0.8555457162197575
Granuloma faciale is known to be difficult to treat.	0.6259768124339714

The results of early conversion of war fractures by the application of AO osteosynthesis in A group (n = 32) of the injuried, were compared with B group (n = 187) of injuried, treated definitely with external fixator.	0.7118074591832881
There were statistical evaluations and X-ray observations of healing in both groups, as well as the appearances of the most frequent complications such as: Pintract infection, osteitis, pseudoarthrosis and reoperation.	0.6151129499959348
Statistically less significant appearance of complications in A group during 2th and 6th month (p < 0.001) was observed.	0.5969758228299705
In 12th month of observation, these differences statistically disappeared.	0.4701707658730429
Healing observed by X-ray in 2th, 6th and 12th month of observation were no statistically significant differences between the two observed groups.	0.5463074705969311

In 12 patients (40%) concomitant lesions of the intrinsic scapholunate ligaments were diagnosed.	0.5878775656536732
According to Geissler we found grade I-tear in one patient, grade II in three, grade III in six and grade IV in two patients.	0.5896783556172189
The eight individuals with grade III-and IV-lesions additionally revealed marked instablity intraoperatively.	0.41457378609585227
Therefore, operative stabilization was subsequently performed by temporary scapholunate and scaphocapitate arthrodesis.	0.5176347812095345
Seven patients out of this group (87.5%) were followed up clinically and radiologically 3 years postoperatively, on average.	0.8240566238935417
Clinical examination included range of motion tests and a subjective questionnaire concerning pain and working ability.	0.49004863358668826

According to Gartland, 100% of our patients showed an excellent result; these rates were 86% using the Jakim score and 60% using the Cooney scoring system.	0.7367938347293724
According to the subjective questionnaire all of the patients revealed an excellent or good result.	0.822885866831371
Open treatment of shoulder instabilities is well accepted and still golden standard.	0.4847076044317723
But arthroscopic techniques show also good and comparable results.	0.30964020767487976
Arthroscopic procedures however are not accepted for treatment of failures and revision cases.	0.4179410270305949
Therefore we questioned whether a arthroscopic revision procedure is an option after failed first time open or arthroscopic stabilization.	0.45215545271719837
This prospective study was designed to assess the outcome of arthroscopic revision procedures after failed shoulder stabilization.	0.632796285591233
In 1991 the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest with Doppler sonography was accepted by the Medical Council of the Bundesaerztekammer as one of the methods able to shorten the waiting time for fulfilling the criteria for diagnosis of cerebral death.	0.6061693221255222
A survey was undertaken to determine how frequently Doppler sonography has been used since that time in certifying brain death.	0.4790075006586915
A total of 400 questionnaires were sent out to all neurological (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.	0.5624293988112364
In all, 226 questionnaires were returned.	0.2841390803676281
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography has been used to certify brain death, mostly combined with other methods.	0.6498158941477561
The question of whether false positive results have been observed was answered five times in the affirmative.	0.6032818513375382
The background to these cases was clarified by telephone calls.	0.4061096602289073
In order to indicate pitfalls, the examiners reported borderline situations which in part did not fulfil the prerequisites.	0.48296851530100443
In none of these cases had the diagnosis of brain death been based on ultrasound data.	0.7437587828138337
Doppler sonography for the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest has been used by a considerable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments in Germany as an additional confirmatory test and rather seldom as the only method to shorten the waiting period.	0.6539281509155237
We report on a 64-year-old man who died within 1 h after admission to hospital with symptoms of respiratory insufficiency.	0.7289612382299194

Comparison by skin epiluminescent microscopy of 60 malignant melanomas and 130 junctional and compound naevocellular naevi revealed statistically significant differences for 12 characteristics.	0.3810926080941354
The following microscopical in vivo signs that can be defined by histopathological examination were found only in malignant or premalignant melanocytic lesions: digitated radial streaming, greyish-blue reticular patterns, opaque gypseous alabaster lacunas, brown/black dots on a blue/greyish background, pseudopodia at the periphery and blue-in-pink areas.	0.4132845136567404
Nevertheless, specific epiluminescent phenomena of histopathologically defined malignant melanomas are still unknown.	0.4014769506080925
Therefore, diagnostic evaluation of malignancy is based mainly on microscopic assessment of combined details of morphology and colour of melanocytic tumours.	0.526048481384895
The present study examines the relationship between different psychological variables (including anxiety, depression, locus of control, expectations of pain intensity and social support) and postoperative pain, analgesic consumption and satisfaction with the pain management in a study sample of 67 patients.	0.73065344400924
Clinical experience of 11 patients with CHARGE association is reviewed.	0.41504845224089765
The study comprised six girls and five boys.	0.2898673418473956

Both micrognathia and high-arched palate were present in two patients.	0.5564214033105108
Facial palsy was observed in six patients.	0.5597565118789563
Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach with active coordination and cooperation between the appropriate specialities.	0.45759393800059844
The anatomical repair of bilateral choanal atresia should be performed as early as possible.	0.5661977166553547
In our experience, the transpalatal approach is far more satisfactory than the transnasal.	0.560241898093053
It gives the surgeon the opportunity of direct access and anatomical repair.	0.42500319233590544
After the child has grown stronger, a long-term management is desirable including developmental and feeding training.	0.5720727925453805
Thrilling are especially those situations, when people have to make ethical decisions.	0.48210453356202704
Issues of medical ethics crop up not only in hospital series, but often in genres where this subject is hardly to be supposed: comedies, westerns, love stories and gangster movies.	0.49204891775115456
Enacting these conflicts means offering a solution, and in doing so films refer to moral values and - at the same time - function as seismographs for the social relevance of bioethical topics.	0.6818827409803355
But it is possible that ethical principles of good decision-making fall victims to the drama of the story.	0.5500042744404688
Analysis of the portrayed conflict is similar to a case discussion in bioethics and represents a helpful adjunct to the procurement of analytical and communicative competences.	0.4247903625067056
Several experimental studies and randomized clinical trials demonstrate a decrease of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment time of fractionated radiotherapy.	0.5335980496157895
Proliferation or clonogenic tumor cells most likely is the major mechanism underlying this phenomenon.	0.4363628147625841
Important progress in radiation oncology might therefore be expected from inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment.	0.4138851669469351
Possibilities to minimize the time factor are briefly discussed.	0.5526889807415791
Inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by inhibition of signal transduction pathways that stimulate proliferation, or by pharmacological inhibition of angiogenesis are scientifically interesting but currently not proven to be effective to counteract the loss of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment of fractionated irradiation.	0.5558475020815306
At present, the only established approach is to complete radiotherapy within a short overall treatment time, e. g. by accelerated fractionation and by prevention or compensation of unscheduled treatment gaps.	0.5533609776399716
Technical innovations and software improvements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-resolution sonography (US) have definitely influenced the diagnostic imaging of rheumatic diseases.	0.6492021252990298
For MRI, improvements in surface coils, dedicated low-field systems (0.2 T), and software improvements (shorter acquisition times and refinements of fat suppressing techniques) must be mentioned.	0.6012334451930041
For sonography, the main innovations concern the development of higher transducer frequencies (7-15 Mhz) and power Doppler imaging.	0.7106382876174026
Clinical evaluations have shown that MRI and US are most useful in cases of suspected rheumatic disease with negative plain film radiographs and for documenting the course of the disease, diagnosing of early rheumatoid arthritis, making a differential diagnosis in clinically unclear rheumatic diseases, investigating vascularization, and quantifying pannus formation.	0.5842200101983367
In order to improve diagnostic efficacy the role of MRI and US in the management of patients with rheumatic disease should be reconsidered.	0.666191981778184
In addition to renal elimination and gastrointestinal metabolism (amylase; splenic and hepatic dextranase) colloid plasma solutions like dextran and hydroxyethyl starch deposit in tissues, especially in the reticuloendothelial system (RES).	0.4667696766080858
This tissue storage is limited in time (weeks to months), is influenced by the employed solution and other factors (lysosomes) and has usually no clinical importance (no RES blockade).	0.7036048462721938
We report here a case study of a patient with sepsis (lung, liver and kidney failure) who had an overload of the RES with colloids while being treated with dextran (molecular weight 40000 and 70000 daltons) and hydroxyethyl starch (mw 450000 daltons, molar substitution 0,7).	0.6068285325736833
In the late seventies and early eighties the toxic shock syndrome (TSS) became epidemic among young menstruating women.	0.4147934841772631
A strong correlation was found between TSS and the rising popularity of hyperabsorbent tampons.	0.4942923796089802
Exotoxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus is seen as the main mediator of TSS in controlled clinical trials.	0.5321744036622459
Menstrual and nonmenstrual forms of TSS are differentiated.	0.27324388031234625
The nonmenstrual form is comparatively rare and has a high rate of mortality rate.	0.585168878755364
Several studies showed that the overall incidence of menstrual and nonmenstrual TSS is approximately 1-3 cases per 100 000 persons.	0.6107521330110208
The leading symptoms are fever, hypotension, mucous membrane hyperemia, diffuse rashes, myalgias, vomiting and diarrhea.	0.43741816847876136
The severe form of the syndrome leads to multiorgan dysfunction.	0.5058299799208762
The streptococcal TSS (STSS) caused by group A Streptococci is clinically similar to the staphylococcal TSS.	0.408543111956591
Both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococci produce the exotoxin TSST-1.	0.21505298883932897
New methods allow the detection of TSST-1 production.	0.3355833020085743
However, due to the low incidence of TSS, this method of detection has not yet been taken up in the routine diagnostic procedures.	0.7663810477882074
This report focusses on the emergence and spread of S. aureus with special clinical and epidemiological significance.	0.5541733338261676
Results from typing MRSA originating from different clinical sources in all Germany reveal that there is a continuing interhospital dissemination of definite epidemic strains and also a spread of the mecA gene to clonal groups of S. aureus which have been until now sensitive.	0.5021957996497693
These newly emerging MRSA are still sensitive to a number of other antibiotics.	0.41176044979733195
This results in less broad resistance phenotypes of currently disseminated MRSA.	0.29829340598569204
Worth mentioning with regard to diagnostics are also three clinical cases of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by S. aureus possessing secC and not tst.	0.4869545655381721
Background: For cataract surgery in this country retro- and peribulbar anesthesia is the standard method.	0.7421823488666996
It totally stops eye movement as well as sensitivity to pain.	0.3133050694203536
Especially peribulbar anesthesia is known as a procedure with minimal complications, but the potential risks can be severe.	0.7411342798354129
In the past sponge anesthesia could not be used on patients with difficult cataract surgery due to the insufficient anesthetic effect.	0.6887644733767817
A modified anesthetic method is demonstrated for complicated cataract surgery.	0.3491417072118009
In patients with coronary artery disease, it is controversial whether cardiac arrhythmias result from acute subendocardial ischemia.	0.571766614618415
The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmia.	0.6066647303783117
The immunopathogenesis of cardiac rhythm and conduction disorders has been underestimated.	0.35364395922295416
Therefore, the aim of this review is to analyze the current data and controversial issues in this area.	0.7377959480414125
We report the case of an 8 year old boy with a rare congenital myopathy (with cytoplasmic inclusions bodies) and clinical signs of rigid-spine-syndrome.	0.7098759420955195
During treatment of lung tuberculosis disordered breathing with hypoventilation during REM-sleep, hypoxemia and persistent hypercapnia during daytime were found.	0.37796758329883734
This complication in myopathies is caused by weakness of respiratory muscles and leads to negative features (like pulmonary hypertension, daytime-sleepiness, growth failure or further impairement of the muscle disease).	0.47451699333803965
Diagnostic steps in disorders of breathing during sleep in children with neuromuscular disease are shown.	0.5394797955421887
Aortic dissection with no entry or false lumen flow was recently identified as intramural hemorrhage of the aortic wall (IMH).	0.4843294078781988
Analysis of the literature revealed 209 cases of in vivo diagnosed IMH reflecting 17% of all dissections, whereas in autoptic studies this condition is found in 4-13%.	0.8115480450014885
Transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and aortography (to rule out dissection) have been applied for diagnosing IMH in 57, 49, 43 and 38% of the cases, respectively.	0.6391375562319057
However, diagnostic accuracy of each modality is not available to date.	0.6805954369325297
In 34%, IMH involves the ascending aorta (type A).	0.5569275020566086
The average age of patients with IMH ranges between 55 and 65 years; 65% are males.	0.7009365821147979
In 12%, IMH was associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm.	0.5438070949280581
With 87%, arterial hypertension is the predominant risk factor for IMH irrespective of its location.	0.5648971212543095
As suggested by the term "mediastinal apoplexy" IMH may - similar to cerebral apoplexy - result from hypertensive rupture of the vasa vasorum in the aortic media.	0.5442029185908779
With 97%, the majority of patients present with acute chest or back pain similar to classic dissection.	0.6042215164669317
Mediastinal widening is found in 83%; signs of hemothorax/pleural effusion are present in 38%, acute aortic regurgitation in 26%, pericardial effusion in 23%, acute neurologic deficits in 12%, and pulse deficits in 5%.	0.5833827694637255
In 18%, IMH progresses to dissection and in another 15% to rupture.	0.7338763601351934
In 25% and 28%, respectively, dissection and rupture occur in the ascending aorta and in 12% and 9%, respectively, in the descending thoracic aorta.	0.8043598463265997
The 30-day mortality of IMH is 24% (36% with type A and 12% with type B IMH; p<0.05).	0.6825265621576346
With surgical repair, mortality of type A IMH is lowered to 18% compared to 60% with medical treatment (p<0.01).	0.6437254825856388
In contrast, with 8% mortality associated with medical treatment, prognosis of type B IMH is more favorable without surgical intervention, the latter associated with a 30-day mortality of 33% (p<0.05).	0.693942948347817
Thus, IMH is a potential precursor of dissection and should be managed like dissection with undelayed surgical intervention in patients with type A IMH and with medical treatment in type B IMH.	0.7160026046167897
We report on 3 exemplary case studies of patients with myelomeningocele who are under regular care in our outpatient clinic, and discuss the clinical and diagnostic problems and the therapeutic concept of fractures in patients with myelomeningocele.	0.825836072765183
Our case reports are in accordance to previous publications; they show that signs of confined and systemic infection and variable X-ray signs with often extensive reactive formation of callus make the diagnosis of fractures in myelomeningocele patients difficult.	0.5252490620943022
Fractures often occur without pain or trauma.	0.2454757339406105
Background: Since the end of the 1960ies, accidents have been identified as the most common cause of mortality in children and account for considerable childhood morbidity in industrialized western countries.	0.7372165026028347
In contrast to traffic-related accidents in older children and adolescents, which were consequently registered and documented, no epidemiological data exist about home injuries and accidents during the first years of life in Germany.	0.7640298449641943
This report presents data on accident-related hospitalizations in a cohort of 10271 infants, who participated in a prospective vaccine efficacy trial in Germany from 1991 to 1994.	0.6096594661245612
One-hundred-thirty patients underwent 53 electrophysiological studies including programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation and 96 atrial overdrive stimulations on an outpatient basis.	0.4182995005383002

On the basis of the result of electrophysiological testing, 25 patients were believed not to require any treatment, 16 patients received new drug therapy, 7 patients underwent catheter ablation in a second session, 2 patients had either a pacemaker or an ICD implanted, and 1 patient continued to receive the drug therapy that had been tested.	0.7999529882519008
Atrial overdrive stimulation resulted in a regular sinus rhythm in 66 patients (69%).	0.4806359770148171
Except for one patient in whom atrial flutter could not be terminated, atrial fibrillation was induced in the remaining 30 patients.	0.7679835159030716
After the procedure, patients were monitored for 30 min in case of overdrive stimulation, and for approximately 3 h after electrophysiological study or 6 h if additional coronary angiography had been performed.	0.752320044147671
Severe complications were not observed.	0.2764551013077421
In 10 cases minor hematoma occurred at the puncture site without serious sequelae.	0.40156728834208727

Endosteal implants after tumor surgery of the face are helpful in reconstructing facial defects.	0.5627403254454352
A retrospective study of our patients treated using craniofacial implants was conducted to evaluate long-term results.	0.7588052563564655
A total of 128 implants were inserted, 110 implants in the periorbital, 12 implants in the mastoid, and six implants in the paranasal region; 113 implants were short craniofacial Brånemark implants, and 15 implants were dental implants.	0.6470021490152117
The success rate for implant survival was 94.5%.	0.5740823521274407
Long-term results were promising and more than satisfactory, leading to a large indication for these endosteal implants.	0.6775000788162422
The term "Ecstasy" includes a group of different methylenedioxyamphetamines which produce hallucinogenic activity, stimulation and the so-called 'entactogenic' effects.	0.45415360327532156
- "Entactogen" is usually translated as "producing a touching within" or "creating an internal contact" and refers to the special psychotropic effect of this substances.	0.7161949604960164
Entactogens have been reported to make users aware of previously unconscious feelings and experiences.	0.490822006141739
The "entactogenic" effect is the most typical of the psychedelic effects n 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA).	0.5748372028699689
MDMA induces euphoria and acts stimulating, but the most common effect of MDMA is a heightened sense of "closeness" with other people.	0.6911228527495852
The negative effects, especially depression and a general sense of anxiety, may endure after the acute phase of ecstasy.	0.7561939726378403
Ecstasy is not a novel substance.	0.6110463325020142
However, the rapid spread connected with the arising techno-scene and the increasing prevalence of ecstasy-use world-wide is unprecedented.	0.5862771683474337
Cisatracurium - one of the ten stereoisomers of atracurium - is an intermediate long-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.	0.7083696294855677
Cardiovascular reactions have been described after administration of cisatracurium or vecuronium in surgical patients.	0.6213119625218029
After approval by our institutional review board, 62 patients (ASA I-II) were randomly assigned to three groups to either receive 3xED95 or 5xED95 of cisatracurium or 3xED90 of vecuronium prior to intubation as a bolus.	0.49595237245956336
After oral premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam anaesthesia was induced with thiopental (4-12 mg/kg) and maintained with O2/N2O and isoflurane (1.5%-2%).	0.7085712378993989
Six minutes after administration of thiopental, patients received the muscle relaxant.	0.7235694929965132
Six minutes later 0.1-0.2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated.	0.6298310247675587
Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored every minute.	0.6610109061748038
Changes of heart rate or blood pressure >20% compared to baseline were defined as clinically significant.	0.6520130414441986
After application of the study drug, median values of blood pressure and heart rate were stable.	0.7826833754377907
For each muscle relaxant, there were several patients who had statistically significant cardiovascular changes.	0.756352118874868
After 3xED95 cisatracurium, 3 of 21 patients exhibited haemodynamic changes >20% (2 exhibited hypotension and 1 tachycardia), while in the high-dose cisatracurium group 2 of 21 patients demonstrated a tachycardia that was predetermined to be statistically but not clinically significant.	0.7470681900310177
In the vecuronium group, 2 of 20 patients sustained statistically significant hypotension and 1 patient had statistically significant tachycardia.	0.7283717554257038
The frequency of all individual cardiovascular changes after the application of the muscle relaxant was not dose-dependent.	0.6243283449220242
After the administration of cisatracurium in two different doses (3xED95 and 5xED95) or vecuronium (3xED90) only minor cardiovascular changes were observed.	0.6014032615169668
Both drugs proved to be safe for use during induction of anaesthesia in patients ASA I-II.	0.531547867431218
With regard to its cardiovascular effects, cisatracurium shares with vecuronium the requirements of an ideal muscle relaxant.	0.48579142884365883
Between June 1993 and September 1995, 18 distal femoral fractures were treated using the supracondylar intramedullary nail.	0.5366333599642121
There were 8 type A fractures and 10 type C fractures (AO classification).	0.4871956515975355
The operative technique involved retrograde insertion of an unreamed supracondylar nail through the intercondylar notch.	0.4972806562716643
Follow-up was available on all patients and averaged 18.3 months (range 6-32 months).	0.8346651122616393
All fractures healed with an average time to union of 12.4 weeks (range 8-16 weeks).	0.8626657018344329
Bone grafting was not necessary in any case.	0.6260142017104475
Sixteen patients achieved almost the same ROM as they had had before the injury.	0.4149870179230048
One patient developed a varus malignment and underwent correction with a supracondylar osteotomy 20 months post trauma.	0.44769250726315946
There were no infections or nonunions.	0.5250803389003538
The retrograde supracondylar nail is an excellent alternative to plate osteosynthesis in the management of dia- and supracondylar femoral fractures.	0.6103962255627252
Autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogenic (AAA) bone is an osteoinductive preparation of completely demineralized bone matrix.	0.3746184024030042
It has been clinically applied for years.	0.4562330004734801
In an experimental study in rabbits, we evaluated the influence of cortical bone and periosteum on the amount of bone formation following augmentation with AAA bone.	0.7022412252358464
Two implants of standardized size were placed on the femoral bone of rabbits.	0.52553725870146
A cell-excluding PTFE membrane was wrapped circularly around the femur as well as the anterior implant shielding the implant from the surrounding periosteum.	0.5102580891303713
The posterior implant was exposed directly to the periosteum while being shielded from the cortical bone by the membrane.	0.4343362350857559
Thus, two compartments were created selectively, preventing contact between the periosteum or cortical bone and the implants.	0.5999783820072335
For each compartment the area and volume of the induced new bone were evaluated by computerized radiograph analysis and quantitative CT (pQCT) scans.	0.489596609014975
Implantation of AAA bone led to new bone formation in both compartments.	0.5237906207270135
Contact of the periosteum and the implant led to an almost fourfold increase in bone volume.	0.581298466771328
Although bone formation showed interindividual variations, the difference of both compartments was highly significant using the Student's t-test for paired samples (P < 0.0001).	0.5347101366138339
The data show that periosteum is the primary source of new bone formation in augmentations with osteoinductive materials as it is rich in inducible progenitor cells and is well vascularized.	0.5753451677818868
In osseous augmentations with AAA bone, the periosteum should be preserved in order to achieve a close contact of the osteoinductive implant.	0.6143286178935807
Shielding from the periosteum, e.g., by cell-excluding membranes, leads to significantly less bone formation following implantation of AAA bone and should therefore be avoided.	0.6034228893578703
Computed tomography is a significant source of medical radiation exposure for populations in Europe.	0.473709892454077
Reduced radiation exposure may be possible with modern CT scanners with an image quality that while less good than before remains acceptable for clinical purposes.	0.4132281156576096
The lung appears particularly well suited to investigation with low-dose CT owing to the high contrast between normal and diseased pulmonary parenchyma.	0.6576940854617835
Undernutrition, particularly protein undernutrition, contributes to the occurrence of osteoporotic fracture, by lowering bone mass and altering muscle strength.	0.5921937313917165
Furthermore, the rate of medical complications after fracture can also be increased by nutritional deficiency.	0.6418024959667034
The IGF-I system appears to be directly involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to osteoporotic hip fracture in elderly and to its complications.	0.5253072820525131
In the presence of adequate calcium and vitamin D supplies, protein supplements increasing the intakes from low to normal, raises IGF-I levels, improves the clinical outcome after hip fracture, and attenuates the decrease in proximal femur bone mineral density in the year following the fracture.	0.5409577549647995
This nutritional approach is associated with a significant reduction of the stay in rehabilitation hospital.	0.6472483317418102
This underlines the importance of nutritional supports in preventing and healing osteoporotic fractures.	0.32321356914776445
The article discusses changes in the context within which the social professions are exercised.	0.6534252256860698
The chances for a refinancing of social work and indeed its very locations change in line with the transition to new steering elements in the social body and the new implementation of competitive elements in the realm of public law.	0.4955689848074399
With the economising of the social sphere social work is questioned under economic aspects.	0.4080348229582769
Simultaneously it gains normative significance.	0.16832211839863487
This is true with regard to standards for the quality of services and institutions, and further in the context of the discussion concerning the revitalisation of local social policy for the elderly.	0.5972279920737041
Precisely the economising of the social sphere raises the question whether the municipalities may be excused from their responsibility to form, preserve and support the obligations of social work with the elderly.	0.5075318519150798
A comparison was made of the staining intensities of selected immunohistochemical proliferating antigens (p53, PCNA, Ki67), DNA flow-cytometry and ultrastructures of neoplastic cells from 120 cases of laryngeal cancers.	0.4537301995830975
Clinically very advanced tumors were in the majority (T3, 43%; T4, 18%).	0.6344356393786776
A 5-grade scale was adopted to evaluate the level of immunohistochemical staining of the carcinoma cell nuclei.	0.5564537543736534
Positive staining was obtained in 70% for p53, 57% for Ki67 and 80% for PCNA.	0.8253398011665175
Sixty-two percent of the cases were DNA-diploid and 38% DNA-aneuploid.	0.6627046868878187
The DNA-diploid carcinomas were accompanied by enlargement of the cell nuclei, preservation of wide margins of nuclear heterochromatin, enlargements of the nuclear areas and increases in the number of nuclei.	0.5461162078939847
In the aneuploid-polyploid cancers the nuclei had a substantial polymorphism, with large cleaved nuclei showing significant variations in size and having a nuclear envelope.	0.4379303543226783
A frequent finding was euchromatization of chromatin.	0.22640674483090267
Dense chromatin appeared in the form of small clumps spread over the whole area of these irregular nuclei.	0.4059348615407828
Enlargement and activation of nucleoli were found.	0.2440554985265433
The antipyretic analgesics still comprise the most widely used group of analgesic compounds.	0.33340972880426417
Until twenty years ago, aspirin, phenazone derivatives and acetaminophen had been used as standard remedies for intercurrent harmless pain conditions in connection with infections, trauma, small surgeries, but also for tension headache and other painful conditions.	0.5858081227451989
During the last decades, this group has been supplemented by a variety of 2-arylpropionic acids being primarily developed for the treatment of rheumatic pain and inflammation.	0.7074798886269904
Some of them (e.g.	0.22927830631278714
ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) have been given over-the-counter status in some countries because of their relative safety at low doses.	0.5399530597906179
Nevertheless, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences among the various substances of this group make them suitable to a different degree for the treatment of pain conditions.	0.49290115626451125
A 38-year-old man presented with an intracranial extra-axial tumour at the base of the left posterior fossa which proved to be a meningeal melanocytoma.	0.6603665534222699
Meningeal melanocytoma is a rare, benign melanotic tumour of the leptomeninges occuring predominantly in the posterior fossa or the upper spinal cord in adults.	0.6398648082644551
It shows characteristic cytologic features with isomorphic epitheloid or spindle-shaped cells, often with prominent nucleoli and a variable content of intracytoplasmic melanin.	0.5017212443588869
It usually lacks signs of malignancy such as high mitotic rate, necroses or infiltrative growth and shows a low labeling index in proliferation marker studies.	0.38987779151743424
Its immunohistological profile with S-100 protein-, vimentin- and HMB-45-positive tumour cells is similar to that of (primary or metastatic) malignant melanoma.	0.7368393130257748
This differential diagnosis is crucial because of the totally different therapeutic and prognostic implications.	0.5987929702175594
Therefore, everyone dealing with surgical neuropathology should be familiar with the rare, but clinically important diagnosis of meningeal melanocytoma.	0.5387464328032552
A 54-year old, obese woman suffered from massive symmetrical swelling of the face, especially of the upper and lower eyelids.	0.7359057575831275
Initially the swelling occured intermittently, but after 2 years it was permanent and progressive markedly limiting her visual fields.	0.5319297435916283
Neither laboratory findings nor imaging procedures provided any firm evidence of an underlying cardiac, renal or endocrinological disease.	0.4753861797460835
There was no suggestion of a storage disease.	0.44393106919582626
Skin biopsy showed foam cells and granulomatous inflammation, so the patient was tentatively diagnosed as having a monosymptomatic Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome.	0.6116080344909979
Eyelid surgery was performed to improve her visual fields.	0.5863662211877412
Treatment with clofazimine 100 mg daily was initiated.	0.2824400052166955
Regular follow-up visits over 7 months revealed no evidence of recurrence.	0.4581215177836249
The patient died a sudden cardiac death a few months later.	0.7358893465914716
The relatives refused an autopsy.	0.1321282613231551
The definite cause of her facial swelling remains unclear as we discuss the differential diagnostic possibilities.	0.5161230064630689
An 81-year-old patient had prolonged competitive neuromuscular blockade with train-of-four ratios of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively, after two successive anaesthesia procedures (enflurane-N2O/O2; vecuronium-succinylcholine-sequence) for transurethral prostate resection.	0.6807582424490611
Although antagonism with neostigmine was promptly successful after the first, 65-min period of anaesthesia (1.5 mg vecuronium for precurarization, 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation, 3 mg vecuronium), repetitive and chronologically staggered administration of neostigmine after the second, 30-min period of anaesthesia (1 mg vecuronium for precurarization, 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation) had hardly any effect, so that the patient had to be ventilated mechanically for a total of 4.5 h. Laboratory analysis revealed homozygous, atypical, plasma cholinesterase (790 U/l; dibucaine number 23; genotype E<![CDATA[|lefbop|a<![CDATA[|clobop||opnbop|1<![CDATA[|clobop|E<![CDATA[|lefbop|a<![CDATA[|clobop||opnbop|1<![CDATA[|clobop|).	0.5456122010072687
This retrospectively confirmed a succinylcholine-induced phase II block in both instances, as had already been suspected following the second anaesthetic procedure.	0.5260035775861696
The degree of block transformation, and thus the available time, are decisive in explaining the diverse effects of antagonism here.	0.6979622132824563
It must be assumed that a complete phase II block developed after the first succinylcholine exposure owing to the longer duration of anaesthesia; the purely competitive component (train-of-four ratio 0.1) was easily antagonized by neostigmine.	0.6819051696424746
At the time of the attempted antagonism after the second, shorter period of anaesthesia, however, block transformation was still incomplete (train-of-four ratio 0.5).	0.5692624311905459
The administration of neostigmine therefore rather intensified the depolarization segment of the mixed block, so that repeated attempts at antagonism then inhibited any further block transformation.	0.44572842657192113
The Ph1-negative groups of chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPD) are described, and histopathological criteria that distinguish them from each other are given.	0.5714896106591396
These are based upon observations in primary biopsies from 2,331 patients with CMPDs among a total of 34,160 patients referred between 1 January 1989 and 30 June 1994 to the Bone Marrow Registry.	0.5809410283541752
These cases of CMPD break down into the main groups as follows: CML 23.2 %, megakaryocytic myelosis consistent with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia 22.3 %, essential thrombocythemia 22.1 %, and polycythemia vera 20.4 %; 12.0 % of cases were unclassifiable.	0.615136764648021
Histological progress in each group is characterized by (1) increasing number and pleomorphy of megakaryocytes, (2) increasing fibrosis, and (3) excess of blasts.	0.6682025233079508
These three features can be observed in diagnostic biopsies before any therapy.	0.5508622558050992
Therefore, it is recommended that such alterations be reported semiquantitatively.	0.6285229754816203
A staging system with four stages from 0 to 3 for each of the three features is introduced.	0.6072923323244651
Its application allows staging for the individual patient on the basis of diagnostic biop-sies.	0.46887038030279315
Chondral and osteochondral lesions as well as bone bruises of the ankle are caused in the most cases by trauma and are localized almost exclusively at the talus.	0.6211475509987969
For diagnosis, operative management and follow up, magnetic resonance imaging was useful, which can be further improved by application of intravenous or intraarticullar contrast enhancement (Gadolinium).	0.6210397659288228
In adults operative therapy is favored.	0.3155844344138788
Due to new techniques, arthroscopy became an important alternative to arthrotomy.	0.5497538372741413
According to the stage of the disease, drilling or curettage, removal or fixation of the fragment, autologous bone transplantation or osteochondral graft can be performed.	0.6226826482485771
All procedures can be managed arthroscopically.	0.47703358871188567
General Psychotherapy isn't a new type of therapy, but it could be a paradigmatic model for all empirically-oriented psychotherapists.	0.6089813119006002
The contents of this model are defined.	0.48280330727931614
Arguments and reasons are put forward as to why the practice of psychotherapy should be guided by empirically based procedure rules instead of by therapy methods.	0.3780710223312312
The procedure rules should be joined together by a theoretical conception of psychological functioning, from which their relative significance and prescription conditions can be derived.	0.4719596376853813
A consistency-theory based model of psychological functioning is sketched, from which conclusions can be drawn about the emergence and maintenance of psychological disorders on the one hand and the prescription conditions of different therapeutic procedures on the other.	0.6227796900750906
The advantages of this model in view of a general psychotherapy are discussed.	0.722602230433636
In the Federal Republic of Germany, no data existed regarding the frequency of open heart surgery for excision of cardiac neoplasms.	0.5646862092993813
Therefore, a standard questionnaire concerning heart tumors was sent to all 77 German heart centers performing cardiac surgery.	0.5347908973612283
Although induction chemotherapy administered prior to local therapy produces encouraging initial response rates in head and neck cancer, randomized studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in survival rates.	0.5928377048405015
All randomized studies included only patients with advanced stage III and IV disease.	0.6223128997638966
In our opinion, this is the main reason for the low rate of complete responses demonstrated in the randomized trials (maximum 18%).	0.7210646650693637
estimate that a 40%-50% complete response rate is necessary before improved survival rates are seen.	0.6333127336444236
To date, such complete response rates with induction chemotherapy have only been attainable in resectable T2-T3, N0-N2 disease.	0.5471467050861647
Therefore, we initiated a prospective randomized trial including only patients with the mentioned disease stages.	0.7238125858117047
Patients (pts) were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy with three cycles of carboplatin/5-FU prior to surgery and radiotherapy (arm A, 70 pts) or standard treatment with surgery and radiotherapy (arm B, 74 pts).	0.7512684811473707
Patients were classified according to primary tumour site and neck disease.	0.49437474383005414
The observed remission rate after chemotherapy confirmed the primary estimated rate for this subgroup of patients with head and neck cancer (CR: 43%, PR: 37%, NR: 15%, PD: 5%).	0.5589544727593305
After a follow-up of 12-96 months overall survival was 58% in arm A and 45% in arm B (n.s.).	0.8473699912228979
Disease-free survival in arm A (61%) is statistically significantly better than in arm B (43%, P=0.03).	0.733875623929794
Therefore, we recommend further controlled trials to investigate the role of induction chemotherapy in patients with primary resectable carcinomas of the oral cavity and tonsils and stage T2-T3 and N0-N2 disease prior to surgery.	0.6719598603511071
Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery has evolved as a reliable method to perform left internal mammary artery (LIMA) bypass surgery to the LAD.	0.6088291200847027
This novel technique represents a synthesis of known approaches to coronary surgery using sternotomy without extracorporeal circulation and limited access techniques in general thoracic surgery.	0.42538922607679475
Applying specially designed tools for both harvesting the internal mammary artery and mechanically stabilizing the anterior surface of the heart during anastomosis, this approach is gaining widespread acceptance.	0.6109239360157412
A steadily growing number of patients with proximal LAD lesions are submitted to cardiac surgery and the procedure is performed with increasing success rates, now approaching 98% short term patency.	0.658470957368203
In a specific series war injuries in the trochanteric region were characterized; a limited methodological approach magnified the problem.	0.5080928243398968
Our experience and the treatment results (debridement, drainage and external fixation) are presented.	0.7637318699549939
The methodology, complications and final results are also given for 15 patients.	0.5077294927203574
Consolidation was achieved in primary external fixation without additional procedures such as spongioplasty or internal fixation conversion methods.	0.46202848267690355
The time to consolidation without complications was 28.6 weeks (24-36) and with complications (deep infections, chronic osteomyelitis) 40.8 weeks (28-68).	0.7976265051130145
In total, there was one poor result with angulation, shortening of the extremity and chronic intermittent fistulation.	0.7164981907662769
The average follow-up was 22.7 months (1-34 months).	0.865548841547285
Our personal experience and the results speak on behalf of external fixation.	0.5858912845229992
Under war conditions, primary fixation ensures the best late anatomical and functional results.	0.4650274108462232
Minimal osteosynthesis improves the final outcome if the rules of application and the indications for selection are adhered to strictly.	0.46441467074505993
Introduction of the computed tomography index CTDI and the multiple scan average dose (MSAD) has led to standardization of the dose description in CT examinations.	0.5581790596736649
Despite the use of these dose parameters, many different dosages are reported in the literature for different CT methods.	0.7437791653774037
In addition, there is still a wide range of radiation dosimetry results reported for conventional CT, helical CT, and HRCT used in chest examinations.	0.6571174570308611
The variations in dosage are mainly due to differences in factors affecting the dose, i. e. beam geometry, beam quality, scanner geometry ("generation"), and operating parameters.	0.549844816239896
In addition, CT dosimetry instrumentation and methodology make a contribution to dosages.	0.4655328835368035
Recent studies calculating differences in factors affecting dosage and CT dosimetry and using similar operating parameters, show similar results in CT dosimetry for conventional and helical CT. On the other hand, dosages for HRCT were greatly reduced.	0.47662538791284825
This was mainly caused by narrow beam collimation and increasing section spacing.	0.32209366990589944
Central pulmonary embolism represents one of the most threatening complications in surgical patients.	0.6094104135975059
In most cases deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities is the source of emboli.	0.6654424380975399
Despite the introduction of hypocoagulative drugs in standard surgical concepts the incidence of deep vein thrombosis remains about 10 % in trauma patients.	0.6216257905765844
Estimated numbers of unknown cases of pulmonary embolism are supposed to be rather high too.	0.6128710944682793
In haemodynamically symptomatic pulmonary embolism events and especially when the patient has to be reanimated, mortality rates of up to 93 % are reported in literature.	0.7731560904421242

Imaging of tumors of the pancreas may have a series of significant implications for surgical decision making.	0.6447592553532554
First of all verification and localization of a suspected tumor is crucial.	0.4790701129693522
Later on, accurate staging of local tumor extent and of distant metastases is necessary for evaluating the indications for surgical intervention.	0.6473514023456841
If histologic proof of malignancy of a pancreatic lesion is needed, different imaging techniques can be used for percutaneous biopsy of the tumor.	0.6545000962805786
Finally imaging is required in patients with a pancreatic tumor if an obstruction of the common bile duct is treated with palliative intent by endoscopy or transhepatic intervention.	0.6000244775603284
A rational and efficient selection from all the imaging techniques currently available requires a clear-cut definition of what is needed for surgical decision making in each individual case.	0.48844336873563937
Thereby one has to take into account whether the tumor arises from the exocrine or from the endocrine tissue of the pancreas.	0.5817449357413905
In spite of the importance of skin diseases in Africa south of the Sahara, dermatology is insufficiently represented within the established primary health care systems.	0.44730910826950093
Aim of this study was to find out whether an integrated dermatology project could reduce the prevalence of dermatoses.	0.5260459145833953
Magnetic resonance imaging has shown to be a sensitive method for diagnostics of the red bone marrow, the composition of which changes physiologically and during pathological processes.	0.7186664518347542
However, the interpretation of MRI in patients with disorders of the red bone marrow is very difficult.	0.7858453951177223
The aim of this study was the characterization of the proton spectrum of healthy bone marrow and its age- and sex-dependent changes to obtain a data basis for measurements in patients.	0.6786973080139612
We report a case of a 26-year-old patient, a tilelayer by profession, with a history of a fall from a height of 5 meters with blunt thoracic injury and resultant left atrial rupture.	0.6651878968195849
The emergency doctor found at the site of accident a deeply comatose patient (Glasgow Coma Scale 3 points) with no recordable blood pressure.	0.5777583665963341
After two hours of resuscitation at the site of accident and at the closest emergency traumatology unit a marginal blood pressure was seen.	0.5489827531838366
With a suspicion of a closed ascending aortic rupture the patient was transferred to the nearest cardiothoracic surgical unit.	0.5474910358086855
During transfer, the patient had a cardiac standstill with asystole and was further reanimated and resuscitated.	0.6738618588998583
On arrival the patient was transferred to the operation theatre immediately and after femoro-femoral cannulation was supported by a heart-lung-machine circulation.	0.6051374016552441
Through an optimal exposition the internal thoracic organs were inspected in detail and the rupture of the left atrium was identified and treated.	0.6134524949895203
The heart was effectively emptied and with deep hypothermia with a reduction of oxygen consumption by all organs especially the brain was taken care of.	0.46612547568393503

Since mitochondrial diseases lead frequently to severe phenotypes and are often hereditary, there is a need for genetic counselling of the affected families.	0.5911064619317872
The specific features of mitochondrial genetics, however, hamper straightforward definition of recurrence risks as in Mendelian diseases.	0.3925056250096226
Empirical risks were recently provided for MELAS and MERRF syndromes and for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.	0.2957998210951371
In MELAS and MERFF, higher levels of mutant mtDNA in the mothers' blood were associated with an increased frequency of affected offspring.	0.5065777991872226
Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and Kearns-Sayre syndrome are in general sporadic disorders without increased recurrence risks in the offspring.	0.3801143407346771
As Leigh syndrome is found with maternal, autosomal recessive or X chromosomal transmission, the definition of the molecular defect is crucial for genetic counselling.	0.562050266493944
Prenatal diagnosis was reported only in one case of mitochondrial disease so far, and in our opinion it remains questionable because of the uncertain correlation of the proportion of mutant DNA in chorionic villi and in  clinically relevant tissues such as brain.	0.6959633876169683
An accurate and complete depiction of the halo naevus has been left by Matthias Grünewald in his painting "The Temptation of St. Anthony", which is part of the Isenheim altar piece (1512 - 1516), which is now exhibited in Colmar, Alsace.	0.5822985587848468
In contrast, Sutton in 1916 only described a "leucoderma acquisitum centrifugum", leaving the nature of the central lesion in the dark.	0.5610377284712236
The term Sutton naevus therefore appears less appropriate than the alternative eponymic designation "Grünewald naevus".	0.3192519055886519
In women with breast cancer, staging of the tumor plays an important role and often is considered to be the most prognostic and therapeutic factor.	0.7899866546876957
The most widely used staging system is based on the pathologic TNM classification.	0.5019514808291877
In recent years conservative therapies such as preoperative chemo- or radiotherapy are used more often with limited tissue evaluation resulting in insufficient or even inaccurate staging data.	0.5530306881099695
Tumor size as well as nodal involvement is decisive in selecting a treatment method and assessing the response.	0.4224760242346046
Thus, more accurate preoperative in vivo staging is necessary.	0.5318452210679881
This article therefore gives an overview of the different imaging modalities (mammography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine) used for breast cancer staging.	0.6084972903275088
Furthermore, results of these methods are compared critically with the pathohistologic staging.	0.6407717194549211
The lack of muscle control in neurological disorders often leads to deformities of the foot.	0.40086897273955086
The equinus (a contracture of the triceps surae muscle), the abduction and clubfoot deformity are the most common ones.	0.637924925626343
The present paper describes the deformities and stresses the functional relevance for the patient.	0.5038112766775414
Therapeutic principles of the conservative orthopaedic means are described with special emphasis on the need of an adequate height of the aide and the foot position.	0.6404328997311245
Casting and the application of Botulinun toxine are described having a major side effect of muscle weakening.	0.4086661222576006
A combination of the different procedures, surgical interventions included, need to be selected for each patient offering the best management for each individual problem.	0.7584676174490296
Still's disease was originally described as one form of rheumatoid arthritis in children beginning with fever and other systemic symptoms.	0.5662584220584426
In rare cases it may also begin in the adult and is then referred to as adult-onset Still's disease.	0.5590481516629777
The diagnostic criteria include typical rash, arthralgias, bouts of fever, and leukocytosis, as well as lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, liver dysfunctions, non-infectious angina, and absence of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies.	0.5977520392789009
We report two adult patients with longstanding disease whose exanthema guided us to the correct diagnosis.	0.555401246659566
The rash is a finding with high sensitivity.	0.4189789229970348
It is characterized by red macules with distinct borders and is evanescent.	0.3953517470033879
During an acute flare of the rash, gentle friction induces erythematous, isomorphic (Koebner) phenomena, which, as we describe here for the first time, may persist longer than the remainder of the fleeting rash.	0.5647680957482849
Objective: Patients in a surgical intensive care unit (ICU) have a high incidence of nosocomial infections which often lead to septic shock and death.	0.7672731557989108
Since calculated antibiotic treatment is often difficult, it was recommended to obtain routine nose/throat swabs in order to have a better idea of the causative agent when a systemic inflammatory response occurs in a given patient.	0.7302561644324124
Methods: In 1435 patients of our cardio-surgical ICU, routine nose/throat swabs were taken three times a week and tested for micro-organisms and resistance to antibiotics.	0.5145267029671936
Of these 86 patients developed clinical signs of systemic inflammation, and additional blood cultures were obtained.	0.5989743427240571
Antibiotic treatment was achieved to cover the microbes from the nose/throat swabs, or a calculated dosage was given to patients whose swabs had tested negative.	0.582126705809509
Results: Of the 86 patients with systemic inflammation, 29 had blood cultures positive for microbes.	0.6805158248365103
Of these 29 patients, 18 received a calculated antibiotic coverage based on their positive nose/throat cultures prior to the return of the blood cultures from the lab.	0.6492136666814448
However, in only 11 of the 18 patients were routine swabs and blood cultures positive with the same microbes.	0.7442796482620412
While positive routine swabs are quite specific for sepsis when there is a systemic inflammatory response, routine swabs are not a suitable screening tool due to their low sensitivity.	0.6188715569876355
Conclusions: Routine nose/throat swabs led to earlier specific antibiotic treatment in only 22% of our patients with clinical signs of systemic inflammation.	0.6436490236785918
In addition, in almost 40% of the cases organisms detected in the routine swabs and blood cultures were not identical.	0.8436546507336229
As a result, we feel that routine swabs are only of limited value in instituting earlier, specific antibiotic treatment in septic patients.	0.6358411320363269
The influence of defensivity, measured by validity scales of personality inventories (MMPI-K, FPI-R, GIESSEN-Test) on test results and psychotherapy outcome was studied in 309 patients treated with inpatient client-centered therapy.	0.5106456977861807
In general, psychotherapy patients exhibited low defensivity.	0.38284602718100824
25% of patients, who denied psychopathology at admission, did so at discharge and to some extent at follow-up, demonstrating an "especially good outcome" (means).	0.6223587677657665
Relative improvement (effect sizes), however, was significantly diminished in psychopathology scales and significantly enlarged in validity scales.	0.4893799722608344

In our study we tested 2 different rapid assays for cardiac troponin t (TropT-rapid assay, diagnostic cut-off 0,2 ng/ml and TropTsensitive-rapid assay, diagnostic cut-off 0,1 ng/ml) in 75 chest pain patients.	0.5829787555902397
Additional to the emergency ECG (3-lead) we acquired a 12-lead ECG.	0.7395898430300809
The TropT-rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 11% (specifity 94,3%).	0.4915180400120421
The TropT sensitive-rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 62% (specifity 100%).	0.49003790503626676
Despite the great number of publications during the last 10 years concerning the indication, technique and results of operative treatment of acetabular fractures, conservative treatment still has an important role when considering the therapeutic possibilities.	0.6993771286010096
Because of the modern techniques of radiological imaging and improvement of diagnostic facilities, a more defined indication for treatment becomes possible.	0.6879870682441654
Conventional X-rays, completed by special projections like the Ala and Obturator view, and a CT scan allow determination of the fracture type (the Letournel/Judet classification or the AO classification).	0.7113726368632699
The most suitable treatment can then be adapted to the individual circumstances of the patient, i. e., age, general condition and overall severity of traumatic impairment.	0.6001544148336552
Determination of the intact part of the weight-bearing dome is important in selecting the most adequate therapeutic procedure.	0.554442326435253
The larger the intact roof arc, the better the prognosis.	0.4778130518307032
Together with the X-ray controls following axial and facultative lateral extentions, the indication for conservative treatment can be confirmed.	0.6681668954146462
Early active motion of the injured limb, followed by walking exercises with partial weight-bearing, are important aspects of nonoperative treatment.	0.618668825158223
Conservative treatment is recommended in non-displaced fractures or in fractures with little displacement, transverse fractures of the lower region or severely comminuted acetabular fractures with no possibility of reconstruction.	0.6253372913398781
Our clinical and radiological follow-up of 97 patients with acetabular fractures from the years 1981-1990 showed that the majority were treated conservatively (approx.	0.6707420898624413
The functional result after an average observation period of more than 70 months was good or excellent (based on the Merle d'Aubigné score).	0.6323463315353383
We feel it is important to look at operative and conservative treatment of acetabular fractures as two complementary non-competitive therapeutic methods.	0.5310870213434513
The choice of treatment should be based on an exact diagnosis considering fracture type, the individual circumstances of the patient, and application of the necessary diagnostic facilities.	0.826920784496966
Conservative treatment can lead to excellent long-term results.	0.5763305032088705
Problem There is a great need to expand current knowledge of the various functional capacity measurements used in the rehabilitation of chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients.	0.7238546617463735
The literature on these patients reports that mobility, endurance, trunk strength and lifting capacity decrease during the process of chronicity.	0.5398977205211102
Chronically disabled patients appear to have lower functional capacity than asymptomatic persons.	0.361264064777934
Methods Our study group consisted of 90 disabled CLBP patients (44 female, 46 male; average age 42 years) who underwent a multidisciplinary 8-week daily treatment program of functional restoration with behavioral support (instruction, endurance training, strength exercises, behavioral and treatment to facilitate return to work therapy).	0.6033655289146267
Initially these patients where compared with 107 asymptomatic persons (44 female, 63 male, average age 41 years).	0.5022564928490187
The patients were investigated before and after treatment, and at intervals of 6 and 12 months.	0.9747385580036191
The reliability of the functional measurements was evaluated by interrater comparison.	0.6609071091944325
Physical assessment included a medical examination (mainly diagnosis of radicular or nonradicular pain), changes in the lumbar spine revealed by X-ray studies according to Herron and Turner [50], rating of physical impairment according to Waddell [117], flexibility, length of hamstrings muscles (SLR), test of power and endurance of trunk movement by standardized exercises according to the Swiss group of Spring [102] and isokinetic measurements (LIDO Back), tests of lifting capacity (LIDO Lift), and (in part) of general endurance on a cycle ergometer (CASE 15 Marquette).	0.568561996069253
Results Physical findings showed that mobility was reduced substantially in patients suffering from back pain due to reduced SLR (shortened hamstrings) and decreased spinal mobility.	0.4899945336574857
Patients also demonstrated significant reductions in their ability to perform lifting tasks in comparison to healthy individuals.	0.5012985442723559
The results of trunk flexion showed no significant differences between patients and the control group, whereas the ability to perform trunk extension was much better in the control group.	0.7737198870116294
In principle we found the same results with isokinetic measurements as in the exercises without machines.	0.6165092526492052
Cardiovascular endurance was also much better in the control group than it was in the back pain patients.	0.5261001538095296
At the end of the treatment program all physical deficits were improved significantly.	0.5253490150816641
In many cases performance was comparable with that of the control group.	0.6906102420656247
With time, however, training effects gradually decreased.	0.4413883766344196
The success of treatment (return to work, absence from work, pain reduction, use of medical care) was independent of the functional status of the patients before and after treatment.	0.8899994258390332
Conclusion Study results showed that physical capacity in disabled patients with low back pain is substantially reduced in comparison to persons who do not suffer from back pain.	0.6451629207087772
The only exception was in trunk flexor strength and endurance, in which measurements did not differ between the patients and the control group.	0.8629957745713541
However, even CLBP- patients with long-term pain and severe physical illness can successfully improve their physical condition by participating in an active treatment program.	0.6099586250764287
Back extensor muscle training has to be included in physical therapy.	0.49937510333958385
Because of loss of condition during the time after treatment, regular monitoring of patients and their home training programs is necessary.	0.6647950501487933
Overall, treatment of CLBP has to include physical training and psychosocial treatment to achieve satisfactory results.	0.534022350021344
The dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain is very complex and is frequency-dependent.	0.4601275708554556
To date, this has still not been fully investigated or understood.	0.6146079639859714
There remains a lack of measurement procedures to pick up the motion of the ossicles and ear drum simultaneously with sufficient resolution.	0.4707628085917743
The presented paper reports simultanous measurements with laser-Doppler vibrometry at two points of the ossicular chain of cadaver specimens.	0.4430209379037288
Motions not observed were derived using mechanical simulation models on a computer and then evaluating appropriate mathematical equations.	0.3311170969689267
Using a sound stimulus, the displacement velocities of the umbo and stapes footplate were measured, and the corresponding transfer functions were derived by Fourier transform.	0.5561376945717043
Results were used for verification of the computer models.	0.5558488909370235

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are probably not only unintended, toxic side-products of oxygen metabolism in mammalian cells, they also have several important physiologic functions including antimicrobial killing, regulation of cellular proliferation and growth, and regulation of vascular tone.	0.5900191823352713
ROS are generated within the vessel wall by several mechanisms, including a vascular type of a NAD(P)H oxidase.	0.6101465283359367
ROS formation can be stimulated by mechanical stress, environmental factors, the peptide angiotensin II, cytokines, native low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and in the presence of catalytic metal ions.	0.6372913962515842
Their ability to modify LDL, react with endothelial-derived nitric oxide subsequently forming peroxynitrite, and amplify the expression of various genes important for leukocyte recruitment within the arterial wall are the basis of the oxidant injury theory of atherosclerosis.	0.4735912604030129
In animal studies, antioxidant therapy (probucol, butylated hydroxytoluene, N',N'-diphenylendiamide, vitamin E, superoxide dismutase) have been successfully used to prevent fatty streak formation, and to restore impaired nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation.	0.5989272224664894
In man, antioxidant therapy (e.g., supplementation with vitamin E) clearly increased the resistance of LDL to oxidative modification.	0.372237451215677
Case-controlled and prospective clinical studies suggest a relation between baseline antioxidant plasma levels and/or antioxidant supplementation and risk of cardiovascular events.	0.47748243638899174
In one secondary prevention trial (randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled), vitamin E supplementation reduced significantly the risk for non-fatal myocardial infarctions.	0.5358540680726445
Before general recommendations can be made, results of further large-scale trials should be awaited.	0.5790755663652777

At the moment there is no consensus about the pathogenesis of RSD.	0.6513448597149775
In 1942 Paul Sudeck suggested that the signs and symptoms of RSD may be provoked by an exaggerated inflammatory response to injury or operation of an extremity.	0.4907500381128406
His theory found no disciples, as most physicians believe that RSD is initiated by an hyperactive sympathetic system.	0.4923870451606887

The Intended-Dynamic Group Therapy, until the unity almost unknown in West-Germany, represented the most important form of therapy in the former GDR.	0.6122789810539154
Its development, its conception of the relevant relationship between group-dynamic and psychoanalytic concepts and in particular its reception of psychoanalytic concepts are discussed.	0.5544893091431504
This raises the question of defining the position of this therapy form with the focus on the controverse about its proximity to psychoanalytic therapeutical concepts.	0.5671121038023091
Even if we take into account that in the GDR there were very reduced possibilities to articulate psychoanalytic and particularly drive concepts, in our view the Intended-Dynamic Group Therapy cannot be considered as a psychoanalytical form of therapy.	0.6993428424377823
It represents a specific therapeutical development of the former GDR which is strongly oriented at social norms.	0.5638081189687328
It is first of all oriented at the attitude change reached by the group, that means, at the manifest, conscious behaviour of the patient and therefore focusses at the normative level of behaviour regulation in groups in the sense of interactional group therapy.	0.6099084916579238
The authors view this form of therapy as a "historical compromise" in the field of psychotherapy under the circumstances of the former GDR and in this way they take into account both its advantages and its weaknesses.	0.7108802769589788
In a prospective study of central fractures of the talus, radiological data (plain radiography, CT, MRI) were scrutinized in terms of correlation with histological findings (biopsy taken at time of screw removal).	0.7346462179258938
The study looked at nine fractures in eight patients aged 14 - 48 years.	0.5421861021825847
There was one fracture of Hawkins type I, one fracture of type II, four fractures of type III, and three corpus fractures.	0.8167477591336506
All were operated on within 24 h after injury; seven had screw fixation, two had adaptation with K wires.	0.5595343934542912
The patients were kept non-weight-bearing for 14 - 53 weeks.	0.771297356214114
Duration of follow-up was 2 years or more in all but one patient.	0.7728225769248135
In the final radiograph the talus was intact in four patients, while four showed a partial avascular collapse; in one patient, a partial collapse was doubtful.	0.8064645045513138
Histology taken 16 - 52 weeks after injury showed osteocyte-free original bone in all cases, with deposition of new bone varying in extent.	0.5699902441650517
Hawkins sign was partially positive in six patients, positive in one, and negative in one.	0.6251835818092354
Decalcification as well as fracture healing can be better followed by CT than by plain radiography.	0.5158199236416959
MRI appeared normal in five patients, partially pathological in two, and abnormal in one.	0.6415007719218742
A positive Hawkins sign and normal signal behavior can be seen as prognostically favorable signs.	0.4702042928874477
However, in the case of a central talus fracture, even with a favorable course osteonecrosis of at least a part of the talus with gradual replacement by new bone occurred.	0.8233886933305897
Vascularization of the central talus seems to be disturbed more frequently than is reflected radiologically.	0.6494093009632829
Purpose: To assess the value of functional magnetic resonance urography for the noninvasive postoperative evaluation of renal transplants.	0.5410363972544651

Using the IKDC score led to 3 very good and 4 good results, 2 fair and 6 bad results.	0.5452765236226003
Using subjective criteria, 10 patients described results as very good or good, 2 fair and 3 bad.	0.6583801661205945
Posterior cruciate ligament rupture with additional knee injury or fracture of the leg showed bad results in 60 % of cases, and good or fair results in only 40 %.	0.6533050455388665
We think augmented repair of fresh injury of the posterior cruciate ligament can be used as an alternative therapy to reconstruction with autograft.	0.7753135576426097
Through cooperation between the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK), results of standardized patch tests performed by the participating centres are centrally recorded in Germany.	0.5761989696472296
For this study, data from 24 departments of dermatology (19678 patients) were evaluated retrospectively and separately for 1995 and 1996.	0.7075098987340803
With decreasing frequency, nickel, fragrance mix, balsam of peru, and thimerosal yielded positive reactions most often; suprisingly high numbers of positive reactions were also seen with amerchol L-101 and palladium.	0.44044248209474224
Differentiated lists of allergens were compiled for 1995, referring to subgroups of patients (defined by gender, age, localization of eczema, geographical region, occupation, sensitization) and particular problems.	0.5619374625624003
In men, percentages of positive reactions were markedly lower for nickel, fragrance mix and balsam of peru than in women.	0.3663566934997703
Younger patients reacted more often to thimerosal and older ones to topical medical preparations.	0.3003518342002718
Medical allergens were also often positive in patients with leg eczema, whereas occupational allergens were found more frequently in patients with hand eczema.	0.6522947737338362
A comparison of positive reactions obtained in distinct geographical regions was problematic because of differences between test populations.	0.4671139946095046
The spectrum of allergens found in officeworkers was similar to that of the whole test population.	0.6527617244606001
Patients with positive reactions to nickel and fragrance mix had more positive reactions to unrelated allergens than the total test population.	0.517889286198998
Sex- and age-adjusted frequencies of sensitization revealed a decrease in reactions to nickel and an increase in reactions to mercury allergens from 1995 to 1996.	0.5604295493978952
The clinical relevance of mercury reactions was often not apparent.	0.40194032456867307

Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin (BT) induce a localized, long-lasting paresis of the target muscle that can be graded by the BT dose administered and that is free of major side effects.	0.5641774399821504
With this profile, BT can be used for symptomatic treatment of various disorders caused by pathological muscle hyperactivities.	0.6040553143624767
These disorders occur frequently in patients in institutions for neurological rehabilitation.	0.4932086519192654
They are difficult to treat with conventional methods, can cause major suffering and induce substantial costs for our health care system.	0.6011805293008821
In the present study we therefore sought to delineate the use of BT in rehabilitative neurology.	0.5580473627705631
Regardless of the etiology of the particular muscle hyperactivity syndrome, five main indication groups are identified: (1) improvement of function of the hyperactive muscles; (2) relief of pain in the hyperactive muscles; (3) improvement of patient care; (4) avoidance of sequelae in joints, tendons, ligaments, and teeth; (5) various special indications.	0.6643062424963406
Myocardial infarction shows a circadian pattern with a maximum in the early morning hours.	0.6087254297922248
In patients with sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD), it is assumed that apnea-associated changes of hemodynamics, blood gases, and rheology lead to a higher frequency of myocardial infarction during sleep.	0.737106731117364
This investigation analyzes the circadian pattern of myocardial infarction in patients with and without SRBD.	0.5876116636180502

Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with shortened action potential duration (APD) and reduced atrial refractoriness.	0.6066378958113648
Remodeling of ion currents responsible for AP morphology has been proposed as a major mechanism in persistent AF.	0.45416843896672093
In the present study we investigated the activity of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel and the mRNA transcription of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel subunits in patients with persistent AF compared to patients in sinus rhythm (SR).	0.6667859143724268
Right atrial appendages of 10 patients in SR and of 5 patients with AF were used for myocyte isolations to record L-type Ca2+ currents (ICa,L) by the patch-clamp technique.	0.6523313774265911
Right atrial appendages of 16 patients in SR and of 5 patients with AF served as sources for determining the mRNA expression of the L-type Ca2+ channel 1c-, 2/-, a-, and b/c-subunits by semiquantitative RT-PCR.	0.6515180053136114
ICa,L density was reduced by 70% (p < 0.001) in AF patients compared to the sinus rhythm group.	0.6819903590486207
Cell sizes, expressed as cell capacitance, were identical in both groups.	0.5287996612228107
mRNA expressions of the 1c-subunit and the b/c-subunits were reduced in AF patients by 18.9% (p < 0.05) and 77.7% (p < 0.005), respectively, while mRNA transcriptions of the 2/- and the a-subunits were not significantly different between SR and AF patients.	0.6680174007904197
A decrease in the availability of functional L-type Ca2+ channels in AF patients, due to reduced 1c-subunit and substantial lack of b/c-subunit transcription seems to contribute to the shortening pf APD and refractory periods in AF, thereby favoring increased atrial excitation rate and perpetuation of AF.	0.5067564361901679
34 patients aged 3 months to 20years underwent transcatheter-occlusion of their patent ductus arteriosus with detachable coils (Cook).	0.43031120191319105
Eight patients had a residual ductus after previous implantation of a Rashkind-occluder; 7 patients had various other cardiac malformations in addition.	0.5670972031450879
Only 6 patients had a large ductus with a diameter between 3 and 4 mm; all had systolic-diastolic murmurs.	0.6684364170116511
All other patients had ductus-diameters below 3 mm; three of them had systolic-diastolic murmurs, 17 had systolic murmurs, and 8 patients had no murmur at all.	0.6418243937415145
The ductus was closed in 24 patients using artrial access only, in 6 patients via a venous, and in 4 patients both via venous and arterial catheterization.	0.817275611266071
One coil was used in 23 patients, 2 coils in 9, and 3 coils in 2 patients.	0.9063925367977645
There were no complications of the intervention.	0.7777163004474075
Within 24 hours 31 patients (93%) had complete closure of the ductus and 32 patients (94%) after 6 months.	0.6805666864673453
Coil-embolisation of the persistent ductus is a quick, safe and cheap method to close a ductus and has clear advantages compared to an operation.	0.5020008696650242
The volume of preoperative screening investigations for outpatient anaesthesia ranges from few, selectively ordered investigations to extensive routine diagnostic procedures.	0.43297406808991346
It seem appropriate to reevaluate benefit and efficacy of routine preoperative assessment programs.	0.3834154621998033
The purpose of preoperative diagnostic is to assess the risk of anaesthesia and surgery for the patient.	0.8690264967308494
As shown by a number of studies, preoperative screening investigations seldom disclose new pathological findings of clinical relevance.	0.6458118066935475
Abnormal laboratory results in otherwise healthy patients rarely alter the anaesthetic management of the patient and are not related to perioperative complications.	0.7069922503540363
Extensive use of costly diagnostic procedures considerably increases health care budgets.	0.2974823860072927
A more selective approach to order preoperative investigations promises considerable savings.	0.3557505695144292
To achieve costeffective evalulation an efficient organisation of properative assessment must be established to avoid costly delay and on-day-of-surgery-cancellations.	0.45152239473871353
There is no medicolegal obligation to perform routine diagnostic testing.	0.4452169901990662
The anaesthetist must be sufficiently informed in time to assess the perioperative risk of the patient and to alter anaesthetic management as necessary.	0.7684703577156938
According to the presented studies a clinical history and a thorough physical examination represent an effective method of screening for the presence of disease.	0.6699654904311827
Careful medical history evaluation and physical examination can avoid extensive investigations in apparently healthy individuals and the latter should only be ordered if indicated.	0.41440092774477144
The botryoid odontogenic cyst (BOC) is considered a rare multilocular variant of the lateral periodontal cyst.	0.6783792500417387
The origin of the BOC can be seen in aberrant odontogenic tissue.	0.5925125211577692
The BOC is found especially in the premolar region of the mandible, as well as in the frontal region of the maxilla of patients aged between 60 and 70 years.	0.8385577092498296
Most of the 11 published articles of BOC have shown high rates of recurrence.	0.47016143845252234
Histopathologically the BOC is marked by multilocular cysts lined by a thin, nonkeratinized epithelium.	0.37163600764959187
Clusters of glycogen-rich epithelial cells may be noted in nodular thickenings of the cyst lining.	0.438868141985122
For the clinician, the differentiation of the BOC from the keratocyst and ameloblastoma is relevant.	0.6163486119383289
One case of a large BOC (65-year-old male, BOC regio 33-45, diameter 5 cm, radiographically and histologically multilocular) is presented with a review of the literature, including the therapeutic management, and the possible diagnostic criteria are discussed.	0.8551183154953426
The immunohistochemically determined expression of cytokeratin (CK) 13 implicates the histogenetic origin of the BOC from the squamous epithelium of the oral cavity and excludes the origin from the small salivary glands.	0.48491283645659344
The expression of CK 19 and the lack of expression of p53, as well as the higher proliferation rate of the basal epithelial cell layer by the BOC, may be useful for distinction between the keratocyst.	0.6551900085251183
Within the framework of a study on vocational rehabilitation of the mentally ill, we examined 83 schizophrenic outpatients enrolled in a work therapy program.	0.6250109385566096
The course of illness and rehabilitation was documented over a 3-year period by means of annual follow-up examinations.	0.7826170974020729
The sample comprised 44 men and 39 women with an average age of 35 years (SD +/- 8,5).	0.6561107153329682
The majority were chronically ill patients with a history of frequent and long psychiatric hospitalization.	0.5664586701874351
After 3 years, 22% of the patients were integrated into the general labor market, 26% had sheltered employment, 23% were still in work therapy, and 29% were unemployed.	0.9405110916957297
Besides the patients' subjective expectations, early introduction of rehabilitative measures and a favourable course of illness were found to be predictors of a successful rehabilitation leading to vocational integration.	0.641290719091988
Outpatient work therapy is a contemporary, effective organizational form of sociotherapy.	0.519906249757909
It may contribute to improved vocational competence and integration, reduced psychiatric hospitalization and stabilized psychopathology.	0.4996757391397503
Objective: Based on personal observations the neuromuscular blocking potency of atracurium was supposed to be diminished in purulent intrathoracic diseases.	0.422386832244903
This hypothesis was tested in a prospective clinical trial.	0.7796314156713536
Aim of study: Goal of this survey is to give an overview of anaesthesia for caesarean section in Germany.	0.6839725798173524
Ultrasound contrast agent is used in color Doppler flow imaging for signal enhancement in perfused vessels.	0.44684072439958766
We present our experience with its use in the head and neck area and the results obtained.	0.970931071687059
Up until now, 30 patients with carcinomas of the oral cavity or the maxillary sinus, tumors of the mandible and metastatic or inflammatory lymph nodes have been examined.	0.6745683920471934
Conventional B-scan sonography was supplemented by non-contrast color Doppler flow imaging.	0.4130167035143933
Depending on the indication, 2.5 g Levovist in bolus or 4 g fractionated was injected intravenously in a concentration of 300 or 400 mg/ml.	0.5936228781024959
The administration of the contrast agent was tolerated by all patients without any side effects and in all cases led to a remarkable enhancement of the Doppler signals.	0.8046576958448048
About 15 to 30 s after injection, an enhancement in perfused vessels was detected.	0.5048066636839321
The fractioned injection of 4 g led to a lengthening of signal enhancement up to more than 10 min and to the possibility of examining more parts with a single application of contrast agent.	0.6444316498369682
In 64% of the lymph nodes, vessels could only be identified with the administration of Levovist.	0.6150664654264175
The general vessel topography could be better evaluated in 83% of the cases.	0.5179894463134527
The lymph-node-supplying vessels were identified in 8 of 11 patients after the injection of contrast media.	0.7314886505133076
Additional information, which was gained in 17 patients, increased the certainty of diagnosis or of the therapeutic concept.	0.936705847338531
In three cases, the examinations with the signal enhancer resulted in a change in therapy.	0.6897007379547725
By applying signal enhancer in color Doppler sonography the fields of examination in the head and neck areas can be expanded.	0.4649921062227054
Non-syndromic neurosensory recessive deafness (NSRD) is one of the most common human sensory disorders.	0.6378469308891629
Mutations in the connexin 26 gene have been established as a major cause of inherited and sporadic non-syndromic deafness in different populations.	0.5590168287339481
Laser-induced thermotherapy is an in situ ablation method for the local treatment of liver tumors.	0.6641326952592235
The basic prerequisite for induction of adequate treatment volumes for clinical use was the development of a thermostable application system.	0.5258896976042436
In an ex vivo test series, the specially developed application system (diffuser tip) with 5760 J had a higher thermic loading capacity than the Ringmode applicator with 4200 J, thus enabling the induction of significantly larger lesions with a volume of 7.6 cm3.	0.5907620330105451
The results of a further in vivo test series demonstrated that the lesions were subject to a four-phase connective-tissue organization within a 6-month period.	0.7211876968000139
Furthermore, the same laser energy (4200 J) was associated with a significantly lower lesion volume of 2.5 cm3 in the in vivo than in the ex vivo test series.	0.7977901312409387
The influence of liver perfusion on the inducible lesion volume was examined in a further animal experimental study.	0.523947276119887
By temporarily interrupting hepatic blood perfusion (Pringle's maneuver) during laser application, the effective volume could be increased to 50.3 cm3 (P < 0.01) using an optical beam splitter.	0.5949755518097067
These results show that the technical prerequisites for reliable clinical application of laser-induced thermotherapy have been fulfilled.	0.6601394641863867
A total of 222 urogenital specimens were investigated with a commercially available polymerase chain reaction (Amplicor test) for the direct detection of Chlamydia trachomatis.	0.6278561220194935
The results were compared with those yielded by the conventional cell culture technique.	0.6261846999444434
Using cell culture a urogenital C. trachomatis infection could be detected in 72 of 222 patients.	0.5874352543520892
The Amplicor test yielded a positive result in 83.	0.3961802875267354
Referred to the detection rate of the Amplicor test and that of the cell culture, sensitivity was 91.2% for the test sensitivity and 79.1% for the cell culture.	0.8950760372701652
The specificity of both techniques was 100% when the specimens for which neither both nor either one of the tests gave positive results were considered.	0.6414684169059354
In accordance with other studies, this study suggests that tests based on nucleic acid amplification will supersede cell cultures as the gold standard for the detection of C. trachomatis and also become the method of choice in routine diagnosis of urogenital chamydial infections.	0.6525545807771689
Incidence and clinical significance of cardiopulmonary complications of acute cerebral lesions are still unclear.	0.5887796455055884
Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is characterized as an acute, protein-rich lung edema occurring shortly after cerebral lesions associated with an acute rise of intracranial pressure.	0.7113511225323045
NPE is infrequently diagnosed, usually in association with head trauma.	0.4925468629031574
Pathophysiological mechanisms include a rise of the pulmonary vascular hydrostatic pressure either due to sympathetic innervation with pulmonary vasoconstriction or increased left-atrial pressure following systemic arterial hypertension or an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability.	0.5316526135654323
In contrast to NPE, cardiac complications are frequently observed, most consistently in patients with subarachoid hemorrhage.	0.6898505392437961
Typical ECG changes are repolarization abnormalities, similar to those observed in coronary heart disease, and cardiac arrhythmias.	0.6552777819031053
The CK-MB may be slightly elevated; echocardiographic findings show a depressed left-ventricular function.	0.36805608344104207
Pathological examination reveals myofibrillar necrosis.	0.18702876198216437
Cardiac complications are explained with overactivity of the sympathetic innervation and high levels of circulating catecholamines.	0.48756947987652355
For adequate treatment, close cardiac monitoring is required in all patients with acute cerebral lesions.	0.9066873893273701
Benign, non-parasitic liver cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally by abdominal ultrasound or CT scan.	0.37495783923871845
We present the case of a 68-year-old patient who showed obstructive jaundice due to a hemorrhagic liver cyst compressing the choledochal duct.	0.5516209293952549
Due to the location of the cyst in the porta hepatis with partial compression of central liver vessels and the meanwhile organized hematoma, operative therapy was preferred in order to prevent secondary complications such as portal vein thrombosis and to exclude a malignant neoplasm.	0.6387888468734126
This review summarizes briefly pathophysiology, clinical definitions, pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnostic procedures and principles of therapy and prophylaxis of ischemic stroke.	0.6972209820785511
Ischemic stroke is defined as a localized lack of cerebral perfusion mainly due to cardioembolic or arterial-embolic occlusion of cerebral arteries or hemodynamic or microangiographic reduction of cerebral blood flow.	0.480575882036646
We focused on pathophysiological mechanisms with potential clinical relevance as the role of oxygen and glucose concentration, the therapeutic time window, the role of excitatory neurotransmitters, Ca2+-influx, free radicals, and the development of ischemic brain edema.	0.6598811633329796
Based on this data the need of an urgent initiation of diagnostic workup and therapy is emphasized.	0.6398712974756136
This includes the early basic management with monitoring of blood pressure, ECG, oxygen and blood glucose concentration, and the balance of the water and electrolyte supply.	0.7043851738122736
Since specific therapeutic and prophylactic interventions are based on an exact diagnosis with respect to the pathogenesis, the need of an urgent diagnostic workup including clinical examination, laboratory baseline, vascular ultrasound, cranial CT-scan, ECG, and echocardiography is emphazised.	0.7583831286690829
Based on these results appropriate management of certain pathogenetic stroke subgroups is discussed.	0.4322481758131791
New data about the effectiveness of basic care, treatment of edema, neuroprotective agents, and thrombolysis is presented.	0.6357075134323833
Indications for the therapy with intravenous heparin, vitamin K-antagonists, antiplatelet drugs, and surgical procedures are summarized.	0.8231014342190928
Longitudinal osteocutaneous defects of the sternal region including the caudal third were reconstructed in 15 patients during a 3-year period by using the "vertical (VRAM)- and transverse rectus abdominis muscle" (TRAM) flap.	0.663074738799043
The majority of the defects resulted from chronic osteomyelitis after previous cardiothoracic surgery or were due to former therapy of breast cancer.	0.5293374882672212
Three VRAM/TRAM flaps were primarily transferred as free flaps with microvascular anastomosis in the axilla region.	0.33024433599531045
Nine out of 12 pedicled VRAM or TRAM flaps required an additional microvascular anastomosis because of imminent venous or arterial insufficency ("supercharging").	0.44158138397123364
Therefore, operative technique and operating time of the pedicled and free flap for reconstruction of longitudinal sternal defects are comparable.	0.6232568548168167
Adequate reconstruction and rehabilitation was achieved in 11 cases.	0.6967251478469171
In 2 patients revision and partial secondary defect coverage was required.	0.4124584473278215
Two male patients died postoperatively due to their preexisting condition.	0.48141613986015114
The introduction of joints in unilateral fixators enables these for multiple deformity corrections.	0.30516524824448304
Lengthening and shortening is achieved by changing the length of the fixator telescope.	0.4920229252767681
Axial corrections are performed by additive or subtractive techniques using uniplanar joints or by angulation procedures.	0.35314862665551777
Translation is done by direct movements of the bone fragments or by metaphyseal "double angulation".	0.5821744589576512
Derotation preferably is done as an acute procedure or in the "ring part" of a hybrid frame.	0.7268411671522602
Unilateral fixators are used to correct and temporarily stabilize until the correction is held by the nintramedullary nail.	0.4402426722225534
Pathomorphology in the preterm infant represents an interaction of morphological organ immaturity and neonatal management with their respective sequelae.	0.38691712162725195
Background: Morphological changes in the corneal surface after PRK may result not only in refraction fluctuations and reduction in visual acuity, but also in changes of contrast sensitivity.	0.6850076409733579
The aim of this study was to investigate whether PRK has an influence on contrast sensitivity with and without glare with a subsequent effect on the ability to drive cars.	0.6077769483145377
Calcifying obliterative atherosclerosis isolated within the descending thoracic aorta causing subtotal vascular occlusion was associated with symptoms such as in aortic coarctation in a 56-year-old patient.	0.46556502961481316
Remarkable in this unique case is the atypical and isolated manifestation of atherosclerotic disease within the thoracic aorta, as well as the tumorous extent of luminal calcification.	0.5171610178289535
Differential diagnostic considerations had to include calcifying tumor of the aorta, remnants after aortitis or secondary calcified aortic dissection.	0.5016679725204657
The osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with obliteration of the sinus has been established in the therapy of frontal sinus diseases that can not be drainaged permanently or healed through an endonasal access.	0.5853038573706688
The obliteration of the frontal sinus is endangered in cases of multiple fracturing of the posterior frontal sinus wall or if it has been destroyed by an inflammatory process.	0.6591842441858972
In these problematic cases obliteration bears the danger of complications and cranialization of the frontal sinus is therefore the method of choice.	0.6223469663227466
We review 8 patients who were operated on using the cranialization technique.	0.5091423904546242
Indications for surgery were a combined fracture of the anterior and posterior frontal sinus wall (3), a pyocele of the front sinus with extensive destruction of the posterior wall (4) and a large osteoma of the posterior frontal sinus wall (1).	0.7440815572985329
The frontal sinus was exposed through a coronal incision, the mucosa and the posterior wall were completely removed and the frontal sinus obliterated with fat tissue.	0.7381066178139803
The anterior sinus wall was replaced after obliteration of the sinus or reconstructed with calvarian bone transplants.	0.42151003619559657
The follow up period was 1.8 years (11 months to 8 years).	0.8895320145246295
All patients underwent postoperatively a clinical ENT-examination and radiological assessment by CT-scan or MRI.	0.6323380718211443
The overall functional and esthetic outcome was excellent.	0.30453940621565034
There were no serious complications nor any recurrence.	0.523771059474494
The cranialization of the frontal sinus is a reliable and safe variation of the classical osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with fat obliteration.	0.6676585606707311
We present the case of an infant with Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, in whom keloids developed at the sites of intracutanous bleeding within 6 months after the illness.	0.7019842495478874
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) belongs to the category of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA).	0.3980062763137863
The clinical picture is characterised by progressive ataxia and macular degeneration.	0.5200926029889057
Other common signs are slow saccades, external ophthalmoplegia, and pyramidal tract signs.	0.5055766872177211
The disease is caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat in the gene for ataxin 7 on chromosome 3.	0.5974778650338735
SCA7 is a rare disorder.	0.7767750071173095
The first case in Germany was described only recently.	0.6878126935579749
We report two additional patients, father and son, with the molecular genetic diagnosis of SCA7.	0.75696617308948
The father carries a trinucleotide expansion of 42 CAG repeats, the son 51.	0.4070281635293469
Normal alleles range from 7 to 35 CAG repeats.	0.3070283265355647
Both patients show the typical picture with progressive ataxia and macular degeneration.	0.44154510387828105
We found a pronounced anticipation (earlier disease onset in subsequent generations), which is highly characteristic of CAG repeat disorders.	0.5765962536651371
In the following contribution the under-proportional participation rate of older workers in vocational training is analysized.	0.4766218102480775
Regarding the changes concerning the organiszation of vocational training to more job-integrated, self-directed and computerbased learning the consequences for training opportunities, motivation to learn and performance possibilities as well as institutional basic conditions to optimize the participation of elderly workers in further training are discussed.	0.41272099653435634
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most severe arbovirus disease transmitted by ticks.	0.6783710043162743
The mortality of the central European form is 0.7-2%.	0.875107364367112
Active immunisation is recommended for endemic regions.	0.43036542188855664
We report on 4 patients with TBE aquired in Middle-Hessen between 1994 and 1997 (2 in 1997).	0.7475504967029676
After repeated CSF and serum testing the TBE-specific antibodies were found in all 4 cases.	0.5466897849778904
In one case there was also evidence for a prior infection with borrelia burgdorferi.	0.6488597429133657
The results of the initial CSF-analysis were atypical in 2 cases (high cell count of 136 cells/mm3, total protein up to 1.5 g/l).	0.7981891010126331
The endemic region for TBE has expanded in northern direction into Middle-Hessen, a region in which Lyme borreliosis is also endemic.	0.4194693261827861
Thus, true double infections are possible.	0.31966792985836306
This and the initially frequently atypical CSF-findings make the differential diagnosis difficult.	0.4525868841406613
Therefore, repetitive CSF and blood examinations are recommended.	0.4935509228565112
Nedocromil sodium and cromolyn sodium are non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of asthma.	0.49970458119061595
Although they are chemically different, there are many similarities in their mechanism of action.	0.6555083969907285
In provocation tests they have equal efficacy on some tests (allergen, exercise), but nedocromil sodium has greater effect on neuronal mechanisms such as So2 challenge.	0.4423258290985932
Very few studies compared the two drugs.	0.4283646818662584
In children, only one study was done, showing that twice daily nedocromil is as effective as four times daily cromolyn sodium.	0.5834837801381298
Thus twice daily administration is one advantage of nedocromil, the other being proven effect of steroid- sparing, which has not been shown with cromolyn sodium.	0.6636317487791363
Both drugs are recommended as first-line agents in mild persistent asthma.	0.583148645640802
Background: We evaluated in this retrospective study the impact of our diagnostic and therapeutic regimens - as illustrated by typical clinical pictures - on the frequency and prognostic values of postkeratoplasty complications in herpes eyes.	0.7758435055534899
The evaluation of brain tumor recurrence and therapy-induced benign changes following surgery and/or irradiation is a diagnostic challenge for imaging methods based on either morphology (cCT/MRI) or function (SPECT/PET).	0.6010861305609296
Current literature and the present data of our own patients demonstrate the diagnostic efficiency of IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET in the detection of recurrence and in-vivo grading.	0.6198308258549168
Thirty-nine patients suspected of brain tumor recurrence at follow-up were studied by FDG-PET and IMT-SPECT.	0.5971852500740497
Thirty-four of 39 patients showed recurrences; in 12 cases even a change in the grade of malignancy was observed.	0.6835168446207199
All high-grade recurrences could be confirmed by either methods.	0.6183193854711521
IMT-SPECT showed a higher sensitivity in detecting low-grade tumors at recurrence.	0.5885572173990732
In contrast to IMT-SPECT, FDG-PET supports sufficient in-vivo grading.	0.4913364067145484
Both methods can be used to differentiate between tumor recurrence and radionecrosis.	0.7169402310112883
In conclusion the results of our study demonstrate the efficiency of IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET in confirming recurrences and determining the actual tumor grade.	0.6134766935394739
A 22-year-old male presented with a submandibular cystic mass in the ENT Clinic of Berlin-Buch.	0.696605566561483
Histopathology revealed a dystopic papillary carcinoma in a thyroglossal duct cyst.	0.33748301082035637
Worldwide only about 150 cases are known.	0.27579516784041824
We describe our diagnostic and therapeutic procedures employed and included tumor excision, bilateral neck dissections and total thyroidectomy.	0.5615322778736237
No abnormalities in the thyroid gland but a metastatic carcinoma was uncovered in an ipsilateral lymph node in the jugular foramen area.	0.47761333494119346
A preoperative 99 Tc-thyroid scan and MRI study had not shown any evidence for a malignant tumor.	0.4365903855308247
The therapeutic approach advocated in literature is controversial but the intraoperative findings in our patient supported our decision to choose a relatively radical but not mutilating therapy.	0.523200890702776
Transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) is a pleiotrophic growth factor in carcinogenesis and regulars multiple cell functions.	0.5971125871928442
We wanted to evaluate the diagnostic meaning of TGF-1 plasma levels in patients with a biopsy proven prostate cancer.	0.6880645388897627
The TGF-1 blood level was analysed in 394 patients.	0.43815812306895446
In 242 patients (group I) the blood was taken before any prostate manipulation and biopsy.	0.7150398217304504
The TGF-1 plasma concentrations were almost similar in the group of patients with a prostate cancer (n = 157) and patients with a benign prostate hyperplasia (n = 85; 14 258 pg/ml versus 14 658 pg/ml, SD 10 516 pg/ml).	0.6923997401326963
In 152 patients the blood was taken 6-12 months after radical prostatectomy (group II).	0.6687289646569593
There was no significant difference between the patients with a PSA-progress and without PSA-progress after.	0.7631437196640376
Our results suggest that TGF-1 plasma levels can not be used to distinguish between patients with prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia.	0.6953982077400966
The aim of this study was to compare the psychological stress of patients with different forms of immediate type hypersensitivity and urticaria.	0.6924139399152027
Moreover, the patients' motivation for different forms of psychological treatment was assessed and an indication for psychosocial support was defined.	0.7865789345164748
228 consecutive inpatients with insect venom allergies (ins), food intolerance (food), drug hypersensitivities (dru) and urticaria (urt) were evaluated by validated questionnaires regarding psychological strain and motivation for psychosocial treatments.	0.6165372691879409
Patients with food intolerance and urticaria showed significantly elevated psychological stress and higher motivation for psychosocial support as compared to those with insect venom allergies and drug intolerance.	0.5380875201318297
Patient education was the favourite technique for the patients (food 78%, urt 57%, dru 24%, ins 17%), followed by relaxation treatment.	0.5241107639709173
The most important predictors for the motivation were the wish for self-responsibility, a feeling of helplessness and social limitations.	0.5531938989010611
If strong indication criteria are applied, psychosocial support is indicated in only small subgroups of each patient group.	0.5854099211171957
In spite of that, the management of allergic disease should consider the potential need for psychosocial support.	0.6219455062701982
The definition of endocrine disrupters is not very sharp.	0.4602407701798662
At present all non-physiologic substances which bind to steroid receptors, are defined as endocrine disrupters of which the best studied are estrogenic in nature.	0.4685137157233634
Many pesticides or insecticides or their metabolites have estrogenic activity and pollute our surface water.	0.2520735517337129
Here they may cause severe estrogenization of aquatic life.	0.41403598780594386
Only traces of these substances are demonstrable in drinking water.	0.4381613099293023
On the other hand, weak estrogens present in plastic ware may be ingested by men and therefore be potentially harmful for human health.	0.3368465881077558
On the other hand, many plants produce socalled'hyto-estrogens', particularly soy products are rich in phyto-estrogens but their high consumption in Asian populations are most likely the reason for reduced occurrence of breast cancer.	0.5041746882205149
Many plant extracts used for human medication also contain phyto-estrogens and are beneficial in the treatment of climacteric complaints.	0.37473004376451063
Hence, not all endocrine disruptors must be harmful to human health, in fact, some of them (clearly phyto-estrogens) may have beneficial effects.	0.6854308220164649
Germany's new Protection against infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz) will take effect on January 1, 2001.	0.4112645163511217
It will result in an increase of notifications on reportable infections.	0.530844135989543
Counties and states have to adjust the infrastructure of their reportable disease notification systems to meet the demands of the new legislation.	0.4498626266256668
An increased demand for human resources at the non-medical staff level is anticipated.	0.4311533649259742
Continuing education programs for medical and non-medical staff at public health offices are mandatory.	0.47124751776732493
Physicians in private practice, hospitals and diagnostic laboratories and leaders of nursing homes are target groups for special information.	0.44736009768173146
A timely review and epidemiological evaluation of all notifications forwarded by county health offices has to be performed at the state level.This is a prerogative for immediate response in case of non-localized increases in reported disease incidence.	0.5873768028191212
The author advocates the development of an epidemiological rapid reaction scheme (epidemiological fire brigade) in which public health physicians at the county, state, and federal level cooperate in a gradual response to outbreak situations according to actual demand.	0.5718330933081789
We report on an 8 year old boy and a 12 year old girl with intermittent peranal loss of blood and mucus, impaired defecation and recurrent abdominal pain.	0.6768205951302136
On endoscopy isolated ulcers were seen in the rectum only, whereas the colonic mucosa appeared to be normal macroscopically and microscopically.	0.5764239869175529
Biopsies from the borders of the ulcers revealed a hyperplasia of the lamina muscularis mucosae and a fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria mucosae.	0.5253795696259065
These clinical, endoscopical and histological findings are characteristic for the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.	0.44911610288685694
Only 26 paediatric cases (age at diagnosis 6-9 years) have been published so far.	0.798832157612668
The interval from first symptoms to final diagnosis (mean: 3,7 years, range: 1 week to 9 years) is remarkably long in childhood cases.	0.8154739930866548
Pathogenetically an internal rectal prolapse with secondary ischemic lesions is assumed.	0.2763589791638094
There is no evidence of an association to inflammatory bowel disease.	0.733859586761367
The ulcers ars often resistant to different medical and surgical options.	0.46900067234546156
Discussion: Pediatricians should be aware of the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome in order to make an earlier diagnosis and to prevent unnecessary diagnostic procedures and concerns of patients and their parents about more severe illnesses.	0.6096654036153017
A typology of chronic illness in childhood and adolescence is developed.	0.4048171942752324
In a comparative analysis of 29 studies, maximal androgen deprivation (MAD) was not found to be superior to partial androgen deprivation.	0.6503995341395886
Thus, MAD cannot be regarded as the new gold standard.	0.5288751225205922
Most trials focus on quality of life which - given the palliative aim of the treatment - deserves special attention.	0.7649191699404295
This aspect has not yet been evaluated, however, in the largest multicenter study, Intergroup study 0105.	0.6042950219007694
In patients with advanced bone metastasis or severe pain, MAD treatment should be begun because of the flare phenomenon.	0.6528136973875673
The synergistic effects of LHRH agonists on the prostate are currently being investigated.	0.43631280836300423
Since no clear prognostic factors exist and reduction of serum-PSA levels under MAD does not delay progression, the patient must help to make the decision of whether or not MAD should be begun.	0.6425031303270159
A case of generalized maculopapular rash and local indurated plaques following s.c. injections of either low-molecular-weight heparin or conventional (high-molecular-weight) heparin to a 75-year-old woman is reported.	0.5528059779587268
This rare reaction is described and the literature to date is reviewed.	0.7971820085095216
Perioperative morbidity and mortality in noncardiac surgery are mainly due to cardiovascular complications.	0.47451007461831846
Therefore, perioperative risk assessment is crucial to avoid these adverse events.	0.6437399486763028
In patients above the age of 40 years, the ECG is a basic investigation, often providing hints for cardiovascular diseases.	0.7002951044555797
Stress testing and, in special cases, stress echocardiography or scintigraphy (the latter only in those patients, in which exercise is impossible) can detect significant coronary artery disease.	0.7958855959194195
The vascularization reduced the perioperative risk in particular in those patients with unstable angina or severe coronary artery disease.	0.7592624361851457
However, prophylactic revascularization the stable patient does not improve overall outcome, because the risk of the revascularizing procedure must be added to the risk of noncardiac surgery.	0.6511810435784695
Other diagnostic procedures like echocardiography, chest roentgenogram, routine scintigraphy, halter ECG or halter blood pressure measurement do not add information to the perioperative risk assessment, although these techniques might be very relevant in evaluating other coexisting diseases (heart failure; valve lesions, in particular aortic stenoses etc.)	0.6430738286222564
and can be useful to improve medical treatment preoperatively (e.g.	0.4866562259342699
normalization of blood pressure).	0.4961871800767213
A verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old woman who had been suffering from interstitial cystitis with Hunner's ulcer for 10 years.	0.5363399724609534
Up to now, only 7 cases of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder unassociated with bilharzial cystitis have been reported.	0.606276768810067
Although the development of a verrucous carcinoma as a complication of interstitial cystitis has not been reported so far, the authors regard the chronic irritation of the bladder to be the most important etiologic factor for the malignant transformation.	0.7884269376181714
After conservative management had failed, a radical cystectomy with supravesical urinary diversion was performed.	0.43395961531725424
The characteristics of interstitial cystitis, verrucous carcinoma and surgical management are discussed.	0.43705893110856564
Introduction: Abdominal actinomycosis is an uncommon disease.	0.5507612534044226
Nevertheless it should be considered in case of unclear tumor-like abdominal masses.	0.7170311061646186
Methods: We report a case of a 49-year-old patient with an intrauterine device.	0.8419535710317693
The patient was submitted with a solid and painful tumor in the upper abdomen.	0.7180202756898664
After sonography, computerized tomography, gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy the preoperative presumptive diagnosis was a carcinoma of the transvers colon invading the abdominal wall.	0.42500382528930003
Pathological examination after a right hemicolectomy surprisingly revealed an actinomycosis.	0.3355745302699049
Results: Based on this case diagnostic tools and therapeutic options of actinomycosis of the colon are discussed.	0.7226147180810818
Conclusions: This case illustrates the importance to consider the possibility of actinomycosis when finding an unclear abdominal mass.	0.5873042044572591
After a surgical excision an abdominal actinomycosis requires antibiotic therapy.	0.3203907644105554
Long-term treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenias requires integration of many therapeutic approaches, co-operation of several professions, and regard for the views of patients and relatives.	0.7281316234666119

Continuous neuroleptic treatment is indispensable in most cases to achieve social integration.	0.4777325926705362
Indications for adding on antidepressants, lithium, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines and other drugs are discussed, as well as treatment of negative symptoms, depression and management of treatment-resistant symptoms.	0.5058861716988977
Psychotherapy needs to regard the possibilities of the patient.	0.531371975471161
In the context of a stable long-term relationship, the patient is supported in experiencing himself as a subject capable of action.	0.7354130384642819
Effectiveness of cognitive treatments to date is limited.	0.37719922947945533
The best results are achieved by social skills training.	0.48172740664455593
Social therapy, which aims at the improvement of functional aspects of the patient, is of paramount importance.	0.8083839271663016
Improved possibilities for work rehabilitation are contrasted by difficulties in financing long-term social rehabilitation.	0.37094781842801483
Interventions based on the EE concept are highly effective, but are rarely used.	0.6756184018938124
Programs that merely convey information without targeting behaviour modification are ineffective.	0.1998030756805127
The functions of facilities of treatment in the community are explained, the integrative role of case-management is stressed.	0.680064259314058
The effect of a locally applied peppermint oil preparation on tension-type headache was examined in the design of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study for the first time.	0.5932720274187925
The preparation was tested against both the reference substance acetaminophen and to the corresponding placebo.	0.6226222712560991
The liquid test preparation contained 10 g of peppermint oil and ethanol (90 %) ad 100 (test preparation LI 170, Lichtwer Pharma, Berlin); the placebo was a 90 % ethanol solution to which traces of peppermint oil were added for blinding purposes.	0.5171384082219403
The reference preparation contained 500 mg acetaminophen; the placebo tablet was identical to the verum in size and appearance.	0.49591533384834374
The study included the analysis of 164 headache attacks of 41 patients of both sexes ranging between 18 and 65 years of age, suffering from tension-type headache in accordance with the IHS classification.	0.5778782303911381
Four headache episodes per patient were treated in a double-blind, randomized crossover design.	0.5435890046243403
Each headache attack was treated by the application of 2 capsules of the oral medication (1000 mg of acetaminophen or placebo) and the cutaneous application of the oil preparation (peppermint oil or placebo solution).	0.6799731404772088
The oil was spread largely across forehead and temples which was repeated after 15 and 30 minutes.	0.33592210881932233
Using a headache diary, the headache parameters were assessed after 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes.	0.664626497819029
Compared to the application of placebo, a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution significantly reduced the clinical headache intensity already after 15 minutes (p < 0.01).	0.5329839232245014
This significant clinical reduction of the pain intensity continued over the one hour observation period.	0.5215632275406403
Acetaminophen, too, proved to be efficient compared to placebo (p < 0.01).	0.5263412224468574
There was no significant difference between the efficacy of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution.	0.4683764017433858
Simultaneous application of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution leads to an additive effect which remains below the significance threshold, however.	0.5240151019446635
The patients reported no adverse events.	0.3676825557427449
This controlled study showed for the first time that a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution efficiently alleviates tension-type headache.	0.521582944934017
Peppermint oil thus proves to be a well-tolerated and cost-effective alternative to usual therapies.	0.6763732050002115
The positive results of several multi-center studies significantly improved the immunomodulatory treatment of multiple sclerosis over the last few years.	0.6352119779129027
It was demonstrated that different compounds are capable to reduce the number of relapses and to modulate the progression of disease.	0.5076826092883742
To improve the transition of results obtained in these studies into daily clinical practice, a consensus group started to prepare a report on the current treatment options for the German-speaking European countries.	0.7950423414048711
The aim of this paper is to summarize the current knowledge, compare the results of recent clinical trials with the experience from other  therapeutic options and assess their clinical evidence.	0.7636868384232526
Dislocated metacarpal V fractures, fixed by percutaneous Kirschner wires or other implants near the metacarpophalangeal joint, often show impaired movement despite excellent radiologic findings.	0.4190833590259654
We therefore chose an alternative method using intramedullary Kirschner wire osteosynthesis according to Foucher.	0.34238592563952525
Twenty-five patients were operated on in a 3-year period and movement of the fingers and complications were examined.	0.8094757242486961
Six weeks after operation all fractures were consolidated in anatomical reduction.	0.5338431968909746
One patient suffering from an early stage of Sudeck's dystrophy was healed, and no other complications appeared.	0.7419862499937123
Three months after treatment all patients achieved free movement of the fingers with anatomical alignment.	0.6795330036173134
We therefore recommend intramedullary Kirschner wire osteosynthesis in distal metacarpal V fractures.	0.4014699347179598
Aspiration of toxic substances, foreign material, bacterially contaminated secretions, or water (near-drowning) either immediately leads to cessation of respiration or to impaired ventilation due to airway obstruction, it causes hypoxia due to surfactant dysfunction, and pulmonary infection might develop.	0.5488154172289283
Respiratory insufficiency is the resulting consequence which needs immediate and appropriate therapy and intervention.	0.3589028421109822
The knowledge of risk factors that promote aspiration injury is important for its prevention and limitation.	0.5866438694126558
Mortality varies between 3 and 70% depending on patients studied, and on the nature and amount of aspirated material.	0.6605977295234278
The major cause of death is acute respiratory failure.	0.45878863434180495
The onset of injury to the lung after aspiration is very rapid.	0.5002645706269605
Therefore, therapeutic interventions like bronchoscopy are often too late.	0.4691737443956776
More importantly, oxygenation should be monitored continuously for timely institution of mechanical ventilation.	0.4379496089560452
Antibiotics should not be given routinely but a calculated regime is neccessary when signs of infection develop.	0.4856045333424787
Prognosis in near-drowning considerably depends on early rescue and successful resuscitation.	0.40130737715313974
A rapid onset of cerebral hypothermia during the accident can help to increase the ischemic tolerance of the brain and makes it neccessary to continue advanced life support until rewarming of the near-drowning victim.	0.5649466580529197
Anticipation of individual outcome in unconscious patients is difficult.	0.3585071404071828
One third of them survive with a moderate to severe neurologic damage.	0.4786023300061021
The overall mortality of near-drowning is about 11%.	0.4770937315102881
Pathophysiological aspects, diagnostic procedures, pratical management and possible prophylaxis of aspiration injuries will be discussed.	0.5047683569996153
Background: Semiquantitative classification of corneal topography after penetrating keratoplasty has the potential for focusing information about the areal dioptric power of the cornea.	0.6021663963103128
The purpose of this study was to objectify the procedure of manual semiquantitative classification using a Fourier transform of corneal topography power data and to correlate both methods.	0.5229864358513379
Recently, professional anaesthesiologists organizations, have set up recommendations for intraoperative monitoring.	0.547131721496635
These recommendations are based upon the assumption that anaesthesia-related deaths are largely preventable and that extensive monitoring will reduce mortality.	0.5257090340081472
Hypoxaemia appears to be an important pathophysiological mechanism, and this is why oxygen monitoring is given a high priority in safety standards in anaesthesia.	0.6926329839605477
However, no reduction in mortality has been definitively shown to follow the use of any monitoring device in randomized, controlled trials.	0.7215880118706453
Four techniques of oxygen monitoring are discussed and evaluated.	0.4499154457850838
Oxygen monitoring during inspiration can be recommended, although its implementation will probably prevent only a few anaesthesia-related deaths.	0.6583539121881818
Pulse oximetry is certainly highly recommended, but also has some deficiencies which are not sufficiently well known considering the popularity of this technique.	0.676514467966225
Transcutaneous PO2 is considered mainly for historical reasons.	0.22448917348636016
Near infrared spectrometry is a new technique offering noninvasive and continuous monitoring of intracerebral oxygenation.	0.5928299617719589
The increasing frequency of stent implantation into coronary arteries is based mainly on assumptions.	0.4638174370377909
One of these assumptions is that stents may prevent restenosis.	0.489838962821459
Stents can prevent restenosis as has been shown in two randomized studies (Stress I and Benestent I), but only in large (> 3.0mm) vessels with short denovo lesions.	0.7368675876461521
Despite the very tight selection of patients suitable for stent implantation in these two studies, the advantage for stents remained small (about 10% less restenosis) and appeared to decrease with time following intervention.	0.6554181294431028
There is increasing concern about the extension of stenting in an "unrestricted strategy".	0.4774743719998375
This concern was expressed in the ACC Expert Consensus Document which was published recently (JACC 28, No 3, September 1996: 782-794.	0.49022097078950116
Based on the lack of data for most of the presently used stent indications the expert group recommended a more selective strategy for the implantation of stents into coronary arteries.	0.5788154509535415
Removal of the arterial sheath immediately after PTCA is desirable for patients, reduces the medical staff's workload, and may decrease hospital costs due to a shortened length of stay.	0.7090475598301622
Although the safety and efficacy of the hemostatic systems used especially for the above purpose have been sufficiently documented, inadvertent intraluminal vascular occlusion is theoretically possible.	0.436826572146113
While partial or complete arterial occlusion in conjunction with the VasoSeal collagen prototype device has been previously reported, similar complications occurring with the Angio-SealTM device were not published.	0.46950335377717617
In this report, we describe a 54-year old female patient (height: 150 cm, weight: 42.5 kg) who was transferred for PTCA following an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.	0.6947280111828138
Immediately after PTCA, the Angio-SealTM device was deployed utilizing standard technique.	0.5184545993010587
No difficulties were encountered during device deployment, however, immediately following device placement active arterial bleeding occurred.	0.3420437824315059
Due to the inadequacy of hemostasis, heparin was reversed with protamine to avoid further hemorrhagic complications.	0.3888689583060091
Following this, the desired hemostasis quickly occurred, but the patient soon complained about symptoms suggestive of an acute occlusion of the right femoral artery.	0.8415776177854596
Unsatisfactory attempts as lysis resulted in the patient being transferred to vascular surgery.	0.505485968578516
The complete Angio-SealTM system (anchor including collagen) was located intravasculary, and removed during surgery.	0.586656265494266
Deviations in the axes can be physiological or pathological.	0.29903995076547457
During growth, the axes of the lower extremities undergo significant changes.	0.6841785900275991
The femoral neck-shaft-angle decreases from 150 ° on average at birth to 120 ° on average at the end of growth.	0.5506071957159555
The lower leg is bowed in a varus direction at birth.	0.4205468229599633
On the basis of an extensive literature search (DIMDI, MEDLINE - status at June 1992), the causes of contact urticaria so far known are displayed in tables.	0.566112097029875
The contact urticariogens can be divided into (1) chemically defined substances and (2) chemically undefined biological materials.	0.5355530097415818
The causes most frequently encountered in 16 professions are given.	0.4435344605773011
Numerous agents are known for medical professions (physicians, nurses, dentists and dental technicians, veterinary surgeons).	0.3801047477879714
Today, the most frequent single cause of contact urticaria is probably the presence of latex proteins in rubber (gloves, condoms, tubes, balloons, etc.).	0.569351225588896
When testing is performed a stepwise approach is recommended for safety reasons (rub test, prick test, scratch chamber test).	0.4759979559422421
For some contact urticariogens a commercial radioallergosorbent test (RAST) is available.	0.48377404764966214
In the cases reported in the literature it is not always possible to decide definitely whether the pathogenetic mechanism was immunologic (IgE mediated) or non-immunologic (toxic or pseudoallergic).	0.6316577814696642
When there is a high degree of sensitization (e.g.	0.5437718919324704
to latex) professional activities must be severely restricted, or even completely discontinued in rare cases.	0.4817143398551681
Purpose: To find and describe potential MRI criteria of nutrient vessel canals of carpal bones.	0.4260000661157794
2-Agonists are being used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine because of their antihypertensive, analgesic and sedative properties.	0.6520067004202038
Platelets bear 2-receptors on the cell surface.	0.33892945115378986
Stimulation of these receptors by agonists induces platelet aggregation.	0.4218396305364075
The present study examined whether in vitro incubation of blood with the 2-agonists clonidine and dexmedetomidine decreases 2-receptor density and hereby influences platelet aggregation.	0.5578423905841646
Prehospital diagnosis and first line therapy of acute chest pain are among the most frequently encountered challenges for general practitioners and emergency physicians.	0.7055815222334371
Acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes in general are present in about a third of patients complaining of acute chest pain.	0.6104214807073159
The basis of first line therapy is the understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia, the clinical symptoms, the diagnostic tools and the preclinically available therapeutic options.	0.9050110109364837
Time is the most critical factor in myocardial ischemia and subsequent infarction with irreversible injury of subendocardial cells starting within 30-60 minutes of total myocardial ischemia and with transmural infarction becoming complete in 3 to 6 hours.	0.6243963519422635
With 30% of patients dying within the first hour of ischemia mostly due to ventricular arrhyhtmias every effort needs to be made to shorten the delay between symptom onset and start of reperfusion therapy.	0.6870659414347233
The present overview concentrates on the armamentarium of preclincial diagnosis and the options of first line therapy of myocardial infarction with the aim of a short transport time to the hospital and therefore a short delay to more specific therapies like thrombolysis or PTCA.	0.6984478971742731
The aim of surgical intervention in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is the achievement of normocalcemia and euparathyreosis.	0.7698840599303782
Despite improved diagnostic procedures containing comparatively modified pre- and intraoperative methods to determine the position of the parathyroid glands and the most efficient operative technique including minimal-invasive surgery thereof, success cannot be guaranteed.	0.5811626548854855
Therefore, we should strive to avoid reintervention by ensuring a hemorrhage-free, atraumatic, anatomical-orientated operation and providing positive preconditions for reoperation.	0.5247560106036979
Success is based on the four pillars of the HPT surgery: history, embryology with anatomy, neck surgery and experience.	0.4536681716038075
By means of this principle and the results of surgical treatment in 1634 patients with pHPT from 1982 until 1998, we demonstrate a standardized operative technique of pHPT.	0.6747209548849967
A 67-year-old male patient presented with a nephrotic syndrome.	0.6074111770281921
Biopsy of the kidney revealed the characteristic of fibrillary glo-merulopathy on light and electron micros-copy.	0.41914485667641294
Other non-nephritic causes of a nephrotic syndrome (e.g.	0.3171712870419504
amyloidosis, immunotactoid glomerulopathy, light-chain glomerulopathy, cryoglobulinaemia, collagen-III glomerulopathy, fibronectin glomerulopathy) could be excluded.	0.49760406000465424
Besides the case report, differential diagnosis of fibrillary glomerulopathies is presented.	0.6038811285602194
Two patients were infected with sporotrichosis; one had the fixed cutaneous form, the other the lymphocutaneous form.	0.71237158204007
Sporotrichosis schenckii was identified in both with a culture from a tissue biopsy.	0.39078605064371036
Both patients were successfully treated with itraconazole, one received 100 mg and the other 200 mg itraconazole daily over a 3 months period.	0.6460083267862416
Abstract   Mitoxantrone is an anthracenedione antineoplastic agent that has recently been shown to be effective in ameliorating disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) as indicated by clinical and MRI data.	0.5526200125270885
However, the role of mitoxantrone in escalating treatment of patients with frequent and severe relapses and with rapid progression of disability is less clear.	0.5616385800993734
In this retrospective analysis we report on 15 patients with severe relapsing-remitting (9 patients) and secondary progressive MS with superimposed exacerbations (6 patients) treated openlabeled with mitoxantrone in our Clinical Research Group from July 1994 to October 1998.	0.8237775225751586
Eleven of these patients (73%) were treated with azathioprine, interferon-beta-1b or cyclophosphamide before.	0.7469942215196502
The patients received mitoxantrone over a period of at least 12 months (19 +/- 6 months) with a single dose of 10 mg/m2 monthly for the first three months.	0.9336331056116591
Thereafter, infusions were repeated every 3 months (total dose 141 mg +/- 45 mg).	0.5090305849642821
The annual relapse rate could be significantly reduced from 3,0 +/- 1,5 in the year before therapy to 0,5 +/- 0,5 during therapy.	0.7791805312835292
Nine patients (60%) were stabilised, while four patients (27%) showed an improvement of disability.	0.9532370399897245
The treatment was well tolerated with only minor side effects.	0.5268316926556773
These results although retrospectively obtained confirm previous trials showing that mitoxantrone may be useful in MS patients with frequent and severe exacerbations and/or a rapidly progressive course of the disease who have had other immunomodulatory medication.	0.5933181748372213
Interstitial cystitis (IC) represents a rare and complex inflammatory bladder condition in which diagnostics can be challenging.	0.47273281947623985
Strict NIH criteria for its diagnosis were designed for research purposes.	0.3729309837408667
Their routine application would miss large proportions of IC patients.	0.2615737260278129
When IC is suspected, history and physical exam are followed by an evaluation of long-term voiding diaries.	0.5624194437855803
Large voided volumes (functional capacity >250 cc) or longer micturition intervals (>2 h.), absence of nocturia or symptom-free periods reduce the likelihood of IC.	0.6422395236556291
Further exclusion diagnostics include urine tests (infection), cytology (in-situ carcinoma), ultrasound (calculi, bulks, anomalies) and urodynamics in selected cases.	0.5410626918564445
Bladder capacity measurements under sedoanalgesia are of limited value, since functional low-volume bladders can be mechanically extendable.	0.44388667688844485
Cystoscopy under general anesthesia represents the diagnostic standard procedure for IC during which 90% of IC-patients present with characteristic mucosal glomerulations after bladder distension.	0.5050674463510546
Biopsies are recommended for exclusion of malignancy.	0.45604929620927015
Potassium-leak testing plays no relevant role in routine diagnostics due to its poor sensitivity.	0.38152468675558626
Similarly, complex determinations of novel IC markers (histamine, tryptase, cytokines, growth factors, substance P, nitric oxide) are of no relevance in clinical settings and should be restricted to research projects.	0.5533388293650213
According to semiotics, which may be defined as the doctrine of the essential nature and fundamental varieties of signs, objects, and interpretants, pain is considered to be a sign (significant) with very different meanings (significance) either as a naturalistic symptom (of disease) or as a symbol used in a metaphorical context.	0.7361515451476626
When following this methodological perspective it is possible to interpret medical as well as poetic writings on equal terms.	0.41034933106921534
In Graeco-Roman medical texts pain was mostly understood as a result and an indicator of disease, but nonetheless as a symptom which seemed to be actively produced by the affected body.	0.6289752537333391
Especially in the Corpus Hippocraticum dating from the 5th and 4th century B. C. this materialistic and at the same time psychosomatic attitude can be noticed.	0.4931059332918107
Aristotle (4th century B. C.), Celsus (1st century A. D.), and the famous experimental physiologist Galen (2nd century A. D.) agreed that pain was a sign of evil which should be fought without exception.	0.5184156969027458
It was Galen who added the disturbance of function (functio laesa) as the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well-known cardinal signs of Celsus (rubor, calor, tumor, dolor).	0.5875610737212649
He also coined the term µK to characterize an attack of migraine.	0.2701899167742684
In algotherapy, Galen used a complex pharmacological system which was based upon the four cardinal qualities of humoral pathology.	0.42296791886719626
On the other hand, pain was designed as a multi-dimensional symbol by the famous Graeco-Roman epic poets.	0.4870848870784666
In Homer's Odyssey (8th century B. C.), pain appears transformed into the shape of a scar which is visible and palpable on the hero's leg like an identification tag, whereas in Virgil's Aeneids (1st century B. C.) pain symbolizes weakness and defencelessness which can only be alleviated by the goddess Venus.	0.47167030085984474
In this article current indications and limitations of neuromuscular monitoring are reviewed.	0.6259921379041451
Attention is mainly focused on detection of residual curarisation.	0.34923486492574873
New insights in the pathophysiological consequences of residual neuromuscular blockade and the actual criteria of complete recovery are discussed.	0.5190486124367992
Surprisingly in this context, despite the benefit of neuromuscular monitoring, its utilisation in clinical practice is rather an exception than the routine.	0.6714797235746601
A lack of standardisation of neuromuscular monitoring is probably the major problem on the way to a widespread utilisation of the monitoring.	0.6250847760636558
Three patients presented with an acquired green discoloration of their scalp hair.	0.49634785001429493
History revealed that all of them swam regularly in private swimming pools.	0.39174852811030714
Examination of the hair by atomic emission spectroscopy showed that the green discoloration was caused by an excessively high copper content of the hair.	0.6845041373442922
This exogeneous discoloration is characteristically related to the uptake of copper from private swimming pools.	0.3814944918881584
A 62-year-old female patient presented with bullous, intensely itching cutaneous lesions, which clinically and histopathologically resembled dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease).	0.49229534860243274
Therapy with DADPS was unsuccessful.	0.19205365203997493
Because of associated cervical lymph node enlargement and splenomegaly, a lymph node biopsy was taken.	0.5454888235999266
Histopathology of a lymph node and of the bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis: angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD)-type T-cell lymphoma.	0.7250470004070577
Intensely pruritic associated skin eruptions are typical for this peculiar kind of lymphoma.	0.3404093416778601
These skin lesions are due to inflammatory cells and not to neoplastic infiltrations.	0.47391159614590933
This case report is the first report of AILD with bullous skin lesions to appear in the literature.	0.6346377369122993
Background: The procedures for prophylaxis and treatment of keratopathy following facial palsy with lagophthalmos are unsatisfying from the functional point of view.	0.5266839552849426
The purpose of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of a 0.2-T MRI unit and a 1.0-T MRI unit in the evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament in patients with clinically suspected lesions of this ligament.	0.7781962298477598
Twenty four patients with clinically suspected lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament underwent MRI of the knee on both 0.2-T and 1.0-T MRI units.	0.832118076138236
Three independent observers evaluated the examinations for primary and secondary signs of a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament.	0.5698895273481434
Frequency of these signs was determined for both modalities, and observer agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic.	0.5935101402852343
Sixteen of 24 patients had signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament on the 1.0-T unit; the 0.2-T unit detected primary signs in 15/16 (93 %) patients and secondary signs in 7/12 (43 %) patients.	0.7428964039427964
In 8 patients the 1.0 T unit showed neither primary nor secondary signs for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament; in these patients the 0.2-T unit detected primary signs in 1/8 cases (12 %), and secondary signs in 3/8 cases (37 %).	0.7319185296492513
Observer agreement was very good for the 1.0-T unit and fair for the 0.2-T unit.	0.6248578811869745
There is no substantial difference between 1.0-T units and 0.2-T MRI units in the visualisation of primary signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament.	0.709140295934033
In the visualisation of secondary signs, 1.0-T units are superior to 0.2-T units, and there is a surprisingly high rate of false-positive results with the 0.2-T unit.	0.886341586406168
As to the reproducibility of the results, the 1.0-T unit is far superior to the 0.2-T unit.	0.8281237662863251
Purpose of our study was to develop a reliable model to define clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) being at low risk and at high risk for occult retroperitoneal metastases based on pathohistological and immunohistochemical parameters in order to stratify the therapeutic approach.	0.615077933335073
3-5 paraffin-embedded formalin fixed tissue blocks of 149 clinical stage I NSGCT were available from all patients and were analyzed for histopathological features associated with pathological stage: presence/absence of vascular invasion, presence/absence of tunical invasion, percentage of each histological cell type present in the primary tumor.	0.5892709452256452
Immunohistochemical expression of MIB-1, p53, bcl-2, cathepsin D and e-cadherin was evaluated using a semiquantitative scoring ystem.	0.43613142484660444
Statistical analysis was performed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.	0.5410232096633906
Percentage of embryonal carcinoma [%EC (p < 0.001)] and presence of vascular invasion [VI (p < 0.0001)] were the most significant independent risk factors associated with pathological stage II disease.	0.6336841636003475
Combination of %EC and VI allowed correct prediction of final pathological stage in 88 % of patients.	0.6250665385000989
Cut-off values including both variables identified correct pathological stage in 131/149 patients (88 %).	0.478758278294305
Less than 45 % EC and absence of VI correctly identified pathological stage I disease in 91.5 %; more than 80 % EC and presence of VI correctly predicted pathological stage II in 88 % of the patients.	0.6696473204022111
%EC and presence/absence of VI appear to be reliable prognosticators to identify both patients at high risk and at low risk for occult retroperitoneal disease.	0.5788593257710237
P53, bcl-2, MIB-1, cathepsin D and e-cadherin did not appear to be of prognostic value in clinical stage I NSGCT.	0.5417957862959693
In the framework of rheumatic illnesses, the lungs and pleura are often observed to be involved.	0.6592268025274869
Dependent on the basic illness in question, conditions of the bronchoalveolar system, vessels, lymphatic system, and pleura that have developed differently inter- and intraindividually can be diagnosed in toporegionally variable forms and combinations.	0.66208499771193
In the causal pathogenesis, the initial (auto-)immunological alteration of the alveolar septa plays a role.	0.7442867217000031
When the monocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts are activated, as a result of a chronic inflammatory process there is increasing reparative proliferation, which finally leads to the nonspecific end stage of irreversible interstitial fibrosis.	0.754368078915858
The incidence and manifestation forms of lung changes show certain differences dependent on the underyling illness (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic scleroderma, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, Sjögren syndrome, and mixed connective tissue disease).	0.549742201688141
In addition to vasculitis and granulomatosis of the lung, therapy-induced lung changes must also be considered in the differential diagnosis since almost all basic therapeutic agents can cause this type of lung condition.	0.6385719699238104
Good knowledge of the parameters from the viewpoint of possible therapeutic measures is indispensable, as is close cooperation between the treating physician and the pathologist.	0.622794470046998
Scintigraphic imaging identifies pathophysiological processes; in other words it assesses regional perfusion, permeability, leukocytic accumulation and bone turnover.	0.4409857296049175
These processes precede morphological changes and this accounts for the high sensitivity of nuclear medicine procedures as well as the low specificity for the differential diagnosis of different diseases with similar pathophysiological characteristics.	0.6495158334181348
This review (1) describes and evaluates the currently used scintigraphic procedures, (2) suggests their differential use in certain clinical settings in comparison with alternative radiological methods and (3) addresses new developments in diagnosis using nuclear medicine procedures.	0.577590163138509
In summary, we advise dynamic bone scanning as a primary scintigraphic investigation.	0.5607350220995745
A negative scan excludes osteomyelitis in most cases.	0.3371313841077789
The comparison is made with conventional radiology and clinical history.	0.3992232105983842
In cases with short clinical histories ( = granulocytic inflammation), leukocyte scintigraphy should be the next diagnostic step; in chronic processes (lymphomonocytic inflammation), gallium scintigraphy is advisable.	0.6412956264163628
Other scintigraphic methods might be of additional use in experienced hands.	0.4308250203692496
SPECT is useful for clarifying inconclusive planar scans of the head, spine and large joints.	0.5041407553243283
To assess the clinical effectiveness of glaucoma therapy with diode laser cyclophotocoagulation, 106 eyes (51 eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma, 22 eyes with secondary glaucoma, 10 eyes with narrow-angle glaucoma, 23 eyes with other glaucomas) of 87 patients were treated.	0.6396284625955339
Using a diode laser coupled with a fiberoptic probe, ending in a focusing tip, all eyes were treated with 24-30 spots over 360  ° and 2.8-3.6 J of energy, 1.5 mm posterior to the limbus.	0.7690526705692757
The intraocular pressure was obtained over a period of time until 8-24 months after operation.	0.6449656748953561
Additionally, morphological changes of the ciliary body were observed in 25 eyes by means of ultrasound biomicroscopy.	0.6133544969553852
Our objective was to determine the efficacy of ESWL treatment in children and the extent of auxiliary measures.	0.6805535974938294
In a retrospective analysis we investigated number of auxiliary measures and the stone-free rate in children after ESWL treatment.	0.5717309819178681
We report a 44-year-old female patient who underwent surgery because of a suspected primary tumor of the renal pelvis in imaging procedures.	0.8798824947472202
Histology revealed the diagnosis of mesoblastic nephroma.	0.4208758332235024
This tumor represents a special entity of nephroblastoma that rarely occurs in adults.	0.30897607088000356
There is no unanimous opinion on the biological behavior of mesoblastic nephroma because the tumor behaves differently.	0.48040875040346154
The question of whether nephrectomy is indicated if there are no malignant features is also open.	0.6540397473525633
The decision depends on the given case.	0.4074604353416045
Nephrectomy can only be avoided if the intraoperative situation allows the tumor to be removed with an adequate distance from healthy tissue.	0.5964488649692853
The safety margin is necessary because mesoblastic nephroma shows fingerlike spread into the surrounding tissue.	0.4233906548151305
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) is a non-invasive method of recording quantitative data from gas exchange and ventilation for the evaluation of oxidative metabolism at rest and during exercise.	0.6211356144647516
Determination of oxygen uptake (VO2) and carbon dioxide output (VCO2) describes the activity of anaerobic vs aerobic metabolism.	0.5304900597028006
An incremental exercise test measuring gas exchange, ventilation and lactate release was performed in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from mitochondrial disorders.	0.5535139712515599
At rest as well as during exercise patients with mitochondrial disorders differ from healthy subjects with regard to gas exchange and ventilation parameters.	0.5539343198379316
During exercise, the decreased oxygen utilization of skeletal muscle and early activation of anaerobic metabolism in these patients are mirrored by a reduced anaerobic threshold, reduced maximal oxygen uptake and reduced oxygen pulse.	0.6382952827545076
Our study shows that CPX is a sensitive and practical clinical screening method of investigating mitochondrial disorders.	0.4800364348260818
Monitoring of pH of the esophagus is a routine diagnostic procedure, whereas until now pH-monitoring of the hypopharynx has been used only for scientific research.	0.7219555499875991
In the present study a critical evaluation scale was used to record the results of 112 patients who underwent pH monitoring to determine possible reflux.	0.7749721963562036
Since high refluxes often remain unnoticed clinically, further study is required in certain cases.	0.5769232755010929
The extent of reflux in the esophagus may not represent pathological changes in the hypopharynx.	0.522342573636362
In such cases 24-h pH monitoring of the hypopharynx can be a useful diagnostic procedure and may also help detect the pathogenesis of "gastric laryngitis".	0.6938244309589049
The occurrence of plasmodial giant cells in the liver is probably a morphological reaction pattern with the most diverse causes.	0.5774848826389397
In babies and infants, these changes occur in particular in neonatal hepatitis and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct atresia.	0.53497275959779
Viral infections and/or autoimmune reactions are discussed etiologically in giant cell hepatitis in adults (adult giant cell hepatitis, AGCH), which is much rarer.	0.5984142730168678
In some of the cases, there were conspicuously high titers against paramyxoviruses.	0.8744084580818221
Giant cell hepatitis can occur in the course of HIV infection.	0.5923167487809783
These both indicate an infectious cause.	0.16355819720155051
However, the disease cannot be transmitted to chimpanzees.	0.7104271638357842
Apart from our case, only one further case is described in the literature in which a completed hepatitis A infection could be demonstrated serologically.	0.887351936264117
In addition, the titer of antinuclear antibodies was raised in our patient.	0.5677453048311045
This autoimmune phenomenon is probably of crucial pathogenetic significance in our patient, especially since a hepatitis A infection on its own does not afford an adequate etiological explanation for the form of chronic and active hepatitis with consecutive cirrhotic transformation observed here.	0.58662062699947
In patients with a significant elongation of the ACL we propose a new therapeutic regimen.	0.7714741209826134
After mobilisation of the tibial insertion of the ACL we pull the bone block with the attached ACL distally.	0.5236712524174816
Thus the ACL is easily tightened.	0.30437330116870226
In accordance with this method, we describe the treatment of a case of a strictly proximal rupture of the ACL: the tibial insertion is mobilised, the bone block with the attached ACL removed from the joint.	0.8967848318438628
Ex vivo sutures are placed into the ACL, the ligament is pulled back into the joint, and the shortening of the ligament caused by the sutures is compensated by slight proximal dislocation of the bone block.	0.7245829909773309
Purpose: One aspect of biocompatibility of IOLs can be tested using specular microscopy of the anterior and posterior surface of the lens in vivo.	0.514357047940811
Background: The paper focuses on the issues, how couples cope with SIDS and how this can be facilitated by subsequent children, self-help and professional support.	0.5774880532956785
Methods: In a retrospective study, 60 couples, members of a self-help organization, were studied at the average of 5 years (2-215 months) after their loss.	0.8792117131699374
Depression, anxiety, physical complaints and grief were assessed by standardized questionnaires.	0.5090833233924712
A community sample of equal size of men and women of the same age were used as controls.	0.565134209908625
Results: Average scores of depression and physical complaints were elevated compared to the community sample.	0.5277664931128074
Men and women coped differently with the loss: Bereft mothers were more depressed and ruminated more about cause and preventability of the death than fathers.	0.39885784234203453
They expressed their grief more openly and found it more helpful to speak about their loss.	0.27218807940495854
The presence of subsequent children was of prime importance for coping with the loss; an early subsequent pregnancy was fraught with increased anxiety.	0.5378397436053024
Conclusions: The self-help group serves an important function as a coping resource; the pediatrician plays a key role in the psychosocial care of the afflicted families.	0.6564892092600375
A 63-year-old women developed livedo reticularis during treatment with amantadine.	0.472806019685655
This reversible side effect of amantadine has been most often seen in women and is frequently associated with persistent ankle edema.	0.4661050106726128
We discuss the signs and symptoms, pathogenesis and treatment of amantadine-induced livedo reticularis.	0.6355804732885084
Despite the diagnostic criteria of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV, the term borderline has been used in a non-specific way for a long time.	0.8399733136831176
For our investigation we constructed a questionnaire, which contained the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for the borderline personality disorder (BPD), plus the criteria for the other personality disorders and for the schizotype disorder.	0.6754964749379183
The two additional criteria for the BPD used by the DSM-IV were added.	0.6559024574720034
800 psychiatrists and psychologists were asked to mark all criteria, which they thought were typical for the BPD.	0.5917867631167228
By using the operational diagnostic approach for ICD-10 and DSM-IV a disorder was diagnosed from each of the 162 received questionnaires based on the marked criteria.	0.6186213818319285
92,0% of the questionnaires contained marked criteria for the diagnosis of the BPD by ICD-10 and 96,3% by DSM-IV.	0.7389050525834256
In addition each questionnaire contained up to eight other diagnosis.	0.30469733166089974
This is a sign for the difficulty to separate the BPD from other personalitiy disorders or the schizotype  disorder by using operationalised criteria.	0.5189897759477956
Looking at the lack of specifity of the operational diagnostic systems for personality  disorders, e.g.	0.4227210766642622
for the BPD which has been discussed by many authors for years, modification of the diagnostic systems should be considered.	0.7306140788802982
Neurobiological research has implicated the dopamine and serotonin system in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behavior.	0.46483295676187836
The efficacy of antipsychotic drugs has been questioned.	0.3617215869991687
Opened and controlled investigations have shown risperidone is effective for reducing self-injurious behaviour in mentally retardation.	0.42069776689449995
We report about 3 mentally retarded patients which were given open-label riperidone for 12 weeks.They participated in a detailed assessment of behaviour symptoms at baseline and the repititive behaviour was weekly rated with the disability assessment schedule (DAS).	0.49694526376197795
Purpose: To test the capabilities of vacuum core biopsy (VCB) in the diagnosis of mammographically indeterminate lesions.	0.664512114415647
Materials and Methods: 120 patients (131 lesions) were examined using VCB with 14G or 11G vacuum core.	0.554950127391002
Radiologic information systems (RIS) and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) are becoming increasingly widespread.	0.6441560560660028
This leads to new demands on the integration of the individual, formerly independent information systems (RIS, modalities, PACS).	0.584196285001148
Possible ways of integrating individual systems are introduced.	0.2841252329036711
Besides the detailed description of different realizations of system communication, its role in the PACS at the university hospital in Freiburg is explained.	0.6088921397534647
The integration of different information systems still requires the use of proprietary interfaces.	0.4541141462900207
An appropriate integration generally has been realized in Freiburg.	0.28455462935921305
In the near future DICOM basic worklist management will standardize system integration and render an interdepartmental workflow concept possible.	0.2812789637334785
Even though an available communication standard exists, not all problems in the RIS-modality interface are solved.	0.47974115118121013
Different data models in the various RI systems and modalities demand certain degrees of freedom in the standard.	0.36210891477660373
Thus a satisfactory workflow cannot be guaranteed even when all involved systems conform with the standard.	0.41769581469343076
Background: Denecke developed 1957 a surgical strategy consisting of three or four operative steps for rehabilitation of patients with unilateral paralysis of IXth and Xth cranial nerve.	0.48467659353578096
These four steps are the following: myotomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle, resection of the paralyzed pharyngeal wall, medialization of the paralyzed vocal cord and fixation of the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall which can be facultative.	0.5945828848369323
Reconstruction of the navel after tumour excision with subsequent navel resection is of great aesthetic importance for the patient.	0.5754294089149155
Methods of navel reconstruction are found in the literature but do not provide an elegant solution to the problem.	0.6885041641931753
Our method permits reconstruction of the navel during wound closure, by creation of two opposing trapezoidal skin flaps at the excision margin in the midline of the body; the umbilical fossa is then restored by jointly anchoring these flaps to the linea alba.	0.5389437415550064
Reconstruction has been successfully carried out in this way after melanoma excision in 7 patients.	0.6308786351087673
Mammography is an established diagnostic procedure for breast cancer.	0.5122158092967943
Data concerning screening mammography are available from nine prospectively controlled trials, the largest series being presented from Sweden.	0.5317047733868856
Mammographic screening leads to a significant reduction of breast cancer of 30 % in women ages 50-59 years.	0.790462195162106
In younger women (40-49 years) the benefit accounts to only 20 % and has not proven to be statistically significant.	0.8760818881515039
Nevertheless, the major advantage of mammographic screening is detection of the non-palpable tumor <= 10 mm in size.	0.7111847935165371
The treatment of these small breast carcinomas leads to long-term survival rates of >= 90 %.	0.8368325946656164
Mammographic screening programs have been introduced in the USA, Canada, Iceland and Sweden for women in their 5th decade of life.	0.4217842540634116
Starting yearly lifelong mammography-screening at the age of 40, the theoretical cancer induction by radiation exposure does not exceed 0.1 %.	0.5388600739379851
Under highly qualified conditions, it should be possible to minimize false-positive and false-negative screening results.	0.671837413176549
In Germany, screening-mammography is only introduced in patients at high risk for breast cancer.	0.5711840512348624
Based on medical data, mammography must be a part of screening for women with an average risk - starting at the age of 40, although there are still open questions needing further clinical research.	0.6881637130769103
Upper lid closure in facial nerve paresis induced lagophthalmos is often improved by implantation of gold weights.	0.3367414165380433
However, the tolerability of gold implants has not always met expectations.	0.5012105027735705
We therefore investigated whether results could be improved by implantation of well-tolerated platinum implants.	0.5452417353364184
Methods to determine the mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures are valuable tools in wound healing research.	0.5073906024163508
So far standardized testing procedures have not been defined in the surgical literature, which reduces the comparability of results from different authors.	0.6877191538271643
Therefore we suggest a modified tensile testing procedure which follows German industrial standards (DIN 53 455).	0.35331937069623465
The experimental set-up includes an universal testing machine and special clamps.	0.3347729473280637
The dumbbell-shaped specimen consist of freshly prepared pig skin and the suture which is to be tested.	0.46859948415200375
Well-known mechanical properties of surgical sutures and wounds were used to approve the precision of the experimental set-up.	0.6218507734162779
Reproducible analysis of all tested sutures and wounds (n = 120) was possible.	0.6026360491209883
We recommend testing procedures adapted to industrial standards to obtain comparable results in determination of mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures.	0.43333145900057507
Abstract  An infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to a large variety of complications affecting almost every organ system.	0.5125238922354929
With the increasing numbers of HIV infections, some authors have reported an occasional association between an infection with HIV and arterial aneurysm.	0.6435508819846997
However, complications affecting the vascular system demanding surgical intervention are rare.	0.591441730837307
Partial nasal obstruction in preterm and term infants increases airway resistance.	0.2959208644652967
It may reduce ventilation and cause disturbances of respiratory regulation.	0.3829467125277123
Although this is well established, nasogastric tubes are commonly used, because orogastric tubes are difficult to secure.	0.6112084966165346
A new technique for fixing orogastric tubes was tested in a prospective study in 11 preterm and term infants over a 4 weeks period.	0.6446583407780396
There was no preterm dislocation of an oral tube in 7 patients.	0.5801989898828563
The orogastric tube had to be reinserted once before regular change in 3 patients and only 1 patiend aged 15 weeks presented with multiple dislocations of the tube.	0.5504179446203764
On the basis of a 3 days period for regular change of the orogastric tube the reliability of this new technique was 86,2% for all patients and 92,5% for patients below 8 weeks of age.	0.8112532428358186
Mesenchymal neoplasms of lipogenic differentiation are the most common soft-tissue neoplasms in adults.	0.5339722346863199
In recent years a number of "new" entities and variants have been described.	0.5789351701308931
Their recognition is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls and inappropriate therapy.	0.43542114824146516
Chondroid lipoma, myolipoma, and purely cutaneous spindle-cell/pleomorphic lipoma are biologically benign neoplasms which may mimic sarcomas morphologically.	0.44637108947021853
Despite high-grade morphology cutaneous liposarcomas carry a favorable clinical prognosis.	0.4323532380403176
Spindle cell liposarcoma is a rare variant of atypical lipomatous tumour (well-differentiated liposarcoma) and must be distinguished from dedifferentiated liposarcoma with metastatic potential and benign spindle cell lipoma.	0.5844171108218758
The advent of cytogenetic and molecular investigations of lipomatous neoplasms has contributed to a better understanding of the biology of these neoplasms and led to a modification of conventional classification schemes.	0.4701097669947927
The intracranial space is divided into two large compartments by the tentorium.	0.4928629087440116
The hydrostatic pressure of spinal fluid is responsible for buoyancy of the brain within these compartments.	0.5135645582005822
In patients with craniectomy this equilibrium is exposed to atmospheric pressure.	0.4008162750293378
We report on four cases of reversible herniation after either bilateral or unilateral decompressive craniectomy performed for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and failure of conservative ICP treatment.	0.5432860046277624
All four patients had survived a severe neurological disease (encephalitis, subdural haematoma, stroke) which required craniectomy to control raised ICP.	0.569264391405802
All were successfully weaned from the ventilator and awake and CT scans showed no space-occupying lesion anymore.	0.46987810734168994
The patients showed a typical "sunken pattern" at the trepanation site.	0.6688989681782441
All patients developed clinical signs of transtentorial herniation (i.e.	0.38666876972929326
unilateral dilated pupils, deteriorated alertness, and extensor posturing) shortly after either diagnostic or presumed therapeutic lumbar puncture.	0.41891364285165517
One patient developed herniation a second time while in the typical 30 ° upright position.	0.5159407761249346
After craniectomy, transtentorial herniation is possible even in the absence of increased ICP.	0.4228658866874295
It is related to a negative gradient between atmospheric and intracranial pressure, which is enhanced by changes in the CSF compartment following lumbar puncture.	0.6687339868473984
Lumbar puncture should be avoided if possible and, when necessary, only be performed in the head-down position.	1.0025646525678342
Acute therapy in these cases is quite simple; it requires flat or even head-down positioning and early cranioplasty.	0.5747450399212782
Diseases of the oral cavity, floor of the mouth, and nervous system can be accompanied by disturbances in tongue movement during swallowing.	0.5083406345538394
These disturbances can be diagnosed by videosonography whereby the examiner has to evaluate extensive video documentation of lingual motion.	0.4699936783380719
It was the aim of this study to facilitate this evaluation by the application of a reproducible computer-assisted quantitative analysis procedure.	0.706046413500829
Video sequences of 56 healthy adults and 19 patients with dysphagias of different etiologies were analysed.	0.5078734406836222
A numerical estimation of swallowing movements was carried out in abstraction from the structures imaged (bolus, air, muscles of the tongue, floor of the mouth, hyoid, etc.).	0.4785544675480644
Intensity changes of the pixels within previously defined radial image sectors were quantified in relationship to time and depicted as sector curves.	0.36743805162857257
The healthy adults demonstrated a characteristic pattern of two motion maxima that appeared within almost all sector curves.	0.3752372638489283
These maxima represented bolus transport movements and the reset movement of the tongue.	0.4052847087915977
Patients with diseases of the tongue or neuromuscular changes caused by disturbances of the central nervous system showed pathological deviations on videosonography.	0.5310517267170685
These appeared as local or general reductions in movement, slow speed motions, repetitive swallowing or unsorted additional movements of the tongue during swallowing.	0.4617823213110263
Clinically-used ketamine is a racemic mixture of two isomers, S-(+)- and R-(-)-ketamine.	0.7852383385870056
Previous investigations showed the anaesthetic potency of S-(+)-ketamine to be three times higher than that of R-(-)-ketamine.	0.7748504449437275
It was the aim of this study to compare the effects of S-(+)-ketamine and racemic ketamine on endocrine and cardiovascular parameters, recovery, and side effects in geriatric patients during total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) for orthopaedic surgery.	0.7216684530221927
Forty patients over 60 years of age scheduled for elective hip or knee replacement were investigated in a double-blind, randomised design.	0.5888775232093564
For induction of TIVA, patients received 0.1 mg midazolam, 0.5 mg atropine, 1 mg/kg S(+)-ketamine or 2 mg/kg racemic ketamine, respectively, 2 mg vecuronium, and 1.5 mg/kg suxamethonium.	0.9100858164028955
After intubation and relaxation with a total dose of 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium, a continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg per hour S-(+)- or 4 mg/kg per hour racemic ketamine was administered throughout surgery.	0.7518083877988148
Blood samples were taken through a central venous catheter at seven time-points, before induction as well during and after surgery, until the 1st postoperative morning for analysis of adrenaline, noradrenaline (by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection), anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol (by radioimmunoassay), glucose, and lactate.	0.5817898124667598
In addition, systolic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR), and arterial oxygen saturation were measured, and the time intervals between the end of ketamine infusion and the return of consciousness and orientation were protocolled.	0.6795330542271765
The incidence and assessment of dreams and other side effects were reported by the patients.	0.7113949726366531
Biometric data of the groups were comparable, the mean age of both groups being 68 years.	0.8338519198159172
Plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, ADH, ACTH, cortisol, and glucose as well as SAP and HR increased significantly (P<0.05) during the course of anaesthesia.	0.5543060060267018
The influence on lactate levels was not significant.	0.47153970686046076
There were no differences between S-(+)- and racemic ketamine with respect to these parameters.	0.7122920589305661
Three patients in the ketamine-racemate group showed severe arterial hypertension and were withdrawn from the study.	0.5616785850144309
Recovery clearly improved after administration of S-(+)-ketamine compared to the racemate.	0.6334267984304434
Simple orders were followed after 2.0 +/- 3.4 versus 4.9 +/- 6.8 min (P=0.07), orientation with respect to person returned after 5.7 +/- 4.0 versus 14.6 +/- 10.0 min (P<0.001) and spatial orientation after 8.2 +/- 5.4 versus 17.4 +/- 9.7 min (P<0.001).	0.7556283656233052
After racemic ketamine, 1 patient remembered a negative dream and 1 patient a positive dream.	0.6413241688099407
In the S-(+)-group, 1 positive dream was reported.	0.6029508399187323
No intraoperative awareness was reported, and all patients would accept the same anaesthesia again.	0.5640051184476718
Increases in cardiovascular parameters and insufficient reduction of the stress response with respect to ADH, ACTH, and cortisol seem to require a more potent hypnotic element during TIVA with ketamine.	0.5185824977628781
With regard to endocrine and cardiovascular parameters, the pharmacodynamic effects of racemic and S-(+)-ketamine were comparable.	0.6001523979070249
Because of the significant improvement in recovery and the reduced quantitative drug load, S-(+)-ketamine offers a clinical advantage compared with currently used racemic ketamine.	0.5967210547092735
The closure of large circular defects on the scalp is technically difficult and cosmetically often not satisfying, if a free transplant is necessary.	0.5340128490854851
Following the technique of Tillmann described first in 1908, several flaps shaped like a windmill can be combined.	0.4833007020837294
We report on 14 patients (ages 41-88 years) where large defects resulting from the excision of various tumors (5 melanomas, 5 basal cell carcinomas, 1 keratoacanthoma, 1 trichilemmal cyst, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 skin metastasis) were successfully closed by this method.	0.7846664213016205
The diameter of the defect ranged between 4 and 8 cm (mean 5,7 cm).	0.7346089070954552
Size and number of the rotating flaps (3 or 4) was varied according to the size of the defect and the mobility of the surrounding tissue.	0.8089318058582444
The procedure was performed with local anesthesia in all cases.	0.895120484060505
Wound healing occurred without complications except in 3 cases.	0.4579087945581315
2 patients (63 years, 70 years) developed small necrotic areas on the tips of the flaps.	0.5834963662293758
In a 74 year old man with a very large defect of 8 cm diameter, one flap of four underwent total necrosis.	0.6034832725131141
The cosmetic result was rated "very good" in 71,4% and "good" in 14,3%.	0.7475742086155593
The preservation of the terminal hair turned out to be of special advantage.	0.6447788696995447
The "windmill procedure" is an important addition to the surgical approaches for closure of large defects on the scalp, particularly in young patients.	0.8376577965215259
Intimal sarcoma of the pulmonary artery is an extremely rare type of malignant tumor of the large vessels.	0.7263000271774528
Despite systematic diagnostics, distinguishing between pulmonary emboli and tumors is difficult.	0.3547173442210041
We report a patient who was referred because of suspected embolic occlusion of the pulmonary artery.	0.8142139855087067
The operation was started with the intention of performing a pulmonary artery thromboendarterectomy; however, intraoperative histology revealed a malignant mesenchymal tumor.	0.5477487155566206
Therefore, the left lung was resected with the use of extracorporeal circulation, and the pulmonary trunk and right pulmonary artery were reconstructed.	0.8413703271498946
A solitary right lung metastasis was resected 3 months later using stapling devices.	0.3560312565528286
Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with sarcoma of the pulmonary arteries.	0.746931574612465
Surgical therapy often includes extensive reconstructive measures.	0.223655726569742
Since, thromboembolic obstruction cannot be excluded preoperatively, patients with this type of disease should be treated at centers experienced with the broad spectrum of pulmonary artery surgery.	0.682546560550563
Abstract  A rare cause of painful swelling of the knee cavity can be an aneurysm of the popliteal vein.	0.7567943496892887
Only 28 cases are reported in the literature.	0.4808657570097829
We treated a 20-year-old male patient who underwent three arthroscopies, one operation and one MRI; finally, phlebography detected a popliteal vein aneurysm and a malformation of the deep venous system of the popliteal and proximal calf veins.	0.6555974606584357
To avoid the threat of pulmonary embolism a resection of the aneurysm with interposition of a venous autograft was performed.	0.6655546750390695
Twelve months after the operation the patient is free of symptoms with a patent autograft.	0.9543480269121501
Hearing aids have fundamental disadvantages: (1) stigmatization of the patient; (2) the sound is often found to be unsatisfactory due to the limited frequency range and undesired distortion; (3) in many patients, the ear canal fitting device generally necessary leads to an occlusion effect; (4) acoustic feedback when amplification is high.	0.7335986051291026
Conventional hearing aids transmit sound into the ear canal via a small microphone.	0.43586353343007744
Sound has the disadvantage of requiring high output sound pressure levels for its transmission.	0.3651328806897968
This along with the necessary miniaturization of the loudspeaker as well as the resonances and reflections in the closed ear canal contribute to the disadvantages mentioned.	0.503188445661421
In contrast, implantable hearing aids do not make sound signals but micromechanical vibrations.	0.4040350263147644
An implantable hearing aid has an electromechanical transducer instead of the loudspeaker of a conventional hearing aid.	0.4944168041199836
The hearing signal does not leave the transducer as sound but as a mechanical vibration which is directly coupled to the auditory system bypassing the air.	0.3935846515794825
This implantable hearing aid is either coupled to the tympanic membrane, the ossicular chain, the perilymph of the inner ear, or the skull.	0.7715974004514983
Corneal cells are known to participate in the regulation of local inflammatory processes by secretion of cytokines.	0.4907137459767293
As the corneal endothelium may be exposed to endotoxin in organ culture and endotoxin is known to trigger inflammatory reactions, we investigated the effect of endotoxin from E. coli on organ cultured donor corneae with respect to autocrine and paracrine functions and the endothelial viability and density.	0.5301834956118913
For the majority of patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) many available hearing aids often do not achieve satisfactory results.	0.4767360324932951
For these patients partially implantable hearing devices have been developed, allowing distortion-free hearing and speech intelligibility that may be superior to conventional hearing aids.	0.6348691875682116
The external parts of partial implants, however, may result in a patient's stigmatization.	0.7597707451588555
Furthermore, they do not use the acoustic properties of the external auditory canal.	0.7213767663157524
Recently, we published the successful development of the first totally implantable hearing device for the treatment of SNHL (HNO 46 [1998] 853-863).	0.5969563048934525
Here we report the first implantations of this unique, totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients with SNHL: Implex TICA LZ 3001.	0.5596351652551997
The implant microphone is implanted subcutaneously in the outer ear canal near the ear drum.	0.3806998403614623
The signal is processed by a digitally programmable multichannel audioprocessor located subcutaneously on the bony skull behind the ear.	0.29585202951233824
A piezoelectric transducer is coupled to the body of the incus and drives the ossicular chain by vibratory actions.	0.4460031638439429
Energy is provided by an implantable battery.	0.4361534187426504
Implanted patients describe hearing as being distortion-free and transparent.	0.44075947398323584
Speech intelligibility and the hearing of music are improved.	0.30011809412176405
Patients may achieve better speech discrimination, especially in the presence of background noise.	0.5398433731420028
The aid can be used during sports, including swimming.	0.7865722392832183
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the implantation of a totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients.	0.6434924801768193
These results encourage further implantations of the totally implantable hearing system in the course of an ongoing clinical study.	0.5649367559105001
Catheter ablation by means of radiofrequency energy (RF) is an established method in the treatment of various forms of supraventricular and atrioventricular tachycardias.	0.6914852636892801
In patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), the success of catheter ablation depends on the pathophysiological mechanism of the arrhythmia and on the underlying heart disease.	0.7311769334216954
In the following report we give a definition of the terms nomenclature and classification.	0.6814684580709905
We find out, that the two terms are very similar.	0.699315275237763
They include the keys for diagnosis and therapy.	0.45423986380424036
We propose a method to construct new coding-systems.	0.3544575117963537
Furthermore we report about the existing coding-systems in Orthopaedics and Traumatology.	0.5470949845995695
We cite a list of national and international coding-systems.	0.2923562903935171
Because of the actuality we finally give a definition of the term "Indikationsspezifische Komplikation", which is of importance since the "5.	0.6572654212794443
Änderungsverordnung" of the "BPFLV-95" within the classification of the "Fallpauschalen".	0.6111007901153731
"Fallpauschalen" are a system like the American DRG's (Diagnosis related groups), but not exacly the same.	0.6820740825772188
Resection of a stenosing colon tumor in an 89-year-old male patient led to the diagnosis, unusual at this age, of an inflammatory pseudotumor (synonym: plasma cell granuloma) of the retroperitoneum and mesentery, which invaded the large bowel and showed infiltration of one regional lymph node.	0.6540312531336161
Histology and immunohistochemistry (demonstrating a myofibroblastic phenotype of the proliferating spindle cells and polyclonality of abundantly present plasma cells) of the specimen resembled previously reported lesions in various locations.	0.48629700504450796
The etiology and exact nosological classification of inflammatory pseudotumors are not yet unequivocally settled.	0.5167583618661351
The recently published conjecture that such lesions of the retroperitoneum represent a separate entity with features of a malignant neoplasm is discussed.	0.6251765248736568
An example of a plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumour (PFT) is presented for the first time in the German-language literature.	0.8492645635777659
The diagnostic criteria for this rare soft-tissue neoplasm of childhood and young adulthood, which is mostly subcutaneous in location and has a tendency to recur, include the plexiform structure which gives it its name, extensive siderin deposits and numerous osteoclast-like giant cells.	0.6179606820931992
The development of the tumour described here, which occurred in the field of radiation of a malignant haemangiopericytoma excised 7 years previously, indicates the possibility of induction of PFT by radiation.	0.7251752451477338
The current increase in the cost of health care must be considered as a severe threat to the prehospital emergency services system.	0.7242026572043577
Two examples have been selected - the patient with polytrauma and the patient in cardiac arrest - to demonstrate the dilemma between a need for objective data and the requirements of emergency patients.	0.9954685006107953
Study results obtained in trauma patients indicating that total prehospital time, including scene time, is correlated to patient outcome have led to the conclusion that at the scene treatment by emergency physicians may be dispensable.	0.7175039256703378
It has, however also been demonstrated that the time required for medical treatment at the scene is equivalent to 20% of the total scene time, thus representing only a fraction of the total prehospital time.	0.8433412004344909
Correlating the total prehospital time or scene time to outcome therefore appears absurd.	0.35371029105601354
The treatment principle of aggressive shock treatment in polytrauma needs critical reevaluation on the basis of results obtained by recent preclinical studies in patients with penetrating torso injuries.	0.5312593008385806
Small volume resuscitation could not be demonstrated to improve outcome in polytrauma patients, although a slight improvement in patients with brain injury may be assumed.	0.7218716201284189
Endotracheal intubation and early artificial ventilation are proven therapeutic principles in polytraumatized patients.	0.4097314078711239
Unfortunately, for ethical reasons randomised carefully controlled comparative studies can not be performed in polytrauma patients unless the patient is fully conscious.	0.7228278166362577
The importance of endotracheal intubation and artificial ventilation in unconscious trauma patients becomes apparent under conditions of anaesthesia where the application of the endotracheal tube averts regurgitation, aspiration and concomitant morbidity and mortality.	0.5443481404722847
The common causes of cardiovascular collapse and their pathomechanisms, as well as the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, have been widely investigated.	0.6365978742090641
Nevertheless, various aspects of their application are still controversial.	0.6556149832863857
The most recent study results have recommended initial ventilation prior to thoracic compression.	0.457973313218816
New methods of assisting mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation, such as ACD CPR or vest CPR, have shown promising results in animal experiments.	0.49921133473677154
However, the importance of results obtained by preclinical randomised controlled investigations in humans need to be confirmed by further studies as to outcome.	0.6537588069294185
The efficacy of defibrillation in cases of ventricular fibrillation has been clearly demonstrated, particularly with a view to the interval between ventricular fibrillation and defibrillation.	0.7299246411977125
It has further been demonstrated that basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation preserves ventricular fibrillation and thus improves the chance of survival.	0.4744234612788018
The present generation of defibrillators has been further improved, particularly by the introduction of biphasic defibrillator wave forms, which may reduce the required energy, as well as possible complications, while offering an increase in the efficacy of defibrillation and a reduction in defibrillator size.	0.7374648909788509
Scientific emergency medicine is responsible not only for the development and validation of new methods and concepts, but in particular for their application under quality control conditions.	0.7492594391669385
Politicians require an improvement in the quality of the validation of emergency measures, although the instruments available for the investigation of these measures are known to be obsolete (experimental models, experimental design).	0.6970488197898944
Additionally, the financial support of research in emergency medicine suffers from being accourded low priority by public research funds such as the German Research Fund.	0.5293314798710026
However, in view of the rapid application of experimental results to daily practice it should be emphasized that patients also support research in emergency medicine via their direct financial contributions to the health insurance companies.	0.5805614673151954
The prognosis in patients with gynecologic cancers depends not only on the stage but also on a wide spectrum of other findings.	0.546099029477158
Cross-sectional imaging modalities, including sonography, CT and MRI, have increasingly been used for optimal treatment planning in gynecologic cancers.	0.8005507351823723
Their staging criteria are based on the well-established FIGO staging system.	0.618247844141048
CT and MRI compete with sonography, which plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of the female pelvis.	0.6752169368818729
This paper reviews the role of sonography, CT and MRI in the staging of gynecologic malignancies.	0.6420642960307376
It puts the emphasis on MRI, which has been established as imaging modality of choice in the preoperative evaluation of cervical and endometrial cancer, and which seems slightly superior to CT in the staging of ovarian cancer.	0.7626371652970152
Extraabdominal desmoids represent one group of deep fibromatoses.	0.2801978279271938
These aggressive nonmetastasizing tumorlike lesions have a strong tendency to local infiltration, with a recurrence rate of about 40 %.	0.6415826515292697
Trauma, hormones and heredity have been implicated as etiologic factors.	0.37287412974728384
Shoulder, chest wall, back and thigh are favored sites.	0.44078706942944157
By combination of different diagnostic procedures the number of differential diagnoses can be reduced to only a few.	0.6802584632940996
While in former times surgery was thought to be the only kind of therapy, nowadays adjuvant procedures like radiation, hormonal therapy and also chemotherapy are becoming more and more important.	0.6270179757300994
Amputation or other mutilating procedures should be done only if the tumor recurs repeatedly.	0.570612106078017
Katayama syndrome is an allergic reaction of antigens of schistosomes, known as the acute phase of schistosomiasis.	0.5950338552949093
We report on an eleven year-old boy, who was seen at our outpatient department because of cough and oedema of the face after travelling to Malawi.	0.7163130356176073
Remarkable findings were an eosinophilia and antibodies against schistosoma-antigens.	0.3077667312829984
Six weeks later the diagnosis was confirmed by detecting eggs of Schistosoma haematobium in the urine.	0.5173370295142704
Parasitological examinations of urine and faeces four months later were negative.	0.3127010484208061
There is still a significant lack of treatment and rehabilitation facilities for chronic pain patients in Germany today.	0.8666080834501186
Most of all the treatment of low back pain and widespread pain syndromes or panalgesia is time consuming and complicated.	0.6835476159022629
The main problem of anaesthesiological pain clinics is the increase of these complex pain syndromes in the last years.	0.7034729138185609
The definition of chronic pain is a contiuous noxious input modulated and compounded by the prolonged or recurrent nature of chronic state and further complicated by a multitude of economic and psychosocial factors.	0.528870586838581
It is now clear that no one discipline or mode will suffice.	0.39867188185964664
Only a multidisciplinary and intensive approache will prevail, as discussed in this article.	0.6602006493035871
Unfortunately these multidisciplinary pain units are nearly not existing in Gemany just as little as control of the effectiveness of pain treatment.	0.4246824310786368
The use of somato-sensory evoked potentials (SEP) in supraaortal reconstructions has been well accepted.	0.5067386330333798
However, reports about incidence and clinical significance of ischaemic SEP alterations differ widely.	0.5268874718196379
In a prospective study we registered SEP alterations during 482 operations done on 419 patients between 1 July 1994, and 31 December 1996.	0.6512680409088616
Incidence, risk factors and clinical relevance were investigated.	0.6438812360012146
In only 1.7% of cases SEP examination was inadequate.	0.8075564057333622
During 406 operations SEP were altered minimally or not at all.	0.20425599087229138
Significant changes were dedected during 65 interventions (13.5%).	0.42384805374625784
The clinical outcome was poor when alteration was found during carotid dissection (five events, three deficits).	0.6045301633345243
Cross-clamping ischaemia was the common reason for alterations (81.5%); they were generally reversible after shunting and without clinical significance.	0.5817641972380334
As risk factor for cross-clamping ischaemia, only contralateral carotid occlusion was identified.	0.6105324766365464
Tyrosine-rich crystalloids in tumors of the salivary glands are rare and have been reported mainly in specimens from Black African patients.	0.6166075765936054
The pathogenesis of these structures is still unclear, but pathological secretion by neoplastic myoepithelial cells is supposed.	0.5849626713056117
Millon's staining and ultrastructural examinations are used for confirming the diagnosis.	0.38355268295732914
We present the case report of a 59-year-old woman with a myoepithelioma of the minor salivary glands in the smooth palate containing tyrosine-rich crystalloids as an example of this rare phenomenon.	0.6567844508574607
Pseudoarthrosis and cubitus valgus as main complications following displaced fractures of the radial condyle in children can be prevented by open reduction and fixation by K wires.	0.5505756053989406
However, delayed union and stimulation of the radial physis with condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow as well as fishtail deformities of the distal end of the humerus are reported nevertheless.	0.6952221082789815
To prevent those growth disturbances all primary and secondary (4-day X-ray control) displaced fractures of the radial condyle, i. e. those with a central gap of more than 2 mm, were prospectively treated by open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw beginning 1974.	0.7061855601525373
Sixty-six patients (41 boys, 25 girls) with an average follow-up of 10 years (2-22 years) sustained 28 primary and 6 secondary displaced fractures.	0.8715647466168596
In 5 cases a K wire fixation was performed in view of the smallness of the fragment.	0.6544399151344804
Two children with conservative treatment following overlooked displaced fractures showed condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow.	0.3948559713471007
Screw osteosynthesis led to symmetric elbow angles and function in all cases, whereas fishtail deformities could be observed in 8 of 27 children, probably as a consequence of the remaining central fracture instability.	0.7355401020093336
Conclusion: Open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw prevents condylar overgrowth in displaced fractures of the radial condyle by guaranteeing fracture healing in anatomic position within 3-4 weeks.	0.5217957781589384
However, fishtail deformity can not be prevented by metaphyseal compression only.	0.4546139379508237
A commercially available C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrate was used for short-term prophylaxis before surgery in two patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema.	0.6485736406444217
The patients suffered from recurrent subcutaneous and submucosal oedema of the face, extremities, and gastrointestinal tract as the result of a hereditary C1-INH deficiency.	0.610492447689463
Both patients were receiving tranexamic acid or danazol therapy as oral long-term prophylaxis.	0.4471706385871348
Over the years the patients underwent several operations in regional and general anaesthesia, with mask ventilation or intubation.	0.6134378430616676
The C1-INH plasma concentrations measured preoperatively were always very low (0.02-0.06 g/l, normal range 0.15-0.35 g/l), despite the oral long-term prophylaxis.	0.6479746661096618
Substitution treatment with 500-1000 U C1-INH was performed 1 h before surgery.	0.4507142826229864
No side effects were seen following the concentrate infusions.	0.536957462630598
With this substitution treatment no specific symptoms of hereditary angioneurotic oedema were recognized in either case.	0.3838371467608617
The measurement of C1-INH plasma concentration 2 h or 4 h after C1-INH substitution showed a marked rise in both patients, though normal values were not reached in either.	0.5831332506379954
We suggest that infusion of C1 concentrate is an appropriate form of preoperative substitution treatment in patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema, in view of the lower risk of infection than with infusion of fresh-frozen plasma and the observed effectiveness.	0.6483402269556752
This case report describes a 62 years old patient who suffered from therapy resisten atrial fibrillation for 12 years.	0.6674069451426904
She underwent "Cox/Maze-III-Procedure" during a mitral valve reconstruction and a stable sinus rhythm was achieved.	0.5466049381001853
Two years after operation she has been in a stable sinus rhythm.	0.5708446382125093
Transesophageal echocardiography revealed normal cardiac dimensions and function with coordinated atrioventricular contractility.	0.30511970719606574
Therefore the therapy with anticoagulants and antiarrhythmics could be discontinued.	0.4157897102760037
Two cases of congenital wandering spleen with typical clinical course are reported:  An 11-year old girl had a two month history of intermittent abdominal pain predominantly after physical stress.	0.6643165444741985
In upright position a palpable resistance could be identified as wandering spleen by ultrasound and scintiscan, and in this case splenopexy was performed.	0.740382683886007
An otherwise healthy 3-year old girl suffered from acute abdomen caused by torsion of an upside- down spleen with partial infarction.	0.5951041549778033
Diagnosis was made based on ultrasound and CT-Scan.	0.603421242645723
The extent of infarction could be evaluated by color flow sonography.	0.5780673439990341
After partial resection splenopexy in orthotopic position was performed.	0.2533235444156741
Discussion: In situations of intermittent abdominal pain as well as acute abdomen torsion of wandering spleen should be taken into consideration.	0.506224359703688
Monodisciplinary orthopaedic pain therapy no longer measures up to international standards.	0.30365452296174716
In cases of chronic back pain, in particular, there is such a gulf between the clinical findings and the patient's subjective assessment that the symptoms cannot be attributed solely to so-called degenerative changes.	0.788551397817661
Back pain patients are in great danger of becoming fixated on somatic symptoms due to an excess of diagnostic procedures or incorrect diagnoses, of being treated purely somatically on the basis of associated findings, and of suffering irreversible damage from invasive management of such findings.	0.6279460690336444
Despite the wealth of empirical evidence, it remains difficult to expand the everyday concept of illness and its causes to include not only physical and biological factors but also social and emotional disturbances.	0.562195201369147
Particularly physicians with a purely biological concept of pain have not learned to take note of affective relational factors and incorporate them into their diagnostic assessment.	0.37140019421818526
The decision to undertake invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures then frequently represents the doctor's reaction to feelings of irritation or helplessness.	0.4716328695738764
If this situation is to change, an interdisciplinary concept of pain must be made a part of medical training, and scientific findings must be presented in such a way that they can be integrated into routine daily practice.	0.6529089386074594
The laboratory surveillance of measles in Germany contributes to an objective estimation of the situation.	0.4733346813178028
Compared to data of the pre-vaccination era, the incidence of measles has been reduced, while a shift in age towards the group of 15-year-olds is observed.	0.7416650611441523
Germany will have considerable difficulties to reach the aim of eradicating measles in the European region by the year 2007.	0.5420792521052087
Apart from the fact that systematic surveillance is lacking, the immunity gaps in small children represent a particularly weak spot.	0.4695692563022848
In order to effectively control measles, high vaccination rates of at least 90% are necessary by the end of the second year of life.	0.7378478385817878
In addition, laboratory surveillance has to be included to measure successful vaccination.	0.6228870074523647
Main focusses are the laboratory confirmation of suspected measles cases, seroprevalence studies of population immunity as well as the control of the circulation of measles viruses.	0.5846079096158763
The Working Group Measles ("Arbeitsgemeinschaft Masern" - AGM) as well as the amended law on infection prevention are important instruments to make measurable progress towards measles eradication also in Germany.	0.6164838960024002
We report on the activities of the National Reference Centre for Measles, Mumps and Rubella since 1991.	0.617371880169667
The German data are compared to those of selected other European countries.	0.55048203615764
The different methods that are available for the assessment and quantification of "brittle nails" and for the evaluation of various therapeutical approaches are compared.	0.9183162323483613
At this time, measurement of the swelling properties is the best documented and most reliable method for studying the treatment of brittle nails.	0.6214068728105548
Reliable qualitative data can also be obtained by scanning electron microscopy.	0.5018693078918284
Measurement of the transonychial water loss and assessment of thickness and density of nails by ultrasound have also been used successfully, but the methodology still has to be improved and the reproducibility, confirmed.	0.6789747641867429
The case of a closed elbow dislocation with complete rupture of the brachial artery and its veins is described.	0.6314432757409536
This combination of injuries is rather rare and only 25 cases were found in the literature.	0.6122623308173285
The sharp lesion of the vessels was remarkable, probably due to the edge of the distally ruptured capsule.	0.5293671246576268
Immediate revision with suture of the vessels and an immobilization for three weeks gave a good result.	0.462993081170348
The management of multiple trauma patients has improved recently.	0.47684592290340494
Surgeons' education, preclinical rescue structures, initial clinical survey and therapeutic strategies, as well as diagnostic imaging, have progressed.	0.6174966465846747
Plain film imaging is increasingly being abandoned in favor of CT. Fast imaging techniques (spiral CT) have led to the inclusion of CT in the primary survey.	0.6994125500333569
To minimize the risk to the patient during prolonged diagnostic time, algorithms have to be defined concerning structures, emergency room equipment and quality.	0.6883493419660633
Basics, state of the art and suggestions concerning management of multiple trauma patients are presented and discussed from the radiologist's point of view.	0.5788317608986474
The importance of hepatitis C virus infection has been recently noted in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy.	0.5326257670576552
In a collaborative research project of the Committees for the Study of Idiopathic Cardiomyopathy, hepatitis C virus antibody was found in 74 of 697 patients (10.65) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in 42 of 663 patients (6.3%) with dilated cardiomyopathy; these prevalences were significantly higher than that found in volunteer blood donors in Japan.	0.7449909697829922
Hepatitis C virus antibody was detected in 650 of 11,967 patients (5.4%) seeking care in 5 academic hospitals.	0.6277877167105854
Various cardiac abnormalities were found, and arrhythmias were the most frequent.	0.6744981754969885
These observations suggest that hepatitis C virus infection is an important cause of a variety of otherwise unexplained heart diseases.	0.5835026291131375
Transdifferentiated retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) display enhanced contractile potentials and have been implicated in the development of tractional retinal detachment.	0.4855970126195911
This study determines the activity of contraction-promoting factors, examines some involved mechanisms and evaluates inhibitors.	0.36883576581890787
Using an in vitro contractionassay, we demonstrated that collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated RPE cells is effectively stimulated by serum, platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1.	0.6003724539844356
Endothelin-1 and transforming growth factor-1 and -2 have a more discrete or marginal effect.	0.900804937977559
Tractional forces promoted by these peptides are completely protein synthesis dependent.	0.27196188219199896
Contraction stimulated by serum is only partly dependent on de novo protein synthesis, suggesting different active factors and/or pathways.	0.4619622015998049
Staurosporine, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor, effectively inhibited collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated RPE cells regardless of the promoter.	0.4422824988518641
Revascularization in cases of recurrent occlusions following aorto-iliac vascular reconstructions, particular in high-risk patients, poses a therapeutic dilemma.	0.5061292892664666
We report the case of a 78-year-old female patient who presented - after multiple vascular reconstructions of iliac and femoral arteries - with Leriche syndrome, resulting critical limb ischemia and concomitant coronary and lung disease.	0.6679147995516681
Due to the high surgical and anesthetic risk we implanted an axillo-bifemoral PTFE graft.	0.5173610799671969
The preoperative angiography of the supraaortic branches revealed a high-grade stenosis of the right subclavian artery in the presence of a previously implanted carotid-subclavian bypass on the left.	0.7102892542057325
This stenosis was dilated and then stented by way of the proximal end of the axillo-bifemoral graft, which in turn was distally anastomosed to the right popliteal and left deep femoral artery.	0.589419105054085
Postoperative angiography verified a good run-off and satisfactory vascular status was obtained.	0.3893001160082331
Duplex sonography 6 months after surgery showed a good flow and the patient was free of symptoms.	0.8740008863331413
These results demonstrate that, combined with intraoperative stent application, an axillo-bifemoral graft can be implanted with good results.	0.6534404623761497
Objective: Concerning the long-term somatic development of children born with very low birth weight and/or born very premature, there are varying and sometimes contradictory statements.	0.5279958952505887
A follow-up study was carried out on premature-born children from Thuringia and Saxonia at pre-school and early school age in order to investigate the long-term somatic development of these children.	0.5528101897254655
Anthropological parameters were examined and compared with the data of a reference group.	0.8178367284753695
Mediastinitis caused by infection with Clostridium perfringens and spontaneous rupture of the esophagus are both life threatening conditions.	0.5040333543410006
The combination of these two entities led to septic multiorgan failure in a 38-year-old woman.	0.5866733614443803
The patient was treated successfully by esophagectomy and postoperative lavage through a partially open abdomen.	0.6108576958707728
The lack of information regarding emesis, the leading symptom of Boerhaave's syndrome, caused delayed diagnosis: the triad of emesis, severe epigastric pain and emphysema of the skin was not established until 30 h after the onset of symptoms.	0.6914385115576525
For ethical and socio-economical reasons (cost-explosion in transfusion-medicine, patient's individual destiny), devepolment and consistent application of allogeneic transfusion sparing techniques in surgery is a chal- lenge to anesthesiologists, surgeons and blood-bankers.	0.4893563707054188
The combination of different techniques, i.e.	0.4238899059971761
autologous predonation, hemodilution, choice of anesthetic regimen, deliberate hypotension, application of anti-fibrinolytic agents and autotransfusion of intraoperatively saved blood allow for avoidance of allogeneic blood transfusion even in patients presenting important intraoperative hemorrhage.	0.4569273602300394
Introduction: If the surgeon cannot find the tendon of the superior oblique muscle in the right place, he has to change his operative plans intraoperatively.	0.6260010191836896
Different procedures are recommended: reinsertion of the superior oblique in the right place, recession of the inferior oblique muscle, and operations on the vertical muscles of the same or the yoke eye.	0.6626138969618512
No quantitative recommendations on the surgical amount are mentioned in the literature.	0.37268669990605996
In 180 children (87 children belonging to a control group, 68 with fever of non-renal origin, and 25 with pyelonephritis) albumin and immunoglobulin G (markers for glomerular dysfunction), -1-microglobulin and  -NAG (markers for proximal tubular dysfunction) and apolipoprotein A1 (marker of 'postrenal' dysfunction) were measured in second-voided morning urine.	0.6757917124991838
In children with fever of non-renal origin, glomerular dysfunction was encountered in 8.8 %, tubular dysfunction in 17.6 % and mixed glomerular-tubular dysfunction in 14.7 % of cases.	0.7498831584440682
Among children with pyelonephritis, 28 % revealed glomerular dysfunction and 44 % mixed glomerular-tubular dysfunction.	0.5854719658429964
No case of solitary proximal tubular dysfunction was observed in children with pyelonephritis.	0.8300810687412042
There were highly significant differences in presence and expression of glomerular dysfunction between children with fever of non-renal origin and children with pyelonephritis (P < 0.0001), whereas with regard to proximal tubular dysfunction, the differences were only moderately significant ( -NAG: P < 0.01) or of low significance (-1-microglobulin: P < 0.05).	0.7049962217907462
This may indicate that morphologic changes occur during interstitial pyelonephritis due to inflammation of glomeruli, resulting in glomerular dysfunction, while proximal tubular dysfunction may additionally be due to fever-associated function processes.	0.4794725126524366
Up to the middle of the 1970s, chemotherapy had only a marginal role in the overall treatment concept for cervical carcinoma, and surgery and radiotherapy are still the cornerstones of treatment today.	0.7360778478863516
There are indications for chemotherapy, which can theoretically be used as follows:	0.8777881499901111
We compared a cw carbon dioxide flash-scanning laser system to an Er:YAG laser in laser skin resurfacing of facial rhytides.	0.3982574066753339
In all patients, CO2 laser treatment showed a better cosmetic result whereas erythema and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation were less marked in Er:YAG laser therapy.	0.44796164254546206
A separation of the individual latex layers is a known complication of endotracheal armoured tubes manufactured by immersion technique.	0.4915835458716578
This can result in herniation into the lumen with obstruction of the tube.	0.4835578810048205
Diffusion of nitrous oxide into the inner hernia considerably intensifies the obstruction.	0.2729813229843992
This can lead to life-threatening situations.	0.6146878108754056
We observed a similar herniation caused by layer separation with subsequent tube obstruction of silicolatex anaesthesia tubes used in paediatric circuit systems.	0.3949086234510245
This is caused by manufacturing defects and above all by damage incurred in reprocessing.	0.3550741991587912
Therefore it is important to process the tubes carefully.	0.476987189428635
A too-high drying temperature can cause premature layer separation.	0.26803643075024675
The tubes should never be processed more than 80 times.	0.4007673099169285
Routine examination of the tubes is imperative, especially at the predilection sites for layer separation.	0.5857495887686899
Severe aortic valve disease is a rare complication of coarctation in adults.	0.8995751680589138
Between 1961 and 1990 aortic valve replacement was performed after or combined with the operation of coarctation in 24 adults (4% of entire population operated for coarctation).	0.6963712062735471
Bicuspid aortic valves were present in 2/3 of patients.	0.5320186387565343
In 10 patients (710 with aortic stenosis) coarctation was operated early (mean age 24 years) and aortic valve late (mean age 40 years): in 14 (1014 with aortic regurgitation, mean age 40 years) aortic valve and coarctation were operated simultaneously (8 patients) or staged within 6 months (6 patients).	0.8167826324955552
Additional surgical interventions on the dilated aorta ascendens were performed in 8, mitral valve replacement in 2 and aorto-coronary bypass in 1 patients.	0.5155555583023306
Early mortality was 224 (8%) and was similar in simultaneously (18) and staged (114) operated cases: 10 year survival was lower than in an age-matched group of 72 patients with aortic valve disease of similar severity operated during the same period (70% vs 88%, p < 0.01): 67 late deaths were cardia; 55 pts with preoperatively severely increased end-diastolic (> 199 mlm2) and 44 with end-systolic (> 90 mlm2) left ventricular volumes and 22 with ejection fraction < 41 % died late postoperatively.	0.7516235217110232

42% had had at least one traumatic life experience and the women had higher percentages than men.	0.6573913079537965
The victimization primarely took place during childhood and prior to the begin of drug consumption.	0.41813024266106674
26% of the trauma victims were diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress disorder.	0.7142009011056576
In comparison with individuals without trauma experiences, victims evidenced significantly more comorbid symptoms, they more frequently suffered from polytoxicomania and had more experiences with psychotherapy.	0.5327030506024214
Nearly all drugs currently used during the course of general anaesthesia may lead to hypersensitivity reactions of various types.	0.548902917228698
There may be an acute type I allergic reactions or to a more or less severe pseudoallergic reactions, in rare cases with lethal outcome.	0.6583754499778556
Routine preoperative testing appears of little predictive value, in spite of the high frequency of so-called risk factors (atopy, other kind of allergy) among the evaluated group of patients.	0.6177226933201884
Careful allergological testing should be performed 4 to 6 weeks after any incidents of suspected drug intolerance, in order to discover the underlying causative agent.	0.5849348073953273
Skin testing is of diagnostic value for neuromuscular blockers and intravenous narcotics.	0.4630204803203025
RAST- and RIA-tests and/or mediator releasing tests may also used additionally.	0.49643695841274965
Together with all other administered drugs, all the routinely used neuromuscular blockers (suxamethonium, vecuronium, pancuronium, alcuronium, atracurium, mivacurium) should be tested, since they often represent the cause for such reactions.	0.5755505398230772
For other classes of drugs (for example, volatile anesthetics and opioids) the clinical relevance of skin testing still remains uncertain.	0.6787597285590374
For less severe incidents seen during general anaesthesia such as pruritus, or exanthems, skin testing seems to be less relevant.	0.5812261668891738
Nociception is a protective system of the body which prevents it from injury and tissue damage.	0.5563909354665388
Human beings respond to noxious stimuli by moving away.	0.28050968177794255
They learn by pain to avoid these situations in future.	0.40592887667994104
Shortly after major injury, there is a limited analgesic period allowing the body to flee the area of danger, later on, emerging pain compels the body to rest and supports recuperation.	0.5362391494758597
While acute pain has a certain meaning, chronic pain does not.	0.5848359105897989
It induces a comprehensive suffering including loss of initiative, appetite and vigilance.	0.3208568342155527
It reduces life-quality, often accompanied by depressive moods.	0.5493147178060145
Acute pain causes changes in the central nervous system leading to an increased sensitivity of nociception (hyperalgesia).	0.5270737913040183
During healing, the central processing of noxious stimuli is normalised taking minutes to weeks.	0.5090108781795097
Sometimes, unknown factors initiate chronification of pain.	0.20629673998349948
Changes on a molecular level in peripheral tissue as well as in the central nervous system induce "cellular early genes" [24], a synthesis of c-fos, c-jun and other proteins favouring the chronification of pain.	0.6533368276278537
All efforts have to be made to depress or interrupt such a development.	0.5220935368343939
One of the first steps to pain prophylaxis in a hospital is an optimal surgical technique: incision, extension, limited tissue damage and minimal invasive surgery should guarantee the smallest impairment of the nociceptive system possible.	0.6811555821768854
However, nociceptive input is intense and of long duration and leads to central sensibilisation.	0.4043572496281315
Postoperative pain has lost its function as surgery anticipates healing.	0.37742355480717626
Pain induces a reduction of ventilation, circulation, digestion and increases the risk of other disorders.	0.5132907873635719
There is need of aggressive pain treatment for humanitarian reasons and for reasons of late sequelae like permanent pain and increased reduction of function [10].	0.46921125606551656
This is of pivotal importance in patients with amputations or sympathetic reflex dystrophy (SRD).	0.41892036917608694
Antinociception is best provided by regional anaesthesia technique with a combination of local anaesthetics and opioids which results in better outcome [2, 12].	0.5744040891374668
Hence, regional anaesthesia techniques are strongly indicated in those patients.	0.5760054460605668
Good antinociception may be even more important than it is assumed today.	0.44540265750388447

In diagnostics of erectile dysfunction there are different simple or large-scale procedures available.	0.45651527949575843
Refering to a three-step-scheme that makes difference in the diagnostics in I. non-invasive, II.	0.7038909627576696
invasive procedures the current diagnostic measures will be explained.	0.4112842591203072
To the non-invasive measures do account the extensive patients history taking including the sexual history and the psychological diagnostics, the physical examination and laboratory screenings.	0.6339772927595159
The semi-invasive procedures include the intracavernous injection test with vasoactice substances, the doppler sonography and duplex or color duplex sonography, the corpus-cavernosum-electromyogram (CC-EMG) and other neurophysiological examinations.	0.6183316810947724
The third invasive step contains the dynamic infusion pharmacological cavernosography and cavernosometry (DICC) and the selective pharmacological phallo-arteriography.	0.4893460182180223
The procedures of this step are essentially limited to patients with erectile dysfunction who are planned for surgical interventions.	0.46352649067477564
Technological advances in the last two years in mammalian nuclear transfer techniques and the establishment of human embryonic stem cell lines formed the background of the International Workshop on "Embryonic Stem Cells and Nuclear Transfer Strategies" organized at the Gene Center, Munich, September 1999.	0.6082158063936459
The aim of the meeting was to bring together scientists working in the stem cell field and those working on somatic nuclear transfer techniques to discuss the present status and prospects of both technologies for basic and applied research and future use in medicine and livestock breeding.	0.5459551450984049
"Biology of Embryonic Stem Cells", "Nuclear Transfer Strategies", and "Stem Cell Differentiation - Cell Therapy" were the main topics of the meeting.	0.7758503725293474
It became clear that we are far from understanding the processes involved in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation and the mechanisms resulting in reprogramming of nuclei from somatic cells after transfer into enucleated oocytes.	0.42356545207307333
However, data were presented that showed the enormous potential of the embryonic stem cell technology for tissue transplantation in the future.	0.6205497950020766
Before any use of this technology in combination with any cloning technology for human cell therapy will be possible, further research including animal models and stem cell differentiation approaches in culture (i. e., identification of differentiation factors, selective differentiation strategies, reporter gene assays) is necessary to understand the basic principles of pluripotent stem cell differentiation and the mechanisms involved in reprogramming somatic cell nuclei.	0.6284404254351972
Certain fractures and/or dislocations of the femoral head are known to cause arterial injury and result in post-traumatic osteonecrosis.	0.6820928018031633
However, the more complex etiology of non-traumatic osteonecrosis is multifactorial and includes chemotherapy, radiotherapy, thermal injuries, and especially coagulopathies, which are now commonly observed in these patients.	0.8027746116363325
Intravascular coagulation with fibrin thrombosis begins in the capillaries and sinusoids of the intraosseous microcirculation, and residual venous thrombosis is more likely to occur if there is coexistent hypofibrinolysis.	0.5426281603814282
The aim of our study was to investigate the influence that serum of patients with preeclampsia has on t-PA and PAI-1 expression from human endothelial cells.	0.6009229602913474
For this purpose, we cultured human endothelium cells, gained from umbilical veins, for 24 h with sera of 7 patients with HELLP syndrome and 12 patients with preeclampsia.	0.7244244103097645
The sera of 12 normotensive pregnant patients and 9 non-pregnant women were used as controls.	0.46134679455970434
We then determined t-PA and PAI-1 levels by ELISA, both in the maternal serum and in the supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures.	0.5911556968227959
While t-PA levels were significantly higher in the serum of patients with preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome than in the control group (median: 8.0 ng/ml and 6.2 ng/ml vs 3.9 ng/ml and 3.1 ng/ml), levels of PAI-1 did not show any significant disparity among the different groups.	0.7879006826748293
The supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures demonstrated significantly elevated levels of both t-PA (P<0.001) and PAI-1 (P<0.01) when stimulated with serum gained from patients with preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome.	0.5731362249928271
The increased expression of t-PA and PAI-1 from human endothelium cells after stimulation with the serum of preeclamptic patients must be considered as a sign of increased endothelial cell activation.	0.5730651132804911
Postoperative pain relief can be achieved by several methods, including the use of systemic opioids and regional anaesthesia with intrathecal or epidural opioids or local anaesthetics.	0.6682237471601009
On-demand analgesia using a PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) system is regarded as the ideal option for systemic opioid analgesia.	0.5664693859286578
While PCA devices are not yet commonly used in all recovery units, the use of repetitive boluses on demand is still the most frequent form of administration in postoperative pain therapy.	0.7020938264058797
The objective of the present study was to show if continuous infusion of the opioid tramadol could produce better analgesia than repetitive administration of boluses.	0.6232564661144122
In a study under double-blind conditions 135 ASA I and II patients were assigned at random to group I (infusion group) or group B (bolus group) when they first requested pain treatment after abdominal surgery.	0.6552393336715635
The patients in group I received an initial intravenous loading dose of 100 mg tramadol, followed by an infusion of 12 mg/h tramadol for 24 h; if necessary, repeated boluses of 50 mg tramadol were given.	0.6483123842156503
In group B the patients received a placebo infusion instead of the tramadol infusion; otherwise, the procedure was the same.	0.8481394023033317
Pain relief was monitored by means of a VAS (visual analogue scale) up to 6 h after surgery.	0.6583663045259549
We investigated the retrograde assessment of analgesia by the patients after 6 h, how often repetitive boluses were required, and the amount of analgesics administered in 6 and 24 h. Results.	0.723847153187072
The pain relief was assessed as excellent or good by 76.5% of group I and 65.6% of group B; 19.1% of group I and 26.9% of group B assessed the analgesic effect as satisfactory; 4.4% of group I and 7.5% of group B complained of insufficient analgesia.	0.8888469003895515
In group I 69.2% requested only one or no repetitive bolus, compared with 40.3% in group B, while two or more boluses were demanded by 30.8% in group I and 59.7% in group B.	0.853781449365276
The average analgesic consumption after 6 h was 223.5 +/- 53.7 mg tramadol in group I and 176.6 +/- 63.1 mg tramadol in group B, respectively.	0.6079723059151279
After 24 h it was 449.5 +/- 66.0 mg tramadol in group I and 201.6 +/- 83.9 mg tramadol in group B.	0.5455335339792424
While the consumption during the first 6 h was comparable, from then on the consumption in group I increased significantly.	0.7341920467792573
Side effects were reported by 25% in both groups.	0.8772531984874622
They were clinically irrelevant and did not necessitate termination of the clinical trial in any case.	0.5808353631497631
During the study period pulse and blood pressure remained within the normal range and did not show any significant changes.	0.7080547522377996
The fact that the patients in group I requested far fewer repetitive boluses than those in group B and the assessment by the patients led to the conclusion that treatment in the infusion group is better than that in the bolus group.	0.8519782610149704
Concerns that a significantly higher consumption of analgesics would cause unwanted side-effects have proven unfounded.	0.48054798233184265
Six hours after surgery, when analgesia was evaluated by the patients, there was no significant difference between the two groups.	0.8078825247490723
Not until the maintenance infusion had been administered for a further 18 h, was the tramadol consumption within the infusion group significantly higher.	0.619965950425992
Thus, we should consider continuing unreduced administration of the maintenance infusion 6 h after operation.	0.6836341853821585
The concept of tuberculid was introduced by Darier in 1896.	0.32005030637422455
In contrast to "true" cutaneous tuberculosis, properties of the tuberculids were explained by an hyperergic response to myobacteria or their fragments released from a different site of manifest or passed tuberculous infection.	0.5077259479650379
Key features include a strongly positive tuberculin skin test, evidence of concomitant manifest or past tuberculosis, and prompt response to antituberculous therapy The inability to culture M. tuberculosis or to demonstrate it microscopically from lesional biopsies, together with reports on tuberculid-like eruptions after BCG vaccination, supports this concept.	0.45080465470157816
Clinical manifestations are lichen scrophulosorum, papulo-necrotic tuberculids and erythema induratum of Bazin.	0.2708604485630151
The existence of tuberculids has been questioned, however, because the clinical and histological appearances are not always specific.	0.7892109042509621
An increasing number of case reports on tuberculids, new immunological tests and molecular biology-based techniques for the detection of mycobacteria have shed new light on the tuberculid concept.	0.5380181233263909
Case Report: A 20-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital because of a pneumothorax.	0.8324496762085868
A secondary amenorrhea was coexisting.	0.19436793321923987
On the abdominal wall and in the anogenital area a maculopapular exanthema was visible.	0.5438603888596555
Chest X-ray and HR-CT showed a interstitial lung disease with high probability of histiocytosis X which was confirmed by biopsies of lung and skin tissue.	0.5773347765814503
The cause of amenorrhea was a histiocytic infiltration of the pituitary stalk.	0.5005653712104844
Conventional "consensus-treatment" for adults with vinblastine, prednisone and etoposide did not prevent relapsing bilateral pneumothoraces.	0.42476992262500657
Treatment was successful with the protocol as proposed by the international study for children.	0.4933359004647039

The prognosis of patients with malignant diseases requiring treatment on intensive care units is poor.	0.7839259385340059
The hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients ranges from 70-90% in patients with solid tumors to 75-90% in patients with hematological malignancy and up to 95% in patients after bone marrow transplantation.	0.8481992668078757
The number of patients referred to intensive care units is however increasing, due to improvements in the general treatment of malignant diseases.	0.6367156697652442
This results in controversies about the utilization of intensive care treatment in these patients.	0.5800712909374186
Since the individual outcome can not be predicted prior to initiation of intensive care therapy a general refusal of intensive care treatment seems not justified.	0.5573961228902536
A reevaluation of the patients status after initiation of intensive care treatment based on predefined criteria may however be useful in the decision about continuing intensive care measures.	0.6855650143410081
Patients requiring mechanical ventilation after bone marrow transplantation will not survive if prolonged treatment with vasopressors is necessary and/or sustained hepatic and renal failure is present.	0.5252198050055308
For these patients a withdrawal of further life support may be considered.	0.6248535988066959
Intensive care treatment should be continued in patients not fulfilling these criteria and treatment results are comparable to those in patients without malignant diseases.	0.7179276019286531
For other patients with malignant diseases the use of a new score system developed for patients with cancer can be helpful in the clinical decision making.	0.8351933268867685
On the basis of a solution-oriented marital therapy, the different within-session effects of four different types of questions in systemic therapy (lineal, strategic, circular, and reflexive), as described by Tomm (1989), were tested.	0.6517872440776856
In this single case study, the method of plan analysis (Caspar 1989) was used to categorize the client's reactions to the four types of therapeutic questions.	0.7446895464740589
Lineal and strategic questions were expected to have a stabilizing and restraining effect on the system (i.e.	0.5446799925499194
the client, the clients' interaction, and the therapeutic interaction), whereas circular and reflexive questions were expected to open the system for change.	0.7294093457863369
Interestingly this hypothesis was only supported for the wife, who had the role of the identified client in the therapy and demonstrated a much stronger motivation for change.	0.6862645351881418
For the husband, who preferred the role of a cotherapist and demonstrated only little motivation for change, results were not as predicted.	0.6210990633230614
Some of his reactions were even opposite to the expected therapeutic effects.	0.41951429710840543
Therefore, it is suggested that an interaction effect between questions and the motivation for change can be assumed.	0.7003181143366438
Prerequisites for experimental study designs are extremely difficult to realise under prehospital emergency conditions.	0.3389321371249499
Results obtained in animal experiments always need validation with prehospital or inhospital patient studies.	0.41032552229538316
Investigations related to emergency medicine are, however, an ethical obligation on behalf of the patient.	0.5243318338605394
A retrospective analysis of the available literature should be considered a prerequisite for prospective randomised and controlled studies.	0.8993006675985784
Frequently, a pilot study or feasibility trial needs to precede the actual study.	0.49024349618602503
Informed consent must be obtained for all patient studies.	0.3507599934037461
However, under emergency conditions informed consent cannot always be obtained due to unconsciousness, etc.	0.44483854283065094
Nevertheless, the following principles should be observed: (a) randomised studies are essential, even in emergency medicine; (b) they are ethically acceptable if the treatment provided for the study group is at least equivalent to the therapy for the control group; ( c) only these preconditions guarantee that the patient always receives treatment in accordance with the standard of treatment.	0.8570336555601932
If the patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to give informed consent, the principle of deferred consent is acceptable.	0.5869548436040074
The deferred consent principle should be carefully documented.	0.32930527238610935
A prospective randomized study represents the gold standard for an investigation, even under emergency conditions.	0.7231716596641229
There are different principles of randomization: telephone or telefax randomisation, etc.	0.3457750509475494
Emergency medicine investigations need to be completed within a reasonable time frame which should, as a rule, not exceed 2 years.	0.7433217940044126
Otherwise, too many items might change without being noted.	0.43408858780819276
Curative treatment and the intention to treat are terms employed by ethics committees.	0.49315323982265946
If an investigation does not bear in itself additional risk factors, it does not necessarily have to be brought before the ethics committee.	0.5693296741153598
If, however, for example, the effect of obtaining blood samples is investigated separately for research purposes, the patient needs to be informed and sign the respective agreement.	0.6578518261225068
In Germany the ethics committees have agreed to accept their respective decisions.	0.46394395624219315
For multicentre and multinational studies, however, the ethics committees also need to accept decisions made by non-German ethics committees.	0.4791708978241731
Not all therapeutic principles can serve as the basis of prospective randomized studies because they need to be considered the present standard of care (e.g., endotracheal intubation, etc.).	0.643089918164669
Nevertheless, the feasibility of a study should be assessed according to the 1-3 rating proposed by the American Heart Association.	0.7208873071235193
In principle, the overall emergency physician protocol does not fulfill scientific requirements.	0.5672615967484623
For all studies, particularly in the prehospital setting, an independent observer should be involved for documentation purposes.	0.6460934445471083
Scores can be of importance for investigating different treatment regimens.	0.4758078266677867
Biases in emergency medicine studies focus on the variability of EMS, personnel qualifications, etc.	0.45051617504198743
This is in part why it is extremely difficult to prove efficacy and efficiency in emergency medicine.	0.5590723090394863
The results of emergency medicine investigations should be published in suitable journals, i.e., journals with a reasonable rating.	0.5549212433067408
New antifungals for oral therapy have improved the chances of healing onychomycoses.	0.3948853152685559
Nevertheless, in daily practice the failure rate is 20-30% both with itraconazole and terbinafine.	0.7500129667338189
In our investigations for the fungicidal effects of terbinafine, we could show that the same strain of Trichophyton rubrum or T. mentagrophytes in the rest period needs 1000 times higher concentration of terbinafine (2,0 to 0,002 µg/ml) for complete fungal killing as in the growth phase.	0.6696470190411455
Thus resting fungi in the nail are not harmed, and if the concentration of terbinafine is lower than the MIC for the fungi, they can cause a relapse.	0.6813490156413607
Itraconazole is a fungistatic agent.	0.2025132365361857
Its concentration in the nail plate must be higher than the MIC for the causative fungi for a long time - 10 to 12 months.	0.7143325214164629
The usual short-term treatment of onychomycosis over 3 months can be insufficient in individual cases such as patients with disorders, e.g.	0.5528822318666684
circulatory disorders or slowed nail growth.	0.22148915297812244
This paper presents an algorithm for automatic switching between atrial tracking and nontracking pacing mode based on a "4 out of 7" concept: if 4 out of 7 atrial intervals are sensed below a critical value, mode switching (MS) is automatically performed.	0.569426815125878
The technical solution in Medtronic Kappa 700 dual chamber devices is explained together with an evaluation of advantages and possible limitations.	0.3776387596661076
The "4 out of 7" algorithm offers a quick MS; by the addition of a "blanked flutter search" algorithm integrated into this concept, the detection of atrial flutter is facilitated in a wider range of programmed AV intervals.	0.5977940552443811
With the increased rapidity of MS and sensitivity towards atrial flutter detection, there is also an increased propensity to switch to the nontracking mode in case of short atrial runs and frequent premature atrial beats.	0.5231725635946148
Therefore, to optimize the MS function, programming of the device (e.g., activation of a time delay before MS) should be carried out individually with respect to the intrinsic rhythm and arrhythmia of the patient.	0.6005891271618785
Possible interactions between different programmable parameters should also be taken into consideration.	0.4281426359308006
Some guidelines are presented in this paper.	0.5618891842031193
Finally, the use of extended stored diagnostic data seems to be crucial to evaluate pacemaker performance, incidence of atrial arrhythmias, and (as far as possible) confirmation of the stored data themselves by assessment of stored intracardiac electrograms.	0.6455372854721065
Between 1983 and 1991 ten patients with chronic frontal sinus disease underwent frontal osteoplastic flaps with fat obliteration.	0.509254589972822
In order to judge operative success on a long-term basis all patients were called for postoperative follow-up.	0.5303997555008269

MR was used in an attempt to show evidence for suppurative disease in the frontal sinus, but the MR images failed to correlate with symptoms.	0.7843627426482852
Additional results could not be obtained when compared to CT.	0.5402210669283343
Overall operating success could only be determined by clinical assessment and confirmed the value of the frontal osteoplastic flap with fat obliteration.	0.6313347426434508
The objective of our trial was to evaluate the significance and usefulness of sentinel lymphadenectomy (SLNE) for the staging of regional lymph nodes in breast cancer patients.	0.6892244594023856
The study presented illustrates the method and our results.	0.5477644458807052
As has been documentated for melanoma, the first lymph node [sentinel node (SLN)] to receive lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor is the expected first site of lymph-node metastasis.	0.5791217660795522
The database presented includes 12 patients with operable breast cancer and clinically negative lymph nodes.	0.3958066903890266
In 11 cases the described method was applicable.	0.5045767326119583
In only one case was there no correlation between the histology of the SLN and the axillary specimen.	0.571418682874401
Successful completion of examination of a large number of patients with a long follow-up has the potential of reducing the number of axillary dissections and of significantly reducing morbidity in the majority of breast cancer patients.	0.7510561799065987
Background: Information on the extent and degree of the thermal effect produced is of great importance for control of the laser dosage in laser thermokeratoplasty (LTK) and for postoperative follow-up.	0.7327075447625061
We investigated on acute LTK effects which information images obtained by optical low coherence tomography (OCT) offer compared to those obtained by polarization microscopy.	0.4715765808197817
In cases with protected left main stenosis by previous bypass surgery or as an emergency intervention in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is performed as an alternative treatment strategy to bypass surgery.	0.7283154010240909
A review of 262 left main angioplasties revealed a procedure-related mortality in cases without protection of the left main coronary artery of 9.1% (4/44), in cases with partially protected left main stenosis by collaterals to either left coronary artery of 4.8% (1/21) and 0.5% (1/187) in cases with nonobstructed bypass grafts to either left coronary artery.	0.8795449518715381
Coronary angioplasty of an unprotected left main coronary artery, had an unacceptably high procedure-related mortality rate and should therefore not be performed even in cases of emergency intervention.	0.6351306404104545
The risk stratification of the procedure can be evaluated by the proposed grading of left main artery protection.	0.7520913624140708
Hypocalcemia is a relatively uncommon reversible cause of congestive heart failure.	0.3900009176643573
There are a few reports of hypocalcemic children who developed congestive heart failure associated with hypoparathyroidism.	0.6003056639094403
In all these patients, however, cardiac failure did not occur before the age of nine years.	0.6037281499799503
In addition, other striking noncardial manifestations of hypoparathyroidism, e.g., convulsive seizures, had been present prior to cardiac symptoms.	0.5790565407540069
In this publication, Nager syndrome was analyzed in the literature and six patients from our clinic were evaluated in relation to symptoms, etiology and pathogenesis.	0.7438718875856178
The diseases to be considered when making a differential diagnostis are pointed out.	0.58490391945153
Clarification of the etiology is still pending.	0.5202634777374194
Molecular genetic research in these patients is possibly the key for new findings.	0.5412195880069289
A case report illustrates the results of interdisciplinary treatment by the surgeon and orthodontist.	0.7671184070932354

The results of ankle arthroplasty have generally been disappointing compared to other forms of arthroplasty.	0.5455327287236067
The present survey of results of ankle arthroplasty deals with the anatomical, the kinemasiological the biomechanical and the biological features of the ankle joint.	0.6960729535368513
These features all seem important prerequisites for a successful total ankle prosthesis design.	0.39232809014800146
From the study of the results displayed in the literature and those of my own series it can be stated that a modern ankle arthroplasty should respect the normal anatomy and kinemasiology.	0.7224680975680438
Biomechanically it should work as a normal ankle joint i. e. cylindrical mobility, congruency and a possibility for normal torque within the ankle mortise.	0.464809772934998
The prosthesis components should only be fixed in solid subchondral bone, and preferably without cement.	0.5118053106777496
Only compressible forces should act at the bone-prosthesis interface.	0.3843610125207538
The axis of the ankle joint as well as of that of the hindfoot should be aligned to normal.	0.8164537047286581
Meticulous surgery and special guide instruments are absolute necessities.	0.28863987513218536
Restoration of muscle power and gait postoperatively are essential for a good and lasting result.	0.6170002726899472
The indication for ankle arthroplasty is mainly cases of osteoarthritis (primary or traumatic) and rheumatoid arthritis.	0.6424411307142135
Contraindications are talus necrosis, Charcot joints, extreme osteoporosis, severe arteriosclerosis, and very aggressive arthritis.	0.5301696655096376
Mental disorders and neurological disorders may also be contraindications.	0.4931244489877689
Furthermore, the patients should agree not to perform sports involving jumping and running or other ankle demanding activities.	0.5938448034938579
The average annual failure rate should not exceed 1 % if these recommendations are followed.	0.5841056648970495
Elbow flexion plays a key role in the overall function of the upper extremity.	0.7362159289430896
In the case of unilateral complete brachial plexus lesion, restoration of elbow flexion will dramatically increase the patient's chances of regaining bimanual prehension.	0.5001018275500647
Furthermore, depending on the type of reconstruction, stability of the glenohumeral joint as well as some supination function of the forearm can be restored to a varying degree at the same time.	0.5357821797031096
Depending on the level of brachial plexus lesion and/or reinnervation, different reconstructive procedures are available.	0.5516428595754044
In order to select the best treatment option for the patient it is necessary to known the extent of the lesion of the brachial plexus and/or ventral upper arm muscles, to time the operation appropriately, to be aware of all treatment possibilities and to recall the special problems of tendon transfer for brachial plexus patients.	0.7143350115081181
Our concept is based on our experience with more than 1100 patients presenting a brachial plexus lesion between 1981 and 1996 and treated in our institution.	0.6707637562828626
There were 528 operative revisions of the brachial plexus.	0.323925018133127
Some 225 patients underwent secondary muscle/tendon transfers.	0.2645272314510456
In 35 patients elbow flexion was reconstructed by bipolar latissimus dorsi transfer (n = 10), triceps-to-biceps transfer (n = 15), modified flexor/pronator muscle mass proximalization (n = 6) and multiple-stage free functional muscle transfer after intercostal nerve transfer (n = 4).	0.4885392613484956
The official German guidelines for prevention of intravascular-device-associated infections were published by the Bundesgesundheitsamt, now called the Robert-Koch-Institut, 12 years ago.	0.43290251390871276
The recently published official "Guidelines for Prevention of Intravascular-Device Associated Infections" of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are categorized according to scientific evidence.	0.42094499958331993
The American guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the offical German guidelines.	0.26777168339659774
The purpose of the present paper is to inform the German-speaking anaesthesiologist about the official CDC guidelines and to provide an update on the prevention of intravascular-device-associated infections.	0.6134285228064856
We assessed the interindividual diagnostic variance of 39 experienced arthroscopists by the Kappa Cohen interobserver variation analysis using videotapes of eight different patients with different diagnoses.	0.4028913715769858
Arthroscopically normal findings showed a relatively acceptable interobserver correlation.	0.3753466918903553
Pathological changes, in contrast, often showed very little correlation, especially in the synovial membrane of the suprapatellar recess, in the cartilage of the femoropatellar groove and the posterior cruciate ligament.	0.7922030282467009
In patellar alignment there was also great interobserver variation.	0.4019429122103884
Clinical relevance: When comparing arthroscopic findings with other imaging techniques the above results should be taken into account.	0.4576497664030249
Furthermore, these results will affect the significance of medical expertise based only on pictures.	0.6002653841858735
In addition, medical cost billing, which is based on arthroscopic findings, has to take into account that a wrong diagnosis is possible and therefore charges will be wrong.	0.783198365354645
Squamous metaplasia can be demonstrated in about 4% of all invasive carcinomas of the breast.	0.9045062616606744
Primary squamous cell carcinomas of the breast are rare, since they occur in less than 1% of all primary invasive breast carcinomas.	0.8529035569561072
In order to classify a breast tumor as a primary squamous cell carcinoma one must exclude an epidermal origin, especially from the nipple region and the possibility of metastatic infiltration of the breast by a squamous cell carcnoma from a different location.	0.7096575338482402
Causative and formal pathogenesis of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is not clear.	0.6077526776413021
A pluripotent embryonal stem cell origin is discussed, considering the phylogenetic descent of the mammary gland from skin appendages.	0.3261882527818246
Squamous metaplasia is also suggested to be a precursor of squamous cell carcinoma.	0.629842388589224
Here endocrine stimulation and chronic inflammation may both play an inductive role.	0.3654500624840336
The number of published cases of squamous cell carcinomas developing years and decades after implantation of silicon prostheses has increased in recent years.	0.5483373373146136
These tumors probably develop on top of squamous metaplasia induced by the inflammatory pseudocapsule.	0.42115819905371893
The limited success of thrombolytic therapy and the high percentage of patients who have to be excluded from lysis has resulted in the alternative application of primary PTCA in acute myocardial infarction.	0.8121790595813488
Randomized studies so far available have shown a significant decrease of hospital mortality by primary PTCA as compared to thrombolysis.	0.6165137564214116
Adjuvant stent implantation and a wider administration of glycoprotein IIA/IIIB inhibitors may further reduce mortality.	0.3833338074077041
For logistic and financial reasons however, not all patients with acute myocardial infarction can benefit from this therapeutic approach in spite of the high density of health care in Germany.	0.8002388045593726
Primary PTCA in acute myocardial infarction should be left to experienced centres and investigators.	0.31876876384071073
Of utmost importance is a reduction of the present "onset-to-opening" times by information campaigns, an improved triage, use of transportation times for pre-hospital lysis and improved thrombolytic agents.	0.57316142356519
Some 245,000 sporting accidents occur yearly in Switzerland.	0.22712002306602477
The social accident costs amount to approximately 1.8 billion francs per year.	0.44343789642338804
Every second sporting accident occurs during a ball game.	0.2832945573763724
For the shown sporting activities, distortion is the most common type of injury among adults and contained fractures are most common in children.	0.6102603910469638
As is to be expected, the number of accidents has grown along with the exploding popularity of snowboarding and in-line skating.	0.6817671324054371
These new sporting activities show no unknown injury patterns which would demand new treatment methods.	0.32898218768373416
Abstract:  The combination of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the localization and functional characterization of the somatosensory and motor cortex.	0.5780829537629778
However, this method is technically pretentious and time consuming.	0.7370180049132674
Therefore, functional imaging is still not established as routine procedure in neurosurgery.	0.6638275360010156
The aim of the presented study was the development of a protocol, which allows the integration of functional MEG data into presurgical planning and intraoperative navigation, as a routine method.	0.959042160257325
We report on a 15-year-old girl and her relatives with typical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIII.	0.5573291153334051
Main symptoms of this disorder are fragile skin, easy bruisability, joint hypermobility, features suggesting premature aging, and periodontal disease with early loss of teeth.	0.5131896943299287
The inheritance of this type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is autosomal dominant.	0.3250816479384925
The biochemical and genetic defects have not yet been elucidated.	0.4329586137857993
The acute liver failure (ALF) is a complex syndrome resulting from loss of synthetic and metabolic functions of the liver.	0.6945836704233664
Despite recent advances in intensive care medicine patients with severe ALF have a very high mortality and the orthotopic liver transplantation still remains the only proven effective treatment of ALF.	0.66408262363499
Numerous attempts have been made to improve survival by using various extracorporeal support techniques, but none of these therapeutic approaches was able to increase the survival rate.	0.7057329043369401
Liver support systems based on detoxification procedures only could not influence the deleterious course of the disease.	0.44615281130959683
It is certain that an ideal liver support system should be capable to fulfil the liver's essential synthetic and metabolic functions as well as detoxification and excretion.	0.4022742329899298
Over the last years the development of hybrid liver assist devices has aimed at replacing these liver functions and therefore might give an advantage over earlier systems based on detoxification techniques only.	0.4948749975383251
This article gives a short review of the various liver support systems and focuses then on the hybrid liver support systems, their construction and the remaining problems after the first clinical applications.	0.7591441157327367
After a latency period of 20 years, in a 39-year-old Austrian citizen of Chinese origin, a surgically removed rectal carcinoma, as well as the neighboring chronic inflammatory rectal mucosa with various degrees of dysplasia and one positive neighboring lymph node, showed helminthiasis in the histopathological examination, convincing us of a link between carcinoma and chronic helminthiasis.	0.6012188605436981
Whereas the etiological context between chronic infection by Schistosoma haematobium and endemic frequent urinary bladder carcinoma is considered a matter of fact, whether of not the incidence of intestinal carcinoma is increased in connection with chronic intestinal schistosomiasis is controversial.	0.5264962935494374
The etiological and pathogenetic link between helminthiasis and carcinoma should be considered in the same way as for other related inflammatory large-bowel diseases.	0.5433154985254954
In the sequence chronic inflammation - severe dysplasia, the formation of carcinoma could possibly occur.	0.6471223795728268
Besides a survey of trematodes parasitology and pathology, the link between rectal carcinoma and Schistosomiasis japonicum is pointed out by means of appropriate literature investigations.	0.4889407832557519
Rupture of the carotid artery wall is a very rare postoperative complication.	0.5567198129799633
Mainly ruptures of vein patches are described in the literature.	0.40673679837213045
This paper reports on a 51-year-old patient with elective endarterectomy of the left internal carotid artery using V-Y technique.	0.6812027818488817
On day 8 after operation, the carotid bulb ruptured.	0.4993665058313072
The suture line was not involved.	0.272112833786521
The rupture was due to local wall necrosis, as verified by histologic examination.	0.5833150749408473
In an emergency procedure the necrotized tissue was resected and repaired using a Dacron patch.	0.49551992890069974
Postoperatively the patient showed paresis of the left recurrent nerve but fortunately did not suffer any other neurological deficit.	0.5747176394570519
Myocardial stunning (contractile dysfunction in the presence of normalized perfusion) and myocardial hibernation (contractile dysfunction matching reduced perfusion) have represented separate concepts of viable, but dyssynergic myocardium in the past.	0.6143730218453296
However, in vivo experimental and clinical work suggests that repetitive ischemia due to coronary artery disease may induce a gradual transition between stunned and hibernating myocardium.	0.5500328485454172
Myocardial hibernation itself can result from a spectrum of ischemic conditions ranging from impaired myocardial blood flow reserve to frank hypoperfusion.	0.41874843799385475
With increasing severity and duration of ischemia, degeneration of cardiac myocytes, accumulation of glycogen and cell death ensue.	0.49198974498625014
Additonally, there is an increase of extracellular matrix protein content leading to reparative fibrosis, which in turn limits functional recovery.	0.682149397494334
In the light of these structural features, the available methods for detection of viable myocardium, in particular dobutamine echocardiography and nuclear imaging techniques, offer complementary rather than contradictory information.	0.684051068360866
Dobutamine echo has satisfactory sensitivity, excellent specificity, and high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of viable dyssynergic myocardium.	0.6265106228507367
While in the past only its predictive accuracy for segmental recovery has been validated, newer data show an improved survival after revascularization if at least four viable dyssynergic left ventricular segments in a 16 segment model can be identified by dobutamine echocardiography.	0.49171284179441377
The complete (low and high dose) dobutamine protocol can elicit several types of contractile responses (sustained improvement in contraction or monophasic response, biphasic response, new wall motion abnormality) which should be interpreted in view of other clinical data including a previous infarction.	0.5962159424660826
The test protocol can be used safely at the end of the first week after myocardial infarction.	0.757836705550749
If ischemia or viability is documented, revascularization should be performed promptly.	0.4900369180291727
A similar strategy should be followed in the setting of chronic coronary heart disease with left ventricular dysfunction.	0.5248612841664799
Since the structural changes of hibernating myocardium are progressive, time to revascularization is critical.	0.5052644765497518
On the other hand, responsible therapeutic planning requires proof of ischemia or viability before initiating a potentially hazardous revascularization procedure.	0.33438511301886853
The coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aorta in the transitional area between the distal aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta.	0.6332935062439754
The coarctation causes an arterial hypertension of the upper half and an arterial hypotension of the lower half of the body.	0.7542426965287167
The indication for operative repair is given because of the hypertension with strain and possible insufficiency of the heart.	0.629563412113728
The resection of the narrowed part of the aorta with end-to-end anastomosis or interposition of a prosthesis brings on the risk of a recoarctation.	0.6458597419689867
After a Vosschulte-aortoplasty a recurrent coarctation is rarely seen.	0.34678147700589607
This method, however, brings on a higher risk of the development of an aneurysm.	0.6387832875703516
In the following it is reported about a patient who underwent an operation due to an aneurysm 22 years after a Vosschulte-aortoplasty.	0.7416718602749434
The aging of the Italian population is an emerging public health priority.	0.3678234062781209
In 2025 Italy is expected to have the highest world median age with nearly half of the population over 50 years old.	0.6319105801159203
To avoid an unbearable burden of disease and disability on future generations, we must identify areas for intensive disease and disability prevention programs.	0.6663052306824516
A 14 year old macedonic girl was admitted with recurrent colicky abdominal pain that had lasted for several weeks.	0.3842132025700681
Laboratory check, plain abdominal film and abdominal sonography did not show abnormalitities immediately.	0.41806965476476354
Increasing enzyme parameters though indicated cholestasis.	0.16192672235935396
Endoscopic retrograde choledocho-pancreaticography (ERCP) was performed after abdominal sonography showed a dilatation of the choledochus.	0.6190134011739703
It revealed a common-channel situation (ductus choledochus and pancreaticus) and choledocholithiasis.	0.48850458686838166
Papillotomy and stone-extraction could not remove abdominal pain.	0.24115014579354854
Laparatomy and choledocho-jejunostomy could finally remove the symptoms.	0.20105663116669206
Successful transplantation of autologous chondrocytes for repair of articular cartilage defects requires an undisturbed matrix-synthesis of the transplanted cells.	0.5469845557143923
This, in turn, is dependent on the composition of the synovial fluid (SF) of the respective joint.	0.8554139577666675
We addressed the question whether analysis of a patient's SF can predict the rate of matrix-synthesis of articular cartilage exposed to this SF in vitro.	0.6966810174171566
SF was obtained from 115 patients with disorders of the knee, including gonarthrosis (n = 44), meniscal tears (n = 10), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 53), and reactive arthritides (n = 8).	0.5845349761971399
In the SF, the following parameters were determined: Interleukin-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1-RA, TNF, Insulin-like growth-factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II, IGF-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), IGFBP-3 as well as total proteinase activity and total collagenase activity.	0.6472025231625532
To assess the effect of SF on the matrix synthesis of articular chondrocytes, bovine cartilage was incubated in the presence of SF, and the rate of proteoglycan synthesis subsequently determined.	0.602826412594034
In some cases, a monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-I was added.	0.5621106213679147
SF from patients with OA or trauma, respectively, stimulated PG-synthesis of bovine cartilage more markedly than did SF from patients with rheumatic arthritides.	0.490454847663434
On the average, 60 percent of the SF-induced increase of cartilage matrix synthesis could be titrated out by an anti-IGF-I-AB.	0.5258336126040074
The best predictor for the SF-effects on PG-synthesis of exposed cartilage was the proportion of free IGF-I (r = 0.573, p < 0.001, Spearman rank correlation) followed by the SF-concentrations of IGF-I (with a positive sign), IGFBP-3, IL-1, and TNF (all with a negative sign).	0.6119402094070272
According to our data, IGF-I is the most important anabolic factor in human SF with respect to cartilage PG-synthesis.	0.6215327334441725
The proportion of free IGF-I seems to be of special importance in this regard.	0.6166675576740066
Low SF-levels of free IGF-I could be identified as a possible risk-factor for a sub-optimal protoeglycan synthesis of chondrocytes exposed to this synovial milieu.	0.609507235537377
The coincidence between panic disorder and depression is a well known phenomenon.	0.4947854132667924
However, only few studies investigated the coincidence of panic disorder with schizophrenia.	0.6595783084056811
This may in part be explained by the fact that both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia may mask the clinical symptoms of a panic disorder.	0.5922070607457839
We report on a female patient suffering both from agoraphobia with panic disorder and paranoid schizophrenia according to ICD-10.	0.48764500615522893
The productive psychotic symptoms responded well to treatment with a low dose of zotepine, whereas the panic disorder was effectively treated with a combined therapy with imipramine and cognitive behavioral therapy.	0.6910495219619066
Although it has to be questioned whether the coincidence between panic disorder and schizophrenia reflects two different diagnostic entities, the occurence of symptoms of a panic disorder in schizophrenia deserve further attention because these may be treated efficiently by a specific pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.	0.5351486791946013
A 54-year-old female patient with a 10-year history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt resulting from communicating hydrocephalus of undetermined aetiology is reported.	0.5233274352503404
Transient gait disturbances and cerebral infarction at the age of 46 did not lead to further insights into the nature of the disease.	0.5862239740188494
After many years with only occasional disturbances, a distinct organic brain syndrome developed.	0.484576894730869
Thorough examination led to a tentative diagnosis of neurocysticercosis; this was based on the history, liquor diagnosis and cerebral microcalcifications in CT.	0.6481401939406432
Despite the initiation of specific therapy, the patient died of the sequelae of the disease.	0.9406259253595297
At autopsy, characteristic cicatricial residues of mainly basal leptomeningitis were found with collapsed parasitic cysts.	0.3937588003055963
Additional intracerebral mesenchymal-glial reactions were less conspicuous.	0.259412124102078
Residual ependymitis had caused aqueductal stenosis.	0.16724498703744167
Death was due to cachexia, bronchopneumonia and a lung abscess.	0.3352094023576615

The prognosis can be influenced in a positive way.	0.5159219468643013
Diagnosis of bacterial infection and/or sepsis in critically ill patients is a common problem in intensive care medicine.	0.6735275011392993
White blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are often used in the differential diagnosis of infection versus SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) due to noninfectious causes.	0.6922319584107379
There is a number of non-infectious stimuli to cause leucocytosis and CRP elevation.	0.5493501476998772
In the last 3 years, Procalcitonin (PCT) was determined to be a marker of severe bacterial infection, especially sepsis.	0.8908207556322328
PCT appears to have several advantages; it is of non-hepatic (yet unknown) origin and useful in patients with hepatic insufficiency.	0.5927748956359703
There is no PCT-increase in acute graft-rejection, viral disease, and autoimmune disorders.	0.5626994497269541

At this time significantly higher costs are the major detraction to daily or frequent measurements.	0.4335603420826409
In this retrospective study, the meniscal status of 45 patients with conservatively treated complete anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears is reported.	0.45093060230984605
The ACL injury was initially documented by examination under anesthesia and arthroscopy.	0.42983484440062497
Treatment in all cases consisted of a standard protocol of early rehabilitation and bracing.	0.7207704751164076
The mean follow-up was 8 years.	0.6068098767213753
Twenty-nine (65%) patients showed signs of meniscal pathology at an average of 3 years after the ACL injury during the follow-up period.	0.783341311499739
Rearthroscopy was performed and showed a higher incidence of medial meniscus tears.	0.6333143093723699
The most common tear of the medial meniscus was the bucket-handle type, followed by the flap tear and the single longitudinal split of the posterior horn.	0.680591008820397
Secondary reconstruction of the ACL was necessary in 24 patients complaining of the meniscus giving way.	0.6569846601169002
The remaining five patients had rearthroscopy 4 years after the ACL injury and a partial meniscectomy and ACL reconstruction was performed.	0.6570163371307015
Sixteen patients (35% of the overall sample) had no instability complaints or meniscal pathology during the follow-up period, but discontinued their sporting activities.	0.7316310482511363
Results indicate the increasing incidence of meniscal tears during ACL insufficiency.	0.37692877175558187
We recommend that patients with ruptures of the ACL should be investigated for meniscal tears and that early ligament reconstruction of the knee and mensical repair or partial meniscectomy should be considered simultaneously.	0.7519613357969518
Four children, 4 to 10 years old, with chronic uveitis were treated with cyclosporin A (CsA; starting dosage 2 mg/kg per day) and prednisolone.	0.7979154004483088
All children had previously received systemic steroids and/or cytotoxic agents, which resulted either in a poor therapeutic effect or in intolerable side effects.	0.5585799642633875
In one child, suffering from uveitis in combination with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, a complete reduction of intraocular inflammation was achieved.	0.4973596727484288
In a second child treatment resulted in a marked reduction of inflammatory activity with stabilization of visual function, although a temporary increase in the steroid dosage was necessary at one stage.	0.6535337612616315
In the remaining two cases therapy failed to improve the intraocular inflammation.	0.6792460693913192
During the time of treatment, ranging from 11 to 26 months, no serious side effects were observed.	0.6844611153893376
All patients developed moderate hypertrichosis and one child gingival hyperplasia.	0.38546772940328977
In our <\d> experience, cyclosporin A (CsA) combined with low-dose systemic steroids is useful as a therapeutic alternative to steroids alone and to other immunosuppressive agents in severe cases of chronic uveitis in childhood.	0.6824869314984552
Allergic reactions in tattoos are comparatively rare.	0.23709904524990422
In most cases the reactions are caused by different red pigments.	0.615529245318125
While in the past these reactions have been ascribed to mercury salts (cinnebar) and cadmium sulphide, now synthetic inorganic azo dyes have also been found to be responsible for such reactions.	0.5795427067924216
A 42-year-old man presented with an allergic reaction in the red parts of his tattoos.	0.6174496067173223
Histologically a chronic granulomatous, partly fibrous inflammation with transfollicular elimination of pigment granules was found.	0.373446607476794
Spontaneous regression in a part of the inflammatory reaction was observed, simultaneously with depigmentation and scarring of the overlying skin.	0.4867587109039874
The pigment used for tattooing was found to be an aromatic azo derivative.	0.5455466850917186

Flagellin gene  (60 specimens) or OspA-plasmid  (32 specimens) were used as targets.	0.9311173410913021
Sensitivity of the flagellin-nested-PCR was 27%, by OspA-nested-PCR only one positive PCR result was found.	0.49365308639186617
Despite of low sensitivity PCR enabled the correct diagnosis of LD in two patients classified as UA.	0.5342670633115074
Therefore, PCR can give valuable hints in single cases if LD is clinically suspected.	0.34872897436501665
Objective: To assess the clinical efficacy of a chemically standardized willow bark extract in the treatment of osteoarthritis.	0.6105662131884488
Methods: Willow bark extract, in a dose corresponding to 240mg salicin/day, was compared to placebo in a 2-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.	0.7178237303405636
The primary outcome measure was the pain dimension of the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index.	0.4483836256591594
Secondary outcome measures included the stiffness and physical function dimensions of the WOMAC, daily visual analogue scales (VAS) on pain and physical function, and final overall assessment by both patients and investigators.	0.6197999947385221
Results: 78 patients (39 willow bark extract, 39 placebo) participated in the trial.	0.6386109049637992
A statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo group was observed in the WOMAC pain dimension (d=6.5mm, 95%C.I.=0.2-12.7mm, p=0.047); the WOMAC pain score was reduced by 14% from baseline level after two weeks of active treatment, compared to an increase of 2% in the placebo group.	0.6926031373769559
Patient diary VAS confirmed this result, and likewise the final overall assessments showed superiority of willow bark extract over placebo (patients assessment, p=0.0002; investigators assessment, p=0.0073).	0.4298416209558832
Conclusion: Willow bark extract shows a moderate analgesic effect in osteoarthritis.	0.35830570072989315
Background and methods: The aim of this study was to get more information about the prevalence of chronic pain in different practices of home physicians.	0.6468085412899744
900 patients of five different specialists (general medicine, internal medicine, neurology, orthopaedics, surgery) in the german town Bochum were investigated with a questionnaire about chronic pain.	0.692145753537181
Chronic pain was defined as a continuous or intermittend pain of longer duration than six months.	0.5159083950948653
Confusion between syncope and epileptic seizures is a common problem in clinical practice.	0.5713388875162605
Recently, new insights into the phenomenology of transient cerebral hypoxia have been gained from video analysis of experimentally induced syncope.	0.47829047972627764
Common elements of syncope include multifocal and generalized myoclonus, tonic body extension, automatisms, vocalizations, eye deviations and hallucinations.	0.36850512926369006
Thus, it is not the presence or absence of these features but their specific character that distinguishes syncope from epileptic seizures.	0.611107948819243
Other clues for differential diagnosis include precipitating factors, premonitory symptoms and postictal events, such as tongue bites and postictal confusion, which has been identified as the single most powerful factor discriminating syncope from epileptic seizures.	0.5434927521707028
In contrast, incontinence and head injury are common in both conditions.	0.4107961658976154
Investigations such as electroencephalogram, tilt testing and postictal prolactin or creatine kinase levels may aid diagnosis but are never diagnostic in isolation.	0.31055495786330045
In rare cases, hypoxic and epileptic mechanisms may interact within one attack.	0.4106087615101965
In the past two decades increasing research efforts have focused on the molecular biology of the cell.	0.7209136857880255
In the beginning, these research activities were purely academic without any direct clinical relation.	0.4284955576954365
A series of important discoveries, initiated particularly by the unravelling of the genetic code and the discovery of the molecular basis of gene expression and genetics, the subsequent identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and finally the description of major mechanisms which induce genetic instability in cells, now indicate the way to many new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.	0.5781989308894007
In surgical oncology, these attempts are yielding the first clinical consequences.	0.5785400076219174
Basic aspects of molecular cell biology as far as they are relevant for surgical oncologists are discussed.	0.4469593121221864
The compartment syndrome (cs) is characterized by an increased tissue pressure in a limited space.	0.6971228959663767
Pathophysiologically, it is a multifactorial disease that is potentially induced by an initial trauma and develops according to the existence of cofactors.	0.6088348779349957
Cofactors are, for instance, the circulation of the patient and the initial treatment of the impending cs.	1.0121480059163774
In particular, the microcirculation is altered with endothelial destruction, development of a capillary leak, protein loss from intravasal space and the development of an interstitial and intracellular third space.	0.5903305542551376
An impaired drainage of the lymphatic and venous system causes a venous infarction.	0.48592239898098516
An arterial infarction results if the tissue pressure exceeds the arteriolar pressure.	0.33338561189525134
An accompanying ischemia reperfusion mechanism increases the trauma load.	0.28355183930084943
In disadvantageous cases, the patients are in danger of developing a multi-organ deficiency syndrome (MODS) by an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction, by intravasal volume loss and by a myonephropathic systemic reaction.	0.6853977036778652
Clinically, the patients suffer a disproportionate amount of pain, followed by neurological signs.	0.6342012966010643
Especially in noncompliant patients, tissue pressure measurement is useful.	0.5242844140976753
Resuscitation of the circulation as well as splitting of casts is important.	0.4309057127349272
In case of a manifest cs, dermatofasciotomy has to be performed as an emergency operation.	0.8602413997524659
Even if cs is diagnosed early and fasciotomy is carried out early, the development of sequellae cannot be avoided in every single case.	0.5097625272811684
The object of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the value of open and arthroscopic procedures at mid-term and long-term follow-up.	0.5817552019634926
During the period from January 1980 to June 1997 we performed 247 open (technique: 134 according to Eden-Hybbinette-Lange, 46 according to Weber, 26 according to Putti-Platt, 41 according to Bankart) and 76 arthroscopic (transglenoidal Morgan technique) shoulder stabilization procedures.	0.5114659961417369
The mean follow-up for techniques was: Eden-Hybbinette-Lange 11.1 years (2.9-16.7 years), Weber 5.2 years (2.1-13.0 years), Putti-Platt 7.2 years (2.2-10.6 years), Bankart 1.6 years (0.5-3.2 years), and Morgan 3.5 years (2.8-5.1 years).	0.981043615479438
We observed that the classic open Bankart procedure has superior results according to the criteria redislocation, range of motion, sports activity, and arthrosis in comparison with the other open procedures.	0.6783644211663641
The results shows that nonanatomical, reconstructive, open procedures are not up to date.	0.5293086940929758
The open Bankart procedure reconstructs the pathology of the anterior glenoid rim only.	0.6343245624853833
The classic open Bankart procedure seems to be the "gold standard" in open shoulder surgery today.	0.6105235852388962
The high redislocation rate of the arthroscopic procedure warrants a more stringent patient selection in the future.	0.5085289892650298
Background: Our study compared the haemodynamic changes after spinal anaesthesia with 2% lignocaine and 0,5% plain bupivacaine.	0.643347340016748
Hyperkalemia is a frequent disturbance.	0.5189764636525628
When hyperkalemia is associated with a rapid rise of the serum potassium concentration, the risk of cardiac impairment is greatest.	0.6518122866013535
Usually the cooperative action of several causative factors is required to bring about a hyperkalemia.	0.4469648276628868
Increasing age, diabetes mellitus, disorders of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, high-dose antibiotics, and immunsuppressive treatments may result in hyperkalemia.	0.6410734432641161
The most important pathogenetic mechanisms are (1) renal insufficiency, (2) hyporeninemic hypoaldeosteronism, (3) tubular disorders, and (4) cellular disorders.	0.7038629200738645
Background: CMV retinitis is the most common opportunistic ocular infection and the main cause of blindness in AIDS patients with a T-helper cell count <= 50/µl.	0.7137489844136861
Cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue with a long half-life time after phosphorylation intracellularly.	0.3964524920256144
It is effective against CMV and can be given intravenously and intravitreally.	0.5396353619418689
The aim was to offer an alternative therapy for CMV retinitis to patients who could not receive standard treatment because of contraindications or refused it.	0.538463529301783
The efficacy and tolerance of intravitreal injections of cidofovir should be evaluated.	0.4786394512437627
A case of multiple eccrine spiradenomata is reported.	0.4921278436214462
One of the tumours was histopathologically associated with dermal cylindroma, and immunohistochemical studies showed that the cylindroma cells differentiate towards the secreting portion of the eccrine sweat gland.	0.5689785362213429
The relationship among multiple eccrine spiradenomata, dermal cylindroma and multiple trichoepitheliomata is discussed.	0.35454230643104684
In view of the risks of a varicella infection during pregnancy and the more and more observed severe course of infection, varicella infection has to be considered as a serious disease.	0.7344111874550999
The initial antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningoencephalitis has major implications for the course of the disease.	0.4761610606505504
The current spectrum of infectious agents must be considered.	0.4435689332180267
Antibiotics have to reach sufficient concentrations in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid for a bactericidal action to occur at the site of infection.	0.5291648255127606
Frequent problems arising in this condition are: (1) the non-observation of listerial infections, (2) the use of antibiotics not sufficiently active against gram-positive bacteria in pneumococal meningitis, (3) the development of meningitis following the use of ciprofloxacin in respiratory tract infections, (4) the hasty change in antibiotic regimens in focal parenchymal infections during delayed response to therapy, (5) the use of bacteriostatic antibiotics, and (6) the delay in administering sufficient antibiotic therapy during fulminate meningococcal meningitis.	0.7230550719665024
Problems arising from these conditions are illustrated by case reports.	0.3885838634178666
Therapy of rheumatoid arthritis with a combination of several disease-modifying drugs aims towards better control of the disease than achievable by monotherapy.	0.5667663495964529
Based on a broad variety of clinical studies, revealing more or less positive results, several combinations have been suggested:...	0.7042693566425002
The management of 178 patients with liver trauma (132 male, 46 female; mean age 34 years (range 3-88) presenting from January 1979 to August 1996 is reviewed.	0.6172943530041717
There were 165 cases of blunt trauma and 13 cases of penetrating injury.	0.4475284960243017
110 cases were classified as simple injuries (grade I or II) and 68 cases as complex injuries (grade III to V).	0.6331654364670668
The overall mortality was 32 % (57 patients).	0.7407958444117614
The mortality for true hepatic injury was 15.7 %.	0.5269431826343078
None of the patients with penetrating injuries died.	0.9166475137431783
Mortality was inflenced by the type of liver injury and the number of associated injuries.	0.47166380178244277
The postoperative complication rate was 55 %.	0.5427401229890922
The most-frequent postoperative complications related to the hepatic injury were intrahepatic or subcapsular hematoma (12.9 %) and postoperative bleeding (9.6 %).	0.7381878063008229
Intraabdominal abscess formation was seen in 2.8 %.	0.6578102450734119
Operative therapy for liver injuries depends on the grade of the injury.	0.5687891552938755
The majority of liver injuries can be managed by simple techniques, including electrocautery and application of hemostatic agents.	0.6363157578707644
In complex injuries hepatotomy, direct vessel ligation, and debridement of necrotic tissue is the method of choice (Pachter's procedure).	0.5563453465074266
In non-controlled bleeding, perihepatic picking is a standard method.	0.5045724617180068
Aim: The aim of the present study was to investigate knowledge, practices, and opinions on tobacco and oral health among dentists of the Berlin Dental Association using a questionnaire.	0.6352174438600564
Materials and methods: Questions focussed on smoking habits, knowledge about oral malignancies and premalignancies and practical approaches to screening for oral mucosal diseases and other associations of tobacco with oral changes.	0.43373356774912175
The questions related to risk factors and behavioural counselling for patients and associated constraints.	0.6554388201729051
Results: Of a total of 4000 questionnaires sent, 483 were received for evaluation (12.1%).	0.5499119660854125
Of respondents 9.5% were regular smokers.	0.6569578857831092
The median number of oral malignancies observed was 3.	0.32051138020735936
Knowledge about some associations of oral changes such as wound healing was adequate.	0.352152087156469
A total of 93.1% of respondents would refer patients with oral lesions.	0.5831693957068621
Only 35% take a regular history of both tobacco and alcohol consumption and 26.6% explain the side effects of tobacco.	0.5555585700531017
Some 73.4% believed that the dentist could play a role in anti-tobacco counselling.	0.44423667400522665
Limiting factors were lack of training and of competence in anti-tobacco counselling.	0.38420106149745703
Conclusions: This study shows that there still is a considerable need for improvement of knowledge and for provision with effective anti-tobacco teaching material.	0.5888543689524806
Since most of the respondents thought that the dentist should play a role in anti-tobacco counselling, adequate programmes in Germany should be inititated and followed up.	0.5537824023513868
Background: Last year's pilot study, which examined for the first time a representative group of patients with Chagas disease, showed that in this parasitosis changes in the ocular fundus can be expected in the form of defects of the retinal pigment epithelium.	0.7604986724993863
Examination of more patients in this study should give further information about the character and extent of the alterations found.	0.6389303881346896
The posterior luxation of the shoulder joint is a rarely reported and often not recognized lesion in the clinical workday.	0.7510849797266302
The authors present the first case of a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint in combination with an contralateral anterior shoulder joint fracture dislocation.	0.6429892832463676
In that case the authors stress the importance of an exact clinical and radiology diagnostic and the right way to reduce a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint.	0.5377552701688624

The relevance of MR spectroscopy and fetal MRI is discussed.	0.377736369375161
Currently laparoscopic surgery is limited by several factors.	0.5365276674047338
One of them is the precise handling of optics.	0.46922540181910827
Up to now, in our hospital 52 laparoscopic operations have been done with a voice - controlled robot arm to handle the optics in gallbladder, stomach, large bowel and hernia operations.	0.6965588597892898
The visual field is determined by the surgeon.	0.6642607126388491

Urine specimens were collected from 49 persons up to 10 days after abstaining from cannabis use.	0.5363079289485669
Urine samples (n = 135) were investigated for free and conjugated 9-carboxy-11-nor tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) by LC/MS/MS and for free and glucuronidated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) by GC/MS prior to and after enzyme hydrolysis.	0.6763268549717005
Concentrations for free and conjugated THCCOOH were measured with reference to 100 mg creatinine/dL urine.	0.5209663435525855
Cannabis use was classified as light, moderate and heavy according to the current literature.	0.5837830841454716
In all groups chosen free and bound THCCOOH was present in urine samples on the day of the last use and on the next day.	0.6882601447339233
Urine samples from occasional and frequent users generally differed in the amount of THCCOOH and THCCOOH glucuronide.	0.3399478821934689
Within 4-6 days the concentrations of free and glucuronidated THCCOOH in urine samples of heavy users decreased to those ranges present in urine samples of moderate and light users.	0.5572995629296502
In frequent users, THC glucuronide and 11-OH-THC glucuronide could be found up to 1 and 3 days after abstinence, respectively.	0.5728077176320935
In light users, neither THC glucuronide nor 11-OH-THC glucuronide was detectable.	0.4121130097772329
The determination of conjugated THC and 11-OH-THC in addition to free and bound THCCOOH is suggested as an aid in assessing the frequency of cannabis use, but is limited to samples obtained within a few days after the last consumption.	0.6687408557708466
The participation of social work in inpatient psychiatric care is generally considered necessary, but there is a lack of empirical studies in this field.	0.7294421739216579
The analyses presented of a systematic documentation of social work interventions in 2038 cases during an 11-year period demonstrate that social workers are mostly involved in the treatment of chronic and previously treated patients.	0.6357340665773352
Interventions in younger patients, most of whom are suffering from psychoses, aim at rehabilitation through activity; in elderly patients with organic or depressive disorders, the major concern is to improve posthospital care; patients with neurotic or personality disorders comprise another group with a chronic course and a relatively poor outcome.	0.6670061997348711
As far as their goals are comparable, social workers and doctors agree on their objectives.	0.5485918713253773
Social workers usually see their own interventions as successful, but patient groups who benefit greatly can be differentiated from groups with poor outcome.	0.5013754972909331
Stiff-man syndrome is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by muscular rigidity and superimposed spasms.	0.6343232151988305

X-ray or CT images allow only a limited three-dimensional orientation in presurgical planning.	0.5780664631831933
Especially for the planning of internal hemipelvectomies with custom-made endoprosthesis and for periacetabular osteotomies a high-grade orientation is necessary.	0.5901868480053668
This orientation is improved by a 3D CT-controlled manufactured 1:1 model of the pelvis.	0.6165810331408059
This enables an exact classification of defect and deformity, planning of resection planes, design of the suitable custom-made implant and simulation of the operation technique as preoperative quality control.	0.5148877782720337
An Ivalon-plug (PDA-plug) has been developed for transvenous closure of patent ductus arteriosus.	0.5536712467205641
It can be introduced into the ductus through standard venous sheaths with a diameter von 8-16 French.	0.5432742564957884
The plug is fixed in its target position by means of four distal (aortal) and two proximal (pulmonary) nitinol struts.	0.5129564511901163
In case of malpositioning the system can be pulled back into and retrieved through the sheath.	0.4106815021524033
In animal experiments endothelialization of the implanted material was demonstrated.	0.44757572323164063

During a follow-up of up to 24 months there were no complications.	0.7144807433467903
Using 8 different monoclonal antibodies, immunohistology was performed on 36 follicular adenomas and on 28 follicular, 34 papillary, 27 medullary and 29 anaplastic carcinomas of the thyroid.	0.5426945537590461
The panel of antibodies was directed against broad-spectrum cytokeratins (pan-CK, antibody lu-5), against basic and acid high-molecular-weight CK of types  1, 5, 10 and 14, against basic ( 5 and 6) and acid high-molecular-weight CK ( 13) and against basic ( 7 and  8) and acid low-molecular-weight CK ( 19 and  20).	0.7594700919303838
With the exception of a large number of anaplastic carcinomas, nearly all other tumours exhibited strong immunoreactivity with antibodies against pan-CK, CK 8 and CK 19.	0.44849093045826066
CK 20 expression was exclusively shown for 2 medullary carcinomas.	0.31446872559412103
Reactivity for high-molecular-weight CK could only, each time focally, be demonstrated for 14 papillary and 2 follicular carcinomas and for 2 anaplastic carcinomas with partial squamous differentiation.	0.5545208918047098
Thirteen anaplastic carcinomas were not decorated by any of the CK antibodies applied.	0.3801511219857369
CK 7 staining exceeding the staining of individual cells was observed in 26 papillary cancers.	0.4563017385728196
In contrast, such a finding could only be obtained with each one follicular adenoma, medullary carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma and with 5 follicular carcinomas.	0.611690341875085
These results confirm earlier studies in that CK 20 expression among thyroid tumours is restricted to the neuroendocrine medullary carcinomas and that in a larger percentage of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas an epithelial phenotype can not be demonstrated even upon using broad-spectrum CK antibodies.	0.5192083953453256
New is the finding that there exist considerable differences between papillary carcinomas and all other non-papillary thyroid tumours regarding CK 7 expression.	0.4251051447332926
This result might be of differential diagnostic value for the distinction of follicular and papillary thyroid neoplasias which sometimes have an overlapping histological pattern.	0.46273017814359835

Perioperative, mostly silent ischaemia in patients with coronary heart disease is difficult to detect by clinical examinations.	0.6932150795655817
Herpes simplex viruses are known to be among the most common disease-causing microorganisms.	0.6251358773541201
Their prevalence can exceed 90% depending on the socioeconomic status of the population.	0.4635690789047873
Since the number of immunocompromised patients has increased because of the increased incidence in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and an increase in organ transplantation, herpes virus infection may have a greater clinical significance.	0.5859120690222804
While treatment of otherwise healthy individuals will not usually cause any clinical problems herpes infection in an immunocompromised patient can have severe consequences.	0.41061346243997826
Additionally, development of viral resistance can be observed that may require alternative drugs in treatment.	0.5875542314271847
We present a case history of a man with a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia that was associated with a very unusual herpes simplex virus infection in the nasal vestibule.	0.7957116473507797
Possible causes for the development of resistance in herpes infections and the use of famciclovir and forscarnet as two therapeutic alternatives to aciclovir are discussed.	0.37542270986094456
Tumor invasion of the portal vein by ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head is classically known as a criterion for inoperability.	0.4667056918804063
Despite improvement in operation techniques for portal vein resection during Whipple's procedure and acceptable mortality and morbidity, in the case of uncertain tumor infiltration vascular resection cannot be recommended in general.	0.5645831375896263
The problem is the preoperative detection of tumor infiltration of the portal vein.	0.6576631638859013
Often the surgeon is confronted with unsuspected macroscopic portal vein infiltration or tumor adhesion during the operation.	0.4394939206844162
Between 1986 and 1995 105 patients underwent Whipple's procedure for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head in our department.	0.4495199857862518
In eight of these cases partial portal vein resection was performed because of macroscopic tumor infiltration or tumor adhesion.	0.5919002510598788
In all eight cases the preoperative diagnostic procedures with CT and portography did not show any suspicion of tumor infiltration.	0.5776256751587442
In four of the eight cases histological tumor infiltration of all vascular layers was found.	0.47473811285388556
In the others we found no or only adventitial tumor invasion.	0.538268560392294
The patients without tumor infiltration of the portal vein showed a survival time after surgery of 27.78 months in contrast to 6.67 months in the group with histologically proven tumor infiltration.	0.7089875034205423
Endovascular, intraportal ultrasound (IPEUS), a new diagnostic procedure, can give helpful information regarding portal vein involvement.	0.6041917971047072
Although the IPEUS is not a standard diagnostic procedure it was shown to detect portal vein infiltration with high sensitivity and specificity.	0.6932397888316719
Our results indicate that in such cases where portal vein infiltration has been excluded by IPEUS, patients with macroscopic tumor adhesion do benefit from partial portal vein resection.	0.5571247603751058
Progression in medical research and economic needs require new planning and organization of treatment strategies.	0.3710860353181553
This does also apply for stroke treatment: New pathophysiological knowledge, positive results of thrombolytic therapy and the demostrated importance of early treatment at Stroke Units justify that stroke must be regarded as an emergency.	0.5866756309858938
Timing is of utmost importance.	0.23455272578265993
Time-based management serves as a planning model for a new stroke treatment strategy.	0.4481776967883171
The treatment process is divided into three phases: alarming, pre-hospital and in-hospital phase.	0.6109896750557952
The effectiveness of each of these phases is influenced by several variables (personnel, technical equipment, course of the disease, etc.).	0.5903773234304893
Knowledge of each separate phase helps to discover weaknesses, which allows an aimed improvement, e.g.	0.5334712051899214
public education, training of paramedics and medical personnel.	0.457185201792973
Modern communication systems allow new information transfer, which can help to avoid unnecessary transport of patients.	0.7767172255011429
Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a severe complication after heart valve replacement.	0.6478838578938035
Incidence ranges in literature between 0.1% and 2.3% (mean 0.4%) per patient year (pty).	0.8494849313188503
PVE is classified as "early" or "late" (occurence within or after 60 days following heart valve replacement).	0.5890605230939859
In this review we present the clinical outcome of PVE as well as the most common diagnostic criteria (Duke criteria), the potential etiologies and the most frequent bacteria.	0.914595504248396
The spectrum of therapeutical alternatives is discussed and a special attention is directed to the development of prevention standards.	0.5494755688211324
Recently intra-atrial defibrillation has become an interesting alternative to external defibrillation and drug therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.	0.5758163198985291
Low-energy intra-atrial defibrillation can be used to restore sinus rhtyhm f.ex.	0.6290241911736644
after a failed external cardioversion or during an electrophysiologic study when the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided.	0.4560294944198243
Additionally this new technique has led to the development of implantable atrial defibrillators for the treatment of selected patients suffering from chronic atrial fibrillation.	0.5510239161034002
Intra-atrial defibrillation seems to be a highly effective and safe method, but little experience exists concerning the outcome so far.	0.696854642154592
Especially the potential risk of inducing ventricular proarrhythmia is subject of current controversy.	0.39256480668244703
Modern imaging techniques are a substantial part of treatment planning for minimally invasive radiotherapeutic procedures.	0.5421404040958699
The aim is three-dimensional assessment of the target volume and adjacent critical structures.	0.7043879270245368
In this paper, we report on our clinical experience with a precise system for stereotactic image correlation.	0.8111925248781201
Hereby, the advantages of each imaging modality can be combined.	0.6394722838658067
Precise immobilization of the patient is a prerequisite.	1.0322259261388487
The immobilization method has an accuracy of less than 1 mm.	0.4917069332380923
This method was evaluated in a clinical study in which a tumor control rate of 93 % was achieved in patients with brain metastases after stereotactic single high dose radiotherapy.	0.8525754970583862
This indicated the excellent reliability of this treatment planning method.	0.4801479170457412
The integration of functional image information, such as blood flow or activation of cerebral cortical areas, will be evaluated in the future.	0.5861663418873729
Olfactory dysfunction seems to be one of the most frequent symptoms in idiopathic parkinsonian syndrome (IPS).	0.5625305337228612
In contrast to the increasing number of studies providing evidence of the usefulness of olfactory tests in the diagnosis of IPS, clinical assessment of olfactory function is rarely performed.	0.6380356418675452
This may be due to the lack of an easy-to-use,  inexpensive, standardized, and reliable test.	0.7220079706698899
In this study, we administered the newly developed "sniffin' sticks" test to a group of 40 nondemented IPS patients and compared the results with 40 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and smoking habits.	0.6705327394283396
In all three subtests including odor identification, odor detection threshold, and odor discrimination, the control group scored significantly better than the IPS group, yielding a specificity and sensitivity of 90% each.	0.6311416484152426
Our results indicate that olfactory disturbances in IPS can be found at early stages of the disease, appear bilaterally, and do not correlate with the dominant side of parkinsonism.	0.6349931413095345
Therefore, we emphasize that olfactory testing may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of IPS.	0.8600555496187139
Purpose: The goal of this exemplary study was to integrate morphological and functional MRI to establish computer-based, preoperative therapy planning for tumors, instancing cervical carcinoma.	0.6324485153363828
Drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a rare but frequently lethal disease of the skin and mucosa of unknown etiology.	0.8438813100587638
Toxic metabolic and immunologic products in the serum have been discussed as possible causes.	0.474733979963908
For this reason we have performed plasmapheresis on these patients for many years.	0.652880966479948
Results regarding survival and healing of the lesions are quite favorable, as exemplified with two patients described here who benefited from the procedure despite their old age.	0.6179755681300347
In order to gain insight into possible disease mechanisms that would explain the beneficial effect of plasmapheresis, we did immunohistochemical studies on these patients before and in one case after the procedure.	0.678779184579642
In dermis and epidermis, there was a striking increase of macrophages and a relative increase of CD8-positive lymphocytes which might act as cytotoxic effector cells; these findings can be interpreted as the result of an immunological reaction.	0.6387217593747058
An increased staining of lesional epidermis with TNF, as previously noted by other autors, should be interpreted with caution since necrotic cells are involved.	0.5029930034798025
On the basis of the clinical results, the pathogenetic considerations, and in view of the lack of specific treatment modalities, clinical studies concerning plasmapheresis for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis are recommended, particularly since this procedure is widely available and generally well tolerated.	0.82393374643587
The majority of inflammatory frontal sinus diseases requiring operative intervention can now be managed successfully by endonasal surgery.	0.4904596212985794
In problematic cases, however, optimal exposure of the entire frontal sinus and possibly complete mucous membrane removal combined with sinus obliteration must be achieved.	0.47014463347848284
In these cases, external frontal sinus surgery is indicated.	0.6339151666349524
Impaction of an intramedullary nail during extraction is an unpredictable and delicate situation.	0.3154728353734508
Its problematic nature is unfolded on a report of two cases, one with a Küntscher nail and one with a modern solid titanium nail.	0.5704402959683779
This event is caused by ingrowth of new bone formation into the slot or the dorsal flute respectively.	0.46877108133915846
The new bone formation is a mechanical barrier which effectively forces the distal part of the nail to jam against the cortex.	0.5192586216376033
Both, the slot of the unlocked reamed clover leaf nail and the wider dorsal flute of the solid titanium nail, realize certain therapeutic concepts.	0.43126955989116433
Their factual benefit within the concept of interlocking nailing is doubtful.	0.29277478027174986
Primary intracranial germ cell tumors are rare neurological diseases.	0.4410217485707233
Secreting germ cell tumors that predominantly appear in the pineal region are characterized by elevated levels of -HCG and AFP in CSF.	0.5073010284375054
Adequate diagnostic and therapeutic regimens of these tumors are still under debate.	0.6712845249020298
We present the case of a patient suffering from spinal metastasis of a secreting germ cell tumor with raised levels of -HCG in CSF.	0.6245231130256612
Six years before, a pineocytoma of intermediate differentiation had been diagnosed by stereotaxic biopsy.	0.5410249904975889
This demonstrates the importance of an early detection of a germ cell neoplasm in case of midline-sized brain-tumors by evaluation of -HCG and AFP in CSF and serum.	0.6347161096566426
Today, different therapeutic strategies depending on the histological diagnosis are available and justify a high priority of a surgical tumor biopsy.	0.6761301416521013
However, the value of stereotaxic procedures remains controversial.	0.5204307159753038
Recently published data gave evidence of a definite improved prognosis of secreting CNS germ cell tumors following combined treatment with high-dose polychemotherapy, surgical resection and radiation of the tumor area.	0.7577576958919131
-HCG and AFP may serve as useful markers to enable follow-up of the disease.	0.5685595808182183
In order to get a better data management of complications in orthopedic surgery and in order to get comparable statistics a standardisation of nomenclature and classification of complications is demanded since 1.1.1997.	0.6269443298569204
The Orthopedic University Clinic of Heidelberg started with a register of all early complications of all inpatients.	0.43068136399140733

With the availability of modern imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), diagnostic options in the evaluation of Marfan patients have been improved profoundly.	0.5396291315855737
The most recent diagnostic advances comprise noninvasive tissue characterization of the aortic wall, immunofluorescence studies or pulse chase analyses of skin and cultured dermal fibroblasts, and molecular analysis at the cDNA/DNA level of the fibrillin-1 gene.	0.5954280496883889
New diagnostic insights have eventually led to revised nosologic criteria for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.	0.4031062328036549
The diagnostic reliability as well as the advantage and limitation of these recent diagnostic strategies are discussed: moreover diagnostic concepts for patients with neonatal as well as classic Marfan syndrome are presented and discussed in the context of the clinical management during adolescence, gravidity as well as in the pre- and postoperative patient.	0.711711374924544
Primary defects of skeletal growth and development can be subdivided into hypoplasias, dysostoses and dysplasias.	0.35553317943194096
Hypoplastic bones are small but otherwise normal.	0.23284064863922488
Generalized skeletal hypoplasias comprise various forms of primordial dwarfism and syndromal disorders including trisomy 21 and Ullrich-Turner syndrome.	0.2568979913878333
Dysostoses are defects of bones as organs resulting from errors of morphogenesis.	0.31194644788522835

Dysplasias are defects of bone as tissue.	0.29561450529341093
Some of them (e. g. achondroplasia, Jansen type of metaphyseal chondrodysplasia) are caused by defects of signal genes influencing cell division or differentiation.	0.5087632588073573
Others result from gene mutations affecting the cellular production of matrix components.	0.32448320667529446
Examples are collagenopathies such as osteogenesis imperfecta and some spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias.	0.251240255376918

In absence of significant symptoms and signs, the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) remains difficult.	0.6741266701171708
Sensitivity and specifity of laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and ECG on their own is low.	0.6305406754831002
Echocardiography is particularly useful in critically ill patients suspected of having pulmonary emboli and can help identify right ventricular pressure overload.	0.5232181500773214
Venous ultrasonography is useful in patients with suspected PE, but normal results do not rule out PE.	0.6217490610006788
Helical CT with contrast medium can identify pulmonary emboli.	0.333793227594653
However, if the CT findings are normal in the presence of a high index of clinical suspicion, only larger pulmonary embolism are ruled out, and angiography with the focus on distal pulmonary vasculature should be performed.	0.7239367088875144
The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism should be made by combining clinical assessment, several diagnostic techniques, and finally pulmonary angiography in doubtful cases.	0.7498509211562578

Pridie introduced the principle of drilling exposed subchondral bone with the objective of encouraging a fibro-cartilaginous repair.	0.4103439190708634
The newly formed fibrocartilaginous layer that develops over the lesion in osteoarthritis may be enough to decrease patients symptoms.	0.41795190550545025
Bone drilling into the subchondral layer is also effective in promoting healing of osteochondrosis dissecans.	0.4188821643545468
The choice of the treatment should be based on factors such as age of the patient, serverity of symptoms, activity level and functional demands on the joint, site and stage of the lesion.	0.7199557321101622
The drilling operation remains useful in osteoathritis and osteochondrosis dissecans.	0.23578424468728487
Recent immunobiological findings together with advances in biotechnology, ameliorations in clinical trial design, and MRI developments have led to a variety of therapeutical approaches in multiple sclerosis (MS).	0.47523201272218235
However, in contrast to successfully introduced new treatments, a number of therapeutical failures exist as well: despite impressive data from animal models, convincing concepts, and promising phase I/II studies, some investigated drugs and strategies showed no positive effects in clinical trials, or trials had to be terminated because of unexpected side effects.	0.6493498627370027

Isolated pancreatic metastases from renal-cell carcinomas (RCC) are extremely rare.	0.53126297299511
Only 96 cases of clinically diagnosed renal-cell carcinoma metastatic to the pancreas have been reported in the world literature, and 70 of the patients (including ours) underwent a definitive surgical resection.	0.7901804075473395
In many cases the time between the nephrectomy and diagnosis of metachronous metastases is reported to exceed 10 years.	0.6067142991558381
Therefore, the initial diagnosis may be overlooked when there is a prolonged disease-free interval.	0.8368247900422108
When it does occur simultaneously or metachronously, aggressive surgical resection, when possible, seems to be the most effective treatment for this metastatic lesion.	0.7184641921008524
Surgical resection can provide long-term survival in selected cases.	0.6045142146666467
We present the case of a 69-year-old woman in whom two pancreatic metastases were treated by a left-sided subtotal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, 12 years after radical nephrectomy for a RCC.	0.6795168036099495
The patient simultaneously presented with both a mass in the body of the pancreas and a right-sided colon cancer.	0.6097573364563363
Thus, the diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis of colon cancer was suspected initially.	0.6927807787893945
Both tumors were radically resected, and histological examination revealed two pancreatic metastases from the previous RCC.	0.712426699129982
In the world literature this report represents the eighth case of multiple pancreatic metastases due to RCC.	0.47837058605379046
It illustrates a rare indication of pancreatic resection because of pancreatic metastasis.	0.4121343367236249

Delusion is understood to mean intersubjectively disconcerting convictions with a tendency toward subjective certainty that lose their disconcerting character when made the object of psychiatric analysis in the knowledge of their independence from mental disorder.	0.4104320318542695
The perceptions from which delusions arise are dynamically charged according to their role in the structural context.	0.4627503237345513
The realisation pressure that burdens the perceptions and is intensified in psychotic constitutions is a precondition for the delusion.	0.2931654049474966
The failure of derealisation brought about by the psychotic disorganisation of the structure is also a requirement.	0.544084896836337
Based on a case study, considerations arising out of the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions for chronification.	0.7272507881862843
High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) is a promising treatment for patients with germ cell tumours and a poor prognosis.	0.7890788921549929
The selection of patients who may profit from this intervention is challenging for the urologist, as the indication has to be carefully established.	0.7721612830158722
Exclusion criteria primarily concern impaired organ functions.	0.17568925203490743
Prior to HDCT haematopoietic stem cells are obtained after the administration of conventional-dose chemotherapy plus G- or GM-CSF stimulation.	0.5647776803430499
HDCT consists of a combination of carboplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide.	0.35527033624379334
After HDCT, haematologic monitoring and maximal supportive care are essential.	0.2800446100933
It is therefore recommended that HDCT only be administered at specialized centres.	0.4171408136742994
Pyoderma gangrenosum develops in most patients between the age of 25 and 54 years.	0.584819362034159
It usually occurs in otherwise healthy persons or in association with a systemic desease.	0.5051996955240242
Several clinical variants of pyoderma gangrenosum have been described.	0.4257561004934898
Extremely painful ulcerations are characteristic and evolve rapidly.	0.26627059653832297
Malignant pyoderma, the variant described in our case report, is an aggressive variant of ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum, rapidly progressive and a potentially lethal ulcerative disease.	0.6670593892762291
The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum depends on recognition of the evolving clinical features because histopathologic changes are not specific and characteristically serological or hematological markers of the disease do not exist.	0.5973643597502287
Histopathologic findings, however, always include vasculitis, either in form of the necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis (7), granulomatous (1) or lymphocytic vasculitis (2).	0.6312436319477749
We report on a 36-year-old male patient, who underwent surgery for repair of an aneurysm of the aortic arch.	0.8800481953551738
The aneurysm occurred two months after exacerbation of a malignant variant of pyoderma gangrenosum with nearly lethal exit.	0.5711417968866039
An association of pyoderma gangrenosum with vasculitis has been described previously, but the present report is the first to describe an aortic arch aneurysm which seems to be associated with necrotizing angiitis of the vasa vasorum caused by a pyoderma gangrenosum.	0.7357392964881573
We could demonstrate successful perioperative treatment for prevention of exacerbation of pyoderma gangrenosum with prednisone and clofazimine	0.4519835882522271
Background and purpose: To test the association of cardiac sources of embolism with territorial type brain infarcts.	0.5265962298572753
Defects of the dorsal and ventral ligament complexes of the lumbar spine results to an instability of the functional spinal unit.	0.592983164480266
For the prognosis of secondary instability due to disko-ligamentous injuries the functional insufficiency of the lasting scars is a larger problem than the primar loss of osseous stability with fast healing tendency.	0.4641720250838296
The main goal of the present biomechanical study in vitro was to demonstrate the different grades of instability in the correlation to progressive disko-ligamentous defects as well as stabilisation through dynamic and static procedures.	0.5930468714519775
With a transpedicular screw-ringband-system the segmental function was preserved and instability was abolished.	0.36736812124139884

The stereotactic aspiration and drainage of an intracerebral abscess provides accurate localization and minimal cortical damage and offers the possibility of intracavitary application of antibiotics.	0.47233348447671386
The stereotactic internal shunt implantation seems to be an alternative approach in the treatment of diencephalic cysts due to its minimal invasiveness and low operative risk.	0.610397606124432
The aspiration of basal ganglia haematomas with insertion of an external drainage allows the lysis of the haematoma with r-tPA or urokinase.	0.3911963004301757

Radiotherapy of patients with prostate cancer offers an alternative to radical prostatectomy in early stages (T1-T2).	0.6631106466350202
In locally advanced prostate cancer a high dose or combined radiotherapy is more effective than radical surgery with concurrent lower morbidity and mortality.	0.5159844211247216
Recent developments in linear accellerator technique, the progress in dose calculation and planning techniques provide the means to apply higher doses to a given tumor volume while effectively protecting the surrounding normal tissue at the same time.	0.5021908530540993
These improvements may possibly reduce the rate of therapy related side effects or complications significantly.	0.3735248028311186
The combination of external beam radiotherapy and interstitial brachytherapy as well as the combination of hormone therapy and external beam radiotherapy are most likely more effective than percutaneous irradiation alone.	0.586202345632002
In special cases with a very low risk of recurrent tumor an interstitial permanent brachytherapy alone is indicated.	0.7565410760726112
Future developments (i. e. intensity modulated radiotherapy - IMRT, combined thermo-radiotherapy, proton- or neutrontherapy) may further increase the rate of curative treatments in patients with prostate cancer.	0.655755790791526
Skin is the second most common site of extranodal lymphoma.	0.3652289826797863
The significance of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas has been underestimated due to the lack of monoclonal antibodies and molecular genetics in former years.	0.5438415522090583
Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas represent a heterogenous group of entities which show variation in histology, immunophenotype and in prognosis.	0.4435379752608374
The most common entities presenting in skin are follicular lymphomas, marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.	0.614129619669683
The majority of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas have an excellent prognosis.	0.6039716066602053
Whereas in B-cell lymphomas with secondary spread to the skin the clinical course is dependant on the prognosis of the primary lymphoma.	0.790926154014282
It is evident that primary cutaneous lymphomas are distinct from nodal lymphomas and not extranodal manifestations of their lymph-node-based counterparts.	0.4533302117885555
In the current review the morphologic spectrum of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas comprising primary and secondary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas is discussed according to the WHO classification sheme.	0.6757173477894654
The phencyclidine derivative ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with the thalamo-neocortical projection system as the primary site of action.	0.44300699370456154
Racemic ketamine consists of the enantiomers S(+)-ketamine and R(-)-ketamine.	0.7065977594824416
Racemic ketamine has never been considered an adequate anaesthetic agent in neurosurgical patients since  it produces regionally specific stimulation of cerebral metabolism (CMRO2) and increases cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP).	0.5094907075349691
However, recent experiments suggest that both tracemic ketamine and S(+)-ketamine may reduce infarct size in animal models of incomplete cerebral ischaemia and brain injury.	0.5892375876791582
This experimental protective effect appears to be related to decreases in Ca++ influx and maintenance of brain tissue magnesium levels due to NMDA and quisqualate receptor blockade by ketamine.	0.3670508548835645
Studies in dogs have shown that racemic ketamine (2.0 mg/kg) increases CBF in the presence of the cerebral vasodilator N2O.	0.6266002424009259
In contrast, studies in rats without background anaesthesia showed increases in CBF after racemic ketamine (100 mg/kg i.p.).	0.5863478409744179
This suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre-existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics.	0.40269120805684366
Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity was maintained regardless of the baseline cerebrovascular resistance.	0.3650708899824098
There are several mechanisms by which racemic ketamine may increase CBF.	0.46370204167622475
It induces dose-dependent respiratory depression with consequent mild hypercapnia in spontaneously ventilating subjects.	0.3796068408251202
This produces vasodilation due to the intact cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity.	0.4078078075339517
Racemic ketamine also induces regional neuroexcitation, which leads to stimulation of cerebral glucose consumption in the limbic, extrapyramidal, auditory, and sensory-motor systems.	0.5763547361555825
This regional neuroexcitation with increased CMRO2 produces increases in CBF that can be blocked by infusion of barbiturates or benzodiazepines.	0.4260401943010542
However, increases in CBF with racemic ketamine (1 mg/kg) may also occur during normocapnia and without changes in CMRO2.	0.8235531114148243
This effect is related to some additional direct cerebral vasodilating potency of racemic ketamine based on a mechanism involving blockade of Ca++ channels.	0.4921333616335455
The effects of racemic ketamine on CBF autoregulation have not been investigated systematically.	0.5506805054005642
However, studies in rats have shown that CBF autoregulation was maintained with low- and high-dose S(+)-ketamine.	0.8219993602038164
Infusion of racemic ketamine alters intracranial volume and ICP.	0.4050562485492515
Studies in spontaneously ventilating pigs with and without intracranial hypertension have shown that racemic ketamine (0.5-5.0 mg/kg) produces increases in PaCO2 and ICP.	0.6490770621191815
In contrast, identical experiments with mechanical ventilation and controlled PaCO2 showed no changes in ICP following racemic ketamine infusion.	0.42518141879218324
This implies that increases in ICP are related to inadequate ventilation with consecutive hypercapnia and increases in intracranial blood volume.	0.41797279006282423
However, mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to control ICP following racemic ketamine.	0.5926690077396047
Experiments in mechanically ventilated dogs indicate that racemic ketamine (2 mg/kg) increases cerebral blood volume and ICP even in the presence of normoventilation, a response that is reversible by hyperventilation or the administration of diazepam.	0.6415850005265727
Studies in patients have shown that racemic ketamine (2.0 mg/kg) reduces CBF in the presence of cerebral vasodilators like halothane or N2O.	0.56656375784912
In contrast, studies in unanaesthetised humans showed increases in CBF after racemic ketamine (2-3 mg/kg).	0.6067576992376368
This observation is consistent with animal studies and suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre-existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics.	0.41030285209909595
Dengue-Fever is a mosquito transmitted viral disease.	0.20468462111235547

Multiple factors may cause tear film instability.	0.3152998320940327
Measuring the break-up time of the preocular tear film is a necessary, clinically reliable means for evaluating tear film stability.	0.5765384337635672
We designed a new instrument to observe the preocular tear film at high magnification which can contribute to the in vivo imaging of the physiological and pathophysiological dynamics of the tear film and its break-up phenomena.	0.55181510428613
The prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV infections among drug abuse-related fatalities in Hamburg (1985-1997) was investigated with respect to epidemiological, forensic and morphological aspects.	0.6477025974485298
The purpose of this study was (1) to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV infections among drug abuse-related fatalities (drug deaths) in Hamburg from 1985 to 1997, (2) to assess the rate of multiple infections and (3) to analyze the liver histomorphology in 100 autopsied drug deaths.	0.7332751650999444
Furthermore, we discuss the epidemiological and forensic aspects.	0.814880494951458
In this period 1469 drug deaths were registered with a prevalence for HBV of 35% (1997: 39%), for HCV 51% (1997: 58%), and for HIV 7% (1997: 15%).	0.6789849603342785
Co-infections were common (28%) and 19% of all cases were infected with HBV and HCV.	0.8553591863619059
The liver histology showed that hepatitis was frequently diagnosed (74%) and was associated with HBV and/or HCV infections (77% of all hepatitis cases).	0.7216089650577947
Only 9% showed a normal liverhistology.	0.8178404585030093
Forensic autopsies and monitoring of HBV, HCV and HIV infections in drug deaths represent an important tool to gain information about the individual case and the situation among i.v.	0.5939037007747002
Background: An abnormal coronary flow reserve represents an early marker of impaired blood flow regulation in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis under the impact of risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia.	0.6480352021207665
Our clinical investigation was aimed at assessing noninvasively the integrative coronary flow response to dipyridamole stress in 18 consecutive patients with microvascular angina, only moderately elevated LDL-cholesterol levels (168 +/- 33 mg/dl), and reduced vasodilator capacity despite normal (n=9) or slightly abnormal (n=9) coronary arteriograms (minimal disease with luminal irregularities and/or diameter reduction <=30%) before and after 6-month lipid-lowering therapy (simvastatin).	0.5768050977014565
Methods: Regional and averaged myocardial blood flow were measured at rest and after dipyridamole induced vasodilation (0.56 mg/kg) using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and N-13 ammonia as flow tracer related to a 3-compartment kinetic model.	0.5978710479583256
Baseline data (mean +/- SD): 13 males, 5 females; mean age: 56 +/- 8 years; basal coronary flow: 90 +/- 22 ml/minx100 g; after lipid intervention: 93 +/- 18 ml/minx100 g (n.s.).	0.6739035185456567
Total cholesterol decreased to 170 +/- 36 mg/dl (p<0.001); mean LDL level: 97 +/- 26 mg/dl (p<0.001).	0.5279600069877725
Coronary dilator capacity increased, assessed in terms of minimal coronary resistance: 0.38 +/- 0.08 vs 0.49 +/- 0.09 units at baseline (p<0.01), myocardial blood flow under dipyridamole: 232 +/- 43 vs 186 +/- 37 ml/minx100 g at baseline (p<0.01), and instantaneous flow ratio: 2.6 +/- 0.7 vs 2.2 +/- 0.6 (p=0.06).	0.5873295763406766
Concomitantly, a considerable regression of angina was noticed in the majority of patients.	0.5917350758415549
Conclusions: An improvement of the non-invasively determined integrative dipyridamole induced coronary vasodilator capacity may be achieved after 6 months by intensive lipid lowering at a very early stage of coronary atherosclerosis.	0.6068883759191527
Consequently, aggressive cholesterol-lowering therapy represents an antiischemic and antianginal approach suggesting, at least in part, functional reversal and probably prevention of further disease progression.	0.5417611864548935
We report the case of a a 60 year-old worker in the pharmaceutical industry who suffered from recurring contact dermatitis.	0.5212582527817639
Initially the contact dermatitis was limited to the hands; later on it became generalized.	0.5091160949790771
The patient had been working on a drug filling line in a pharmaceutical plant for more than 20 years.	0.5841003688656992
Eight years after starting this job he had developed allergic hand dermatitis to 2,6-diaminopyridine (patch test positive); this healed upon cessation of exposure.	0.42064526665123053
Ten years later he again developed hand dermatitis which progressed to generalized dermatitis and conjunctivitis.	0.3586021495740277
Under systemic and local therapy with corticosteroids and cessation of work, it healed nearly completly.	0.5704344242418785
Four months after returning to work, the patient experienced a first episode of severe asthma and generalized dermatitis with conjunctivitis following exposure to hydroxychloroquine the day before.	0.6138213454883352
The asthma and dermatitis improved after systemic corticosteroid therapy and stopping work.	0.2866568018818797
His condition continued to fluctuate, when though the patient was transferred at work and now wore rubber gloves.	0.5767961393245802
Eight months later he again developed a generalized dermatitis.	0.4001647708997435
Patch testing revealed delayed-type sensitizations to hydroxychloroquine (tested in concentrations of 0.1%, 0.5%, 1% and 2%).	0.708504140310182
Equivalent tests in five healthy volunteers were negative.	0.28766576416921474
The patch test reactions were pustular, while a biopsy was interpreted as a multiform contact dermatitis reaction.	0.5534963853962213
Bronchial exposure with hydroxychloroquine dust produced a delayed bronchial obstruction over the next 20 hours, which progressed to fever and generalized erythema (hematogenous contact dermatitis).	0.4979677000298228
After removing exposure to 2,6-diaminopyridine and hydroxychloroquine, the patient went on to develop a contact dermatitis to latex (patch test positive).	0.6114155047673614
However, skin prick tests with latex and patch tests with rubber additiva were negative.	0.4483127219508953
Hydroxychloroquine is well known to cause drug reactions.	0.5880971470854437
To our knowledge, contact dermatitis to this substance has not yet been reported.	0.49345131932036085
It is noteworthy that the patch test reactions were pustular and of multiform morphology and that bronchial exposure to the allergen resulted in asthma and a generalized drug reaction.	0.455939787532651
Pathogenetically the asthmatic reaction seems to be on a delayed-type mechanism as is also seen with ampicillin, cobalt and nickel induced asthma.	0.4581183274586059
A 45 years old female runner developed a bilateral tendinopathy of the Achilles tendon after repeated antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin.	0.4223980373307664
One month later the right Achilles tendon ruptured without any sudden pain.	0.3365344428383272
MRI revealed degenerative changes of the left Achilles tendon; on the right side the tendon was ruptured with a dehiscence of 4 cm between both ends of the tendon.	0.7505109415557124
The tendon was reconstructed surgically.	0.3787300282524469
The histological analysis showed cystic changes with focal necrosis.	0.3577096718049508
This finding differ from findings in non drug induced tendinopathies.	0.32280758778282553
After antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin the side effect of a tendon disorder must be considered.	0.5373337403419524
The impairment of the tendon may be as strong that a tendon rupture may occur at daily living activities without any typical clinical symptoms.	0.5761890912224263
The recent results obtained from investigations based on molecular biological techniques have led to a better understanding of recurrent genetic causes important for the pathogenesis of tumors.	0.5658978532543556
Several genes have been identified as being involved in the development of cancer.	0.6100438992102247
In many cases, the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes is the predominant reason for cancerogenic cell transformation.	0.6066424506948439
Functional dysregulation is frequently the consequence of mutations, resulting in an alteration of the primary structure of the DNA.	0.6356976598081722
As our understanding of the nature, function, and interaction of these genes evolves, new opportunities for early diagnosis, classification, prevention, and treatment of malignant tumors will arise.	0.8105098265943915
The present report summarizes the current molecular biological aspects of several oncogenes (erbB, ras, myc, raf, fos, jun, bcl, mdm 2, myb, kit CSF1R, met) and tumor suppressor genes (p 53, rb, mts) involved in lung-cancer development with respect to the pathology of lung tumors, including the importance of these genes as far as the clinical course of the disease is concerned.	0.6962692647869877
Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) therapy is a kind of medical treatment in which a patient breathes 100% of oxygen inside a pressure chamber while the pressure of the chamber is increased to a point higher than sea level pressure.	0.7065876689063417
It is strongly based on clearly defined physical laws and physiological regularities.	0.3215440688951751
For the clinical use of HBO therapy, according to international recommendations, there are several commonly accepted indications in which HBO either is the only causative life-saving kind of treatment, or is an essential and oftenly decisive component of a comprehensive interdisciplinary intensive care therapy.	0.6822655326604179
Among potential adverse effects, barotrauma of the lungs and especially oxygen toxicity to the central nervous system have to be mentioned.	0.5460469832364591
Clinical use of HBO therefore requires special knowledge of its effects, risks, and adverse effects, a clear and distinct indication, and the ability and skills to keep complications under control by means of intensive care or emergency medical measures.	0.6821143665079626
The clinical use of hyperbaric oxygen with its interdisciplinary-like character of emergency medicine or intensive care therapy therefore should be an additional, most interesting field of activity for the anaesthesiologist.	0.6546363516144394
Although arthroscopy of the ankle joint has been well established, there are only very few reports about arthroscopy in ankle fracture treatment.	0.7133866268546565
In order to sytematically analyze the intraarticular lesions of ankle fractures, we assessed 196 consecutive ankle fractures immediately before ORIF.	0.5332243947385986
There were 94 male and 101 female patients with an average age of 47.8 years (16-88 years).	0.7006118911015362
There were more cartilage lesions found than expected, and cartilage lesions were not noted more frequently in type C-fractures than in type B-fractures.	0.694390211278182
In both fracture types, an increasing amount of cartilage lesions was found from group 1 to 3.	0.6361470719604713
In addition, more ligament injuries were found than expected, especially in the B.1- and B.2-fractures.	0.8706388477276672
Successful arthroscopic surgery was performed in 26 cases: internal fixation, 9; loose body removal, 7; ligament reposition, 5; cartilage smoothening, 4; and cartilage fracture repair, 1.	0.6792795403357605
In one case, a periostal flap could not be reduced, and in another case, the internal fixation of the medial malleolus was not stable.	0.9429022283951339
In summary, arthroscopy was shown to be a very helpful diagnostic tool in ankle fractures.	0.7856054894121313
As long-term results are not yet available, it remains, however, unclear as to whether arthroscopy may improve the success of the following ORIF.	0.9287924301804064
Arthroscopy was also shown to be a successful tool for several closed surgical procedures.	0.5852914176130007
Of these, percutaneous internal fixation of the medial malleolus under arthroscopic view may be an excellent indication.	0.8123840179119775
Objective: Transcultural adaption of the two most widely used and accepted functional indices in ankylosing spondylitis, the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) and Dougados Functional Index (D-FI).	0.604261653721532
Methods: The instruments were translated and tested for internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient alpha), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC), construct validity (testing for association with Schober's test, finger floor distance, occiput wall distance, frequency and duration of awakenings at night, and a visual analog scale pain), and responsiveness (standardized response mean, SRM).	0.5179891746005773
Results: The study sample consisted of 72 patients of a randomized, controlled clinical trial receiving either Diclofenac or placebo.	0.6762973208523894
Visual assessment of distribution patterns revealed a ceiling effect of both instruments.	0.3700422636624791
Both questionnaires had a high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha: 0.81 [BASFI], 0.85 [D-FI] and a high test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.92 [BASFI], 0.89 [D-FI]).	0.5575899533215755
The limited responsiveness to Diclofenac treatment (SRM: 0.46 [BASFI],  0.33 [D-FI]) may be related to the selected study sample.	0.6336413767713123
The BASFI was significantly correlated with all tested validation parameters.	0.3434479350820959
The  D-FI was only significantly correlated with finger floor distance, occiput wall distance, and duration of awakenings at night.	0.482726268334531
Conclusion: The transculturally adapted version of both functional indices are valid, reliable, and internally consistent.	0.5746100306063541
Because of psychometric advantages, the BASFI may be preferred in clinical trial settings.	0.6090975700172324
The role of radiotherapy of the pelvic lymphatic pathways in patients with node positive prostate cancer remains uncertain.	0.608147673806637
Interpretation of the few prospective studies (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06) is hampered by severe flaws in the study design.	0.7068549740644128
Extension of the radiation to the paraaortal region shows no advantage over radiation of the pelvic lymphatics alone and is not warranted.	0.6338485294390838
Data on longterm side-effects are only available from older studies with outdated radiation techniques.	0.4873052687464579
According to more recent studies short term side effects are considerably higher with radiation of the pelvic lymphatics when compared with radiation of the prostate alone.	0.6851336573764564
In summary radiation of the lymphatic pathways in lymph node positive prostate cancer cannot currently be considered as standard treatment and should be carried out within clinical studies.	0.6084604955538209
In reconstruction of cartilage defects, autogenous transplantation is known as a reliable and experienced method.	0.5723415903122688
Although a clinical application has not been reported until now, tissue engineering permits in vitro production of autogenous cartilage transplants.	0.5698460978894804
Nevertheless, in both methods the cartilage is exposed to individually varying resorptive mechanisms.	0.6626702783674714
Among other methods for in vivo tissue protection, the encapsulation with a semipermeable polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could guarantee sufficient protection against resorptive influences.	0.5062682108523405
Human septal cartilage was encapsulated (group 1) with polyelectrolytecomplex membranes and subcutaneously implanted on the back of thymusaplastic nude mice.	0.5657225930790158
Cartilage implants without encapsulation (group 2) were used as control.	0.7581350337469471
Scanning electron microscopy and histochemical investigations were performed 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after implantation.	0.7385058777375906
Group 1 showed no signs of resorption and chronic inflammation at all.	0.45139985240598623
In contrast, group 2 presented, correlating to the time of implanta-tion, increasing signs of cell death and fibrotic transformation, representing an increased activity of resorption.	0.6270224036655598
In conclusion, tissue encapsulation with a polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could ensure a sufficient protection of human cartilage transplants from resorptive influences.	0.4696011340451268
For the plastic-reconstructive surgeon the desired result becomes more calculable.	0.39959107374890124
Subjective time-experience and objective time-estimation were examined in 20 endogenous, 20 neurotic depressives, and 15 healthy volunteers.	0.6871994188059252
Subjective experience of past and anticipated future time was more extended in both depressive groups than in healthy controls.	0.35543522613290945
Objective time estimation differed between depressives and controls concerning relatively long time spans whereas very short time spans were correctly estimated also by depressives.	0.35948007802400217
There were no significant differences between endogenous and neurotic depressives.	0.5671702246148431
The perception of extended time normalized during treatment.	0.2778336776954677
The depressives' time perception, differences correlated with the extent of depressive psychopathological symptoms and - to a lesser degree - with retardation.	0.7516726269912059
The findings support the hypotheses of anthropological phenomenology concerning disturbed time perception and estimation in depressives.	0.34133050997260916
Amelioration of experienced time-extension in intentionally structured time spans compared to empty time spans suggests psychotherapeutic consequences in the sense of Lewinsohn.	0.3092884894629811
We investigated whether the free-to-total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ratio (f-PSA/t-PSA ratio; i. e. percentage of free PSA) represents a better discriminator for the detection of cancer of the prostate (CaP).	0.5759126329962732
In a retrospective analysis, the persentage of free PSA was determined in the sera of 35 patients with histologically proven benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 35 patients with clinically localized CaP.	0.77726658200558
Patients with urolithiasis (n = 33) served as a control group.	0.4245452367775781
Serum levels of free PSA and total PSA were determined employing a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay.	0.45669788905203157
Patients with CaP demonstrated a lower percentage of free PSA (median: 8.7) than patients with BPH (median: 20.0; P < 0.001) and those with urolithiasis (median: 18.8; P < 0.001).	0.6907924668785287
Determination of the percentage of free PSA enhances the differentiation between BPH and CaP and may reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in patients with an elevated PSA.	0.6988312034571893
Confirmation of our preliminary results is required.	0.3172663730606505
Psychological problems in children and parents related to children's atopic eczema (AE) may impede the success of treatment.	0.6046037678335795
We studied the question, if behavior-based parental education in groups (DPE) or standardized video-education (VPE) could enhance dermatological treatment effects and reduce skin-damaging behaviors in children and stress in their mothers.	0.6075625669867619
Sevoflurane degrades in CO2 absorbents to produce compound A, which may have  hepatotoxic potential in humans.	0.6149817183896787
Several recent studies in human volunteers have been performed to evaluate this potential.	0.6133627264844713
Three studies have evaluated sevoflurane administered to volunteers using a 3% concentration for 8 h duration at approximately 2 L/min flow rate.	0.46623304557459827
The initial investigation found high excretion of protein, glucose and renal tubular enzymes in the urine of the volunteers receiving sevoflurane.	0.49975968452475333
Subsequent investigations using identical protocols found more minor or absent changes in excretion of these markers.	0.33006344002417953
One additional investigation in volunteers studied 3% sevoflurane anesthesia for 4 h duration using a low-flow (1 L/min) technique.	0.7432393109667331
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was observed.	0.3781566230308999
Application of these results to clinical practice must be interpreted in light of the experimental nature of the anesthetic administration.	0.7370582486370809
Although some controversy remains, these data, combined with results of recent studies in surgical patients, suggest that renal function following modest duration low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia is similar to that following isoflurane anesthesia.	0.7263872044295794
Background: The microbial colonization of the intestinal tract in newborns begins during delivery.	0.5428853567047426
Streptococci and Escherichia coli pave the way for the bifidobacterial dominance typical in breast-fed newborns.	0.37549380635933516
They provide optimal living conditions for anaerobic bifidobacteria by withdrawal of intraluminal oxygen.	0.25979404062508454
A mixed intestinal flora is established on infant formula feeding in the infant.	0.330428034714418
Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and lactobacilli are the main genera of this mixed intestinal flora.	0.43777482041430726
This represents an intermediate stage of the microflora in adults.	0.44151274054793005
The bifidogenic effect of mothers' milk is based on the active substances it contains, which selectively enhance the growth of bifidobacteria, whereas other active substances suppress the growth of the accompanying flora.	0.6830462860913699
Bifidus-enhancing factors in breast-feeding are lactose, oligosaccharides, glycoproteins such as glycomacropeptide and the inoculation with bifidobacteria deriving from the skin surface of the mother.	0.4847385955232212
Factors directed to the suppression of the accompanying microflora are antibodies, lactoferrin, lysozyme, fatty acids and monoglycerides that act as antimicrobial substances and the comparatively low protein and iron content in mothers' milk.	0.4077432506022543
A bifidus-inhibiting colonization of the intestinal tract with pathogenic germs is caused by maternal birth-canal infections, which are now known to be the most frequent reason for premature births.	0.7234519646160309
An increasing number of surgical deliveries, the separation of the newborn infant from its mother, and the generous use of antibiotics contribute to the delayed colonization of bifidobacteria and to the development of life-threatening nosocomial infections.	0.759882601601537
Counteractive measures against this disastrous situation are the preferential use of bifidobacteria-preserving antibiotics and the inoculation of lyophilized bifidobacteria.	0.3754373919519352
Between January 1983 and December 1987, metatarsal head-resections were performed on 203 patients, comprising a total of 370 feet, using the Hueter/Mayo and Hoffmann procedure.	0.543655287354922
Seventy-two patients, comprising a total of 126 feet, were available for post-operative review after an average of 11.4 years from the date of the original operations.	0.7690324519545808
The information obtained from standardized questionnaires was compared to the information found in each patient's file.	0.6225312765054511
In addition, every available pre- and post-operative x-ray taken from 1983 to 1987 was analyzed.	0.5444550443107722
Thus, with an average follow-up period of 5.6 years, the changes found in the pre- and post-operative x-rays from a total of 183 feet could be compared.	0.9097322980967303
Before the operations, nearly 100% of the examined feet suffered from painful synovial hypertrophy and erosion of the metatarsophalangeal joints with dislocation and subluxation, causing approximately 70% of all patients to have great difficulties in walking.	0.6307877017692812
After the operations, however, 90.2% of the patients reported that this condition had noticeably improved or had completely disappeared.	0.6802461020950122
In fact, 87.5% of all patients reported a lasting improvement in their ability to walk longer distances.	0.6824117013328276
As the main criteria in determining the success of an operation (namely, the noticeable reduction of pain and increased mobility) were achieved in 87.5% of the patients, we consider the metatarsal head-resection a reliable method of correcting forefoot deformities in rheumatoid arthritis.	0.8016228743899247
Bone metabolism is influenced by systemic and local acting hormons.	0.4224057276884004
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) as representatives of the latter substances are known to have the ability for ectopic bone formation.	0.6992949272018514
Within this study, we investigated the influence of different growth factors on the proliferation- and differentiation rate of osteoblast-like cells.	0.8006584362959086
For that purpose, human osteoblast-like cells (HPOC) were incubated in the presence of either recombinant BMP-4 of the genome of xenopus laevis (rxBMP-4), recombinant human BMP 2 (rhBMP-2), transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß) or basic fibroblast growth factor (rh-bFGF) in two different concentrations each (10 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml).	0.6474674967083338
Cell proliferation was measured within a MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromid] assay, the amount of cell differentiation by the activity of alcaline phosphatase.	0.8475893833258167
Rx-BMP-4 induced a differentiation of HPOC to almost the same extent as rhBMP-2, whereas the addition of rh-bFGF, applied at the same concentration, failed to have any influence on cell differentiation.	0.6209381001328503
However, rh-bFGF provoked an increase in cell proliferation when compared with unstimulated HPOC, while rhBMP-2 and rxBMP-4 showed no effect on proliferation.	0.6122360742318653
TGF-ß influenced bone proliferation as well as differenciation significantly.	0.36816536551540807
The equipotent effect of recombinant human BMP-2 and recombinant BMP-4 obtained from Xenopus laevis with regard to differentiation and proliferation of human primary osteoblast-like cells originates either in the fact that target cells have receptors for BMP 2 as well as BMP 4, or that both BMP's link to the same receptor with almost the same affinity.	0.5571090555807678
Sonography has provided an important addition to the tools available for the diagnosis of the soft tissues in the head and neck region.	0.7203590886759911
The ENT surgeon himself is able to examine pathological formations by this quick, non-invasive and, last but not least, less expensive method.	0.5456500407398387
Due to the high resolution of the procedure the chance of detecting even small changes is increased and the exactness of diagnosis of pathological lymph nodes of the neck has been significantly improved compared to palpation alone.	0.6741313215309643
Ultrasound has replaced the sialographic procedures in the field of diagnostic evaluation of salivary gland disease in the daily practice except for special indications.	0.6264003983596447
After inauguration of color Doppler sonography non-invasive evaluation of vascular stenosis of the large cervical vessels concerning their hemodynamic effects has become possible.	0.5141545320708749
This issue is important for the differential dignosis of otoneurological diseases such as sudden hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus.	0.46420739793934174
Additionally, the extent of perfusion of space-occupying lesions can be easily examined, and therefore the risk of mass bleeding can be preoperatively assessed by this method without harm to the patient.	0.6806025391010931
Especially carotid body tumors may be diagnosed with high accuracy by the evidence of significant diffuse perfusion of the lesion.	0.5703476701411349
In several studies the specificity of the assessment of cervical lymph node disease could be increased by examination of resistance indices.	0.6890729465736243
However, other authors have shown inconsistent results in differentiation of benign and malignant lumps; therefore, final judgment does not seem to be possible yet.	0.5857730716635849
Use of echo-contrast agents to enhance the ultrasound signal seems to be a promising approach for future developments in color Doppler imaging.	0.6076772163023836
Painful stiffness of the shoulder is an ill-defined clinical entity that is difficult to assess and delicate to treat.	0.5839886382426213
The nomenclature used is broad and includes terms such as frozen shoulder, adhesive capsulitis, focal algodystrophy, stiff shoulder, contracted shoulder, and others.	0.4556451681733006
Apart from its idiopathic form, the disease can be initiated by trauma, infection, tumour, radiation, systemic and local metabolic disturbances.	0.7529417731504019
Pathoanatomically, the common denominator is an inflammatory vascular proliferation followed by thickening, scarring, and retraction of the joint capsule.	0.5904948598534269
The inflammatory process often starts at the rotator interval and may extend to the subacromial space.	0.41643145720272134
The prognosis for patients in whom metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is not treated is unfavorable, with a reported 5-year survival of 0-18 %.	0.847456962985578
Before the era of immunotherapy and in the absence of effective nonsurgical therapy, resection of metastases was the accepted way to prolong survival, giving a 5-year survival of 7-69 %.	0.676247123176951
Retrospective studies have shown that several clinical factors are associated with a relatively good prognosis.	0.6027541916690574
Some patients will benefit from resection of metastases, but most patients with metastatic RCC are not candidates for such aggressive surgery.	0.6137379860016545
The use of interleukin-2 has demonstrated that immunotherapy can produce durable remissions.	0.45604642037791154
Without randomized trials, it is difficult to know whether survival is longer than that in untreated patients, but there is clear evidence that immunotherapy improves survival and yields long-lasting remissions in selected patients.	0.6830242297184932
Many questions remain concerning quality of life and the benefit-to-risk ratio of immunotherapy, but it is the most effective treatment for metastatic RCC.	0.8351051734505304

Shoulder fusion is especially suited if the function of elbow and hand is well preserved and if the patient is physically active.	0.6331065360606578
But fusion is definite and the options of muscle transfer operations and above elbow amputation have to be considered.	0.46937731107137176
The unreamed femoral nail (UFN) system, with its numerous proximal interlocking options, allows a minimal invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of nearly all femoral fracture patterns.	0.6595186248328144
Sixty-six fractures, 5 cases of osteolysis or pathologic fractures, 2 limb shortenings and 1 lengthening (monorail technique) and 3 cases of pseudarthrosis were stabilised with the UFN from July 1994 to December 1996.	0.6781622986630338
The fractures were analysed according to the AO classification.	0.5739792526736099
We found 31 polytrauma patients with an mean ISS of 21.8 and a mean PTS of 25.4.	0.6606010103844574
Most of the multiply injured patients (n = 26) were stabilised with the UFN primarily.	0.6161729695402881
Follow-up of 44 patients ranged from 4 to 18 months postoperatively.	0.6604979752947123
According to our clinical and radiological score the results were excellent in 34 % of cases, good in 36.3 %, poor in 20.4 % and bad in 9 %.	0.832167003171832
Average fracture healing time was about 9.8 weeks.	0.5542155440651074
Fractures of the atlas account for 1-2 % of all vertebral fractures.	0.8978957058014381
We divide atlas fractures into 5 groups: isolated fractures of the anterior arch of the atlas, isolated fractures of the posterior arch, combined fractures of the anterior and posterior arch (so-called Jefferson fractures), isolated fractures of the lateral mass and fractures of the transverse process.	0.7040863648152751
Isolated fractures of the anterior or posterior arch are benign and are treated conservatively with a soft collar until the neck pain has disappeared.	0.6691254567230377
Jefferson fractures are divided into stable and unstable fracture depending on the integrity of the transverse ligament.	0.4705420572174016
Stable Jefferson fractures are treated conservatively with good outcome while unstable Jefferson fractures are probably best treated operatively with a posterior atlanto-axial or occipito-axial stabilization and fusion.	0.49712381002276945
The authors preferred treatment modality is the immediate open reduction of the dislocated lateral masses combined with a stabilization in the reduced position using a transarticular screw fixation C1/C2 according to Magerl.	0.560191049902751
This has the advantage of saving the atlanto-occipital joints and offering an immediate stability which makes immobilization in an halo or Minerva cast superfluous.	0.4019236343589473
In late instabilities C1/2 with incongruency of the lateral masses occurring after primary conservative treatment, an occipito-cervical fusion is indicated.	0.5392244897642238
Isolated fractures of the lateral masses are very rare and may, if the lateral mass is totally destroyed, be a reason for an occipito-cervical fusion.	0.7152857105868844
Fractures of the transverse processes may be the cause for a thrombosis of the vertebral artery.	0.8848164311795981
No treatment is necessary for the fracture itself.	0.6980972622398876
Reported is the case of a 36-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 with lethal haemorrhage from rupture of the left common iliac artery.	0.6830673812748501
Histologically and immunohistochemically, no hints on angiodysplasia as a possible cause of bleeding were detected.	0.556287072275619
Considering the literature and the histological findings in the area of rupture, a local weakness of the vascular wall caused by the neighbouring neurofibromatous proliferates was most probably the reason for bleeding.	0.809541914750393
We report on a 2-year-old girl with chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC).	0.6719581378994938
Concomitantly with a feverish gastrointestinal infection caused by Salmonella enteritidis, the child presented with lesions resembling impetigo contagiosa on the legs and face.	0.4477848174891102
Following antibiotic treatment with cephalosporins p.o.	0.30701175588782037
she developed typical symptoms of CBDC, i.e.	0.3274980995677828
tense blisters on erythematous skin in the perineal area, on the flexor aspects of the thighs and upper arms and on the face.	0.5680113243410373
Direct immunofluorescence revealed a linear IgA deposition along the basement membrane zone, confirming the diagnosis of CBDC.	0.3737930569390954
These lesions cleared rapidly after treatment with dapsone p.o.	0.49949454920000885
This case prompted us to consider new aspects of the pathogenesis, clinical entity and treatment of this rare bullous disease of childhood.	0.7085389556018836
Systemic administration of strontium-89 is an important option for pain relief in advanced prostate carcinoma with multiple osseous metastases.	0.5713894990588048
Recently, rhenium-186-HEDP was introduced as a new substance which has important advantages (shorter physical half-life, scintigraphic imaging, dose distribution).	0.5443638428426256
The myelosuppressive effect can be estimated more accurately in advance, so that adverse effects can be reduced and the treatment can be repeated after a shorter period of time and more often.	0.6789827261841241
Our study comprises 15 treatments with rhenium-186-HEDP in advanced prostate cancer patients using the 1.4- to 2-fold standard dose.	0.6922125712220003
The response rate, estimated as reduction in pain and increase in patient mobility, was 87 % with no major myelosuppressive effects.	0.7310473283284017
The mean duration of pain relief was 4-6 weeks.	0.6407206099648687
All four patients with repeated therapy were also responding to the second treatment.	0.5514784127586411
Radionuclide therapy for painful osseous metastases with rhenium-186-HEDP appears to be an effective and, even at higher doses, safe procedure.	0.6927212236718008
Cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressive drug which is widely used to treat renal and central nervous system manifestation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).	0.4784281724638982
It is employed especially to prevent renal failure in lupus nephritis.	0.4135510412555062
Within the last decade intravenous cyclophosphamide bolus therapy has become the standard therapy in severe SLE due to its tendency towards a higher efficacy and fewer side effects as compared to oral application.	0.6756645478428845
Studies on the slightly more cost-effective oral cyclophosphamide bolus therapy have recently been published, however, there are no data on long-term results yet.	0.714414200928396
Here, we review the effects and side effects of cyclophosphamide as well as recent clinical studies on cyclophosphamide bolus therapy in SLE.	0.7247076988735697
Because of the possible side effects, especially the high risk of malignancies, which sharply increases at a cumulative dose of approximately 60g, cyclophosphamide should be used cautiously.	0.7502746136535849
Cyclophosphamide bolus therapy should only be performed in hospitals with special experience.	0.6300855328548712
The optimal time to perform acute ACL reconstruction with respect to arthrofibrosis is discussed.	0.5465631240480654
Most authors prefer delayed surgery.	0.1394145576806717
The definition of the term "acute" varies between 48 hours and 4 weeks.	0.4890130573323025
In this study the limit was set at 60 hours.	0.6537683913915967
Acute ACL reconstruction was performed in 39 patients and delayed surgery in 35 after they had regained full ROM.	0.5821855212810453
The incidence of arthrofibrosis was not higher in the acutely operated group whereas overall inability to work was 44% lower in this population.	0.5801170280349653
When the indication is clear, we think that acute ACL reconstruction may be performed within 60 hours without a higher risk of postoperative development of arthrofibrosis.	0.6314102256525473
Nowadays, this strategy should also be considered for economic reasons.	0.7778245623164318
After some introductory remarks on the influence of psychosocial risk factors on the developmental outcome of premature infants this review summarizes the current knowledge about intervention programs for prematures and their parents with a special focus on parent-centered programs.	0.6130375321984802
Positive effects of intervention programs are found in an improvement of cognitive development, parental sensitivity and the home environment.	0.6436226889088255
Only parent-centered interventions enhanced the quality of parent-infant interaction.	0.4440267116250904
It is questioned if those effects are also reliable for very premature infants and are found in the long term.	0.5394390555582564
Further programs should focus on parent- and parent-infant centered interventions.	0.5165711105215199
Methodological problems of intervention studies and further research perspectives on parent-centered interventions are discussed.	0.4457915802153573
The surgical therapy of the rupture of a distal biceps tendon and a modified postoperative treatment is described.	0.6999325346150201
Mainpoint is the early treatment in anaclisis of Kleinert as it is standardized in the treatment of ruptures of the flexor tendons of the hand.	0.5439865091901349
A forearm orthesis with a simply ROM-joint without reboundmechanism was used.	0.2575703819520826
Possible benefits are shown and further industrial evolution seems to be indicated.	0.38796017590857523
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP) are involved in important processes of tumor invasion and metastasis.	0.6111077496553621
In the study presented, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and 3 (MMP3), the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) and the complex MMP1/TIMP1 were measured by ELISA tests specific for these proteins in blood plasma.	0.7867019203773293
These components have been investigated in prostate cancer patients (PCa) with metastases (n = 18; T2, 3, 4 pN1, 2M1), prostate cancer patients without metastases (n = 29; T2, 3 pN0M0), patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH; n = 29) and in healthy men (n = 35).	0.722765862281878
Mean values of MMP1 and of the complex MMP1/TIMP1 were not different among the four groups.	0.5067520487629007
The mean values of MMP3 and especially TIMP1 were significantly higher in prostate cancer patients with metastases compared with controls, BPH patients and prostate cancer patients without metastases.	0.5587046806116548
Ten of these 18 patients had TIMP1 levels higher than the upper reference limit.	0.4432967065975921
TIMP1 concentrations correlate to the tumor stage but not to the tumor grade.	0.6176267824199193
These results indicate, that TIMP1 could be an potential marker for metastases in prostate cancer patients.	0.6043005387560673
The interventional occlusion of atrial septal defects still represents an experimental approach.	0.41731058016021283
As in all intracardiac implants able the double umbrella device (ASDOS) is affected by late complications, particularly when involving umbrella thrombosis and umbrella dislocations.	0.5908591907268267
The demonstration of 4 case reports shows that late postinterventional complications can manifest in unspecific cardial and noncardial symptoms in patients with an ASDOS device.	0.5175180605253645
The diagnosis of a late complication was in all cases confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography and represents an indication for immediate surgical explantation.	0.7204743492940051
For early diagnosis and safe handling of late complications after ASDOS implantation the knowledge of the emergency physician about postinventional problems of this device is essential.	0.6712569592433737
Every ASDOS patient who is suspected of suffering from late postinterventional complications should undergo immediate transesophageal echocardiography.	0.399737756844303
The emergency physician should get in touch with the implantation center immediately.	0.4323125288242969
Furthermore, the concept of interventional occlusion therapy of atrial septum defects needs further development to avoid late complications.	0.49852592640515814
The goal of cardiocerebral resuscitation is to return to the pre-arrest level of neurological function and to reintegrate the patient into his former social circumstances.	0.44861058053148695
This study evaluated the long-term outcome of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in a country-area.	0.6920375649739589
The economic burden of congestive heart failure is significant.	0.4359603647831247
Approximately 1 to 2% of total health care expenditure is attributed to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of congestive heart failure.	0.7448250173742809
A great share of this expenditure is related to the costs of long-term complications and productivity losses.	0.6595610453587372
In order to manage these costs, providers and policymakers increasingly have to focus on economicaly attractive interventions.	0.41819375915749346
Teleconsultation is a consultation between two or more physicians about the diagnostic work-up and therapeutic strategy in the treatment of an individual case by means of modern telematics.	0.614133755373476
Due to more complex therapeutic strategies and legally defined formal requirements, the need for teleconsultation will increase significantly in the future.	0.6216594173938316
Rapid technical improvements in telematics will progressively facilitate the practical performance of teleconsultation (based upon an ISDN network in the beginning, later on by the use of a national health network).	0.4727135563609767
The medicolegal aspects of teleconsultation have already been defined sufficiently for use in surgery.	0.42996857257470356
However, the question of adequate financial compensation for this type of medical service is still unclear.	0.6357582876745811
All 459 surgeons and orthopedists in private practice in Berlin (approx.	0.32193110582656975
3.5 Million inhabitants) were contacted in March 1997 and asked to cooperate.	0.6693318316151318
An 18-point questionnaire was sent out to record the physician's experience with atraumatic and posttraumatic neck complaints, which was returned by only 112 (25%).	0.6442573779221983
According to their assessment these physicians treated ca.	0.39385131911054844
47 000 atraumatic patients with cervical complaints and ca.	0.2828463479182789
7800 with a history of a preceeding trauma over a 12-month-period (1996).	0.538551518320274
All responders had treated patients with posttraumatic complaints; about 60% stated having treated between 20 and 60 patients per year, 25% a smaller and 15% a greater number of patients.	0.7467246372181422
The average treatment time was stated to be 2-5 weeks by 60% of the physicians, 10% listed a peak of 6-7 weeks and another 10% in excess of this peak.	0.7596899456062889
Half of the physicians stated having also treated patients with a cervical trauma not caused by another person (a total of 500 cases).	0.7273971502366035
Symptoms/findings were considered as specific for a traumatic origin by ca.	0.38575237931451417
50% of the physicians and as nonspecific by the other half.	0.7557209902020119
It is noteworthy that the physician's point of view was influenced by personal accident experience (accident as a car passenger): 54% of the 26 physicians with posttraumatic cervical complaints considered these symptoms to be traumaspecific compared to only 35% of 40 physicians with accidents but without cervical symptoms.	0.5684539763422178
The statement that financial gains are frequently a motivating factor for patients that influenced the symptoms and course was confirmed by 22% of the physicians without accident experience compared to 62% of the physicians with accidents without cervical involvement.	0.6460755712880834
Of the physicians 32% were already familiar with personal cervical complaints in middle age unrelated to trauma and another 18% considered them sometimes a disease parameter.	0.6014086404018201

The paper reminds of the many psychiatrists, neurologists, and pathologists connected with scientific work in neuropathology who were expelled from Germany between 1933 and 1939 because of defamation by the Nuremberg Laws or because of their political opposition.	0.4621445349586755
Many of these colleagues saw their only way out as suicide.	0.35445964056094725
Short biographies give an orientation about the destiny of the expelled physicians in their host countries.	0.371467803879489
The effort made after 1945 to give these emigrated colleagues again an adaequate position in Germany have not been very intensive.	0.3658949117637593
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used as a diagnostic tool for special indications in oral and maxillofacial surgery.	0.6461711313613894
We describe a new MRI technique that presents images in a panoramic view analogous to orthopantomography.	0.42398771144798286
This technique is based on three-dimensional T1- and T2-weighted sequences.	0.7061273781506925
The familiar panoramic view in MRI provides better orientation and makes diagnosis faster and easier.	0.2939864171082358
However, the acquisition time is long (6-12 min per sequence), with a correspondingly high risk of motion artifacts.	0.7918564483266204
Moreover, the final workup is also time-consuming.	0.5880577790638085
These restrictions could be overcome by progress in hardware and software.	0.2724299307792886
There are promising indications for dental MRI.	0.2861070354728512
During recent years home ventilation has been shown to be useful for a growing number of patients with neuromuscular diseases and respiratory insufficiency caused by weakness of the respiratory muscles.	0.7181156998669996
Despite its technical simplicity, home ventilation leads to a number of social, ethical, medical and infrastructural problems.	0.5661390441180979
This consensus paper discusses the special situation of patients with neuromuscular diseases in home ventilation and describes the current thinking in the following topics: (1) definition of home ventilation; (2) aims of home ventilation; (3) indications and preconditions of home ventilation; (4) techniques and forms of home ventilatory support; (5) preparation for and practical questions of home ventilation; (6) stopping home ventilation.	0.6072953350047398
Pseudo-obstruction of the colon is characterized by a massive colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction.	0.5223787841864382
It is rarely after hip surgery, however, untreated it may be complicated by a life threatening perforation of the colon.	0.6021721505019141
In a retrospective analysis we reviewed 11 patients (4 women, 7 men, mean age 75.2 years, range 67 to 86 years) with pseudo-obstruction of the colon after hip surgery in the years 1995 to 1998.	0.8575262957027664
In relation to all patients aged 65 years and older who underwent surgery of the hip, the prevalence was 1.06%.	0.8620878330534103
The leading clinical symptom was abdominal distension.	0.2657767105239253
On plain x-rays, dilatation of the colon measured 13.3 cm on average (9-16 cm).	0.7056045408076146
In two patients (18%) adaequate application of drugs stimulating the gastro-intestinal motility was sufficient, whereas in 8 patients (73%) colonoscopic decompression had to be performed.	0.6705132426964855
In three of these, the procedure failed and because of persistent symtoms a coecostomy was performed.	0.620471294774106
One patient underwent immediate laparotomy because of peritonitis.	0.28959728507408306
2 patients (18%) died because of a complicated course.	0.7003343221455179
Non operative treatment should not exceed 24 hours, endoscopic decompression and tube placement is considered as the treatment of choice.	0.6185073426203179
In cases of failure of these procedures, perforation of the colon and/or peritonism, urgent laparotomy with open decompression by a coecostomy is essential.	0.5977800198632423
Anti-semitism increased from year to year in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945.	0.2751147317377173

Introduction: It was our aim to evaluate the results of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair (TAPP) with regard to recurrent hernias treated in our department.	0.7680744843315289
Methods: Included were 276 operations for first or subsequent recurrence of inguinal hernia previously treated with suture repair.	0.3734069327349759
All final repairs were carried out using the TAPP technique.	0.3010072186234583
The data were collected prospectively.	0.7053272357963216
The patients were examined 2 weeks and 1 year postoperatively.	0.9162079581615846
The rate of follow-up amounted to 78.1 % at 1 year after operation.	0.7109625266221782
Results: Perioperative complications were monitored prospectively and divided into intraoperative, minor and major.	0.5101517819821273
The overall complication rate amounted to 9 %, major complications 5.3 %.	0.6044384497215693
The re-recurrence rate was 0.4 %.	0.5818878053472454
Conclusions: Because of the general advantages of laparoscopic surgery and the low recurrence rate we prefer laparoscopic hernioplasty using the TAPP technique.	0.6613859907909132
Diseases of the hindfoot are associated with considerable functional impairment and therefore may hamper patients' movements during gait considerably.	0.5650185251411661
Because of biomechanical overload, articular structures, tendons and ligaments are prone to early degenerative changes during the course of rheumatic diseases as visible with plain film radiography, sonography (US), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).	0.4895121944330104
Findings may occur as arthritis of major joints or in the form of fibroostitis and bursitis of the os calcis.	0.5268693131971852
Despite the progressive course of rheumatic diseases and characteristic imaging findings, high variability of X-ray signs may occur.	0.6086744137777709
Plain film radiograms and high-resolution ultrasonography play a key role in imaging rheumatic diseases of the hindfoot.	0.6126046167911455
MRI supports imaging diagnosis in selected cases.	0.2629392611109491
The principal goals of diagnostic imaging are precise and reproducible documentation of morphologic abnormalities and differentiated analysis for planning proper conservative or surgical treatment.	0.37986203345787695
Background: We evaluated the prevalence of the loss of visual acuity due to loss of the central portion of the visual field and foveolar fixation in the first week after glaucoma filtering surgery.	0.7924642731434651

In vitro assessment of bFGF release from the PLA implants by immunoassay showed that loading of PLA with crushed lyophilized bFGF resulted in a rapid and high release, while loading by solubilized bFGF and relyophilization led to a low and more regular release of the polypeptide growth factor.	0.5206492549008384
Intestinal neuronal dysplasia (IND) was initially described as a developmental abnormality of the submucous plexus in children.	0.566341463441632
In recent years this abnormality has also been observed in adults with chronic constipation.	0.5692364199358965
The aim of this study was a morphometric characterization of this disease.	0.6362066513847211
The investigation was performed with 10 adults with IND, compared with 10 healthy control probands.	0.6591760627703137
The best diagnostic indicator of IND proved to be the detection of 6-10 giant ganglia with more than 7 nerve cells in 15 biopsy sections.	0.6475657363546298
IND is an interesting cause of chronic constipation which can be histologically verified.	0.5063965419607485
Extracorporal shock-wave application (ESWA) has been used in the treatment of stones located in the kidneys, bile, pancreas and the glandula parotis.	0.49936711856618293
In the last 2 years several studies have shown the benefit of ESWA in the treatment of soft-tissue disorders and tendinosis calcarea.	0.6424934883171989
To date, the exact mechanism is unknown.	0.5700689578828105
Local hyperemia following damage or afferent inhibition is discussed.	0.21193167176171293
The possibilities and indications of ESWA with respect to several syndroms are presented.	0.4271479740365568
The results show the benefit of ESWA in the treatment of chronic soft-tissue disorders without severe side effects.	0.6601657748914137
Some patients showed small subcutaneous hematomas and erosion of the skin when energies about 20 mJ were used.	0.47053189705062765
Forty-seven of 84 of the patients obtained complete relief; 24 patients showed a marked reduction in their complaints.	0.7260394325346395
In only 13 of 84 cases was the treatment unsuccessful.	0.39359598706897425
Up to now there are no facts concerning the loosening rate of the cemented titanium stem (Trios).	0.5963989943315995
The central guiding canula and the longitudinal drilled stem shall ensure a symmetric cement mantle.	0.2994300566652155
Management of laryngeal carcinoma located at the anterior commissure remains controversial.	0.486714032111486
Local control rates with radiotherapy or surgery are not as good as those seen after treatment of midcord lesions.	0.5011567140103572
The vertical partial laryngectomy with epiglottic reconstruction (VPLER) may be a more successful approach to such lesions.	0.6034435071815666
The charts of all patients treated for larynx carcinoma between 1991 and 1996 at the authors' institutions were reviewed to identify those patients treated with VPLER as described by Sedlacek in 1965, Kambic in 1976 and Tucker in 1979.	0.568543935610037
Indications for performing surgery and outcome data of patients were collected and analyzed according to the indications for surgery, surgical technique, perioperative complications, oncological outcomes and functional results.	0.7320329904558973
Twelve patients were identified that had been treated with VPLER.	0.701504395955449
Indications for surgery included five patients with local recurrences following endoscopic laser partial laryngectomies, four cases with previously untreated primary tumors at the anterior commissure (T2 N0-2 M0), two with local recurrences following radiotherapy, and one with recurrence following frontolateral partial laryngectomy.	0.7152159009429543
There were no postoperative complications except for one laryngocutaneous fistula that required secondary repair.	0.5044547141800417
All patients were able to swallow at the tenth postoperative day.	0.44175223263612673
All had their tracheostomies closed after completion of wound healing, (a mean of 17 days after surgery).	0.7361299249183725
Phonatory results were usually poor.	0.21070714643537328
Two local recurrences occurred during the follow-up period.	0.487495231969536
However, both patients were salvaged with total laryngectomies and have since been free from disease.	0.5629500516409879
All other patients are alive and well.	0.4489811516320941
Our findings show that VPLER is an effective surgical approach for carcinoma at the anterior commissure of the larynx that cannot be adequately managed with transoral laser surgery or simple frontolateral partial laryngectomy.	0.5205808343265967
This study demonstrates that the procedure can be successfully applied to the treatment of local recurrences following initial raditherapy or surgery.	0.7274867352159096
No major complications occurred in our study.	0.6330462142008114
Traditionally, intra-vitam diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of brain supplying arteries is a domain of conventional selective angiography.	0.5040592944573024
We are aware of only two publications reporting of ultrasound displayed intimal and medial variants of carotid artery FMD, in one case each.	0.5288726583035366
We present a patient in whom color-coded duplex-sonography revealed a web-like carotid artery bulb stenosis meeting the specific criteria of a subtype of intimal FMD.	0.48991540330432465
The relationship between depression and the outcome of low back surgery was investigated.	0.6958313946422939
Data analysis was based on two assumptions: (1) Presurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery, and, therefore, depression can be interpreted as a risk factor for surgical failure.	0.6242525424128422
(2) Postsurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery, and therefore, depression can be interpreted as a response to treatment failure.	0.681999251610051
The sample was made up of 78 patients who had undergone lumbar nucleotomy and 132 patients with lumbar spondylodesis.	0.510513517717001
Treatment outcome was evaluated 6 months after surgery in the nucleotomy group and 9 months after surgery in the spondylodesis group.	0.7280395437451606
Depression was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).	0.2999445664656184
Measures of treatment outcome were an objective rating system for the surgical result, functional impairment, return to work, subjective estimations of the patient, and pain intensity.	0.7293086674704798
Presurgical depression scores showed no significant relationship with surgical outcome in nucleotomy patients.	0.4742132673355373
In spondylodesis patients, however, there was a significant negative correlation with the patients' subjective outcome ratings.	0.8390871443509511
Postsurgical depression scores, on the other hand, were significantly related to almost all of the outcome variables in both treatment groups.	0.7071662861322989
Patients with clinically relevant postsurgical depression scores were significantly more likely not to benefit sufficiently from surgery than those with clinically not relevant depression scores.	0.5090607104751634
Our findings favour assumption 2 over assumption.	0.21852403374193166
In the light of our findings, depressiveness is interpreted as a response to a non-beneficial outcome of surgery.	0.4902771677102971
The need for an interdisciplinary approach combining psychological counseling or treatment and physical therapy for those patients who do not benefit from surgery is discussed.	0.600256703018619
Using electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT) with short exposure times of 100 or 50 ms and the capability of acquiring up to 2 x 17 images/s it is possible to study most of the important morphological and functional determinants of the heart.	0.6094634410675619
Various examples of studies in acute and chronic cardiac diseases are shown to demonstrate the use of EBCT to determine quantitatively left ventricular volumes (ml), myocardial mass (g), wall thickness changes over the cardiac cycle (mm/s), myocardial perfusion (ml/100 g/min) and the extent of coronary calcification (calcium score) and qualitatively the state of the proximal 4-6 cm of the subepicardial coronary arteries.	0.7058994741012167
The knowledge of these determinants seems very useful in excluding cardiac dysfunction, in the early recognition of cardiac disease and in the evaluation of the haemodynamic severity of coronary artery stenotic lesions.	0.8147622895751812
Further interdisciplinary studies are necessary to assess the clinical validity of these cardiac determinants, especially myocardial perfusion, using this advanced CT technology.	0.6507796371335561
Fractures and dislocations of the elbow are some of the most common injuries in childhood and adolescence.	0.8786760192846259
The majority occur in sport and play activities, e. g., a fall from gymnastics apparatus or a bike, or from popular sports items, such as skateboards or in-line skates.	0.5230626731074467
The injuries can be divided into pure dislocations of the joint and fractures of the distal humerus, proximal radius and ulna, or combinations of both.	0.7283948406533136
In addition, extra- and intraarticular fracture types are defined, with the latter as partial or complete joint lesions.	0.6891929292532079
Dislocations of the elbow joint or the radial head can occur as single injuries or in combination with a fracture.	0.6778888124413914
Supracondylar fractures and avulsion fractures of the medial epicondyle are the most frequent extraarticular lesions of the distal humerus.	0.8220001300216457
Fractures of the lateral condyle prevail is incomplete intraarticular lesions.	0.5178094929909679
In the forearm, radial head and neck fractures are predominant while typical and atypical Monteggia injuries have a special status.	0.5403576849443276
The complex joint construction and the age-dependent appearance of the epiphyseal ossification centers sometimes make a correct radiological diagnosis difficult.	0.5802185885973342
The trauma history and an exact, clinical examination help to verify the injury, as do comparative X-ray studies of the uninjured side when necessary (but not routinely).	0.6854784434598017
Unlike other anatomical areas, most elbow injuries - even in the growing skeleton - are treated operatively.	0.8599407908069064
Hereby, the growth plates have to be respected using minimal amounts of small implants.	0.6519384262556385
Additional immobilization in a cast for 2 - 4 weeks is necessary in most cases but does not lead to a functional deficit - in contrast to adults.	0.7965839139909704
The implants should be removed as early as possible.	0.3307845027092275
Despite all therapeutic efforts, a significant number of late sequelae, such as malunions and functional impairment, can be seen.	0.6516284142118643
The rate of long-term complications increases in cases of untreated displacement of fragments or joint instability.	0.5983543952041717
Corrective measures are performed only in selected cases and after the growth plates are closed.	0.6562112735799125
Our own treatment regime is demonstrated using exemplary clinical cases of the different injuries and the results of a long-term follow-up study on sports injuries of the elbow in children.	0.8127884549882367
Errors in diagnosis and therapy, as well as possible complications, are pointed out.	0.7145465860980296
2-adrenergic agonists, mimicking the action of the inhibitory transmitter norepinephrine, cause antinociception due to postsynaptic inhibition of spinothalamic projection neurons, presynaptic inhibition at the central nervous system termination of primary sensory nerves, presynaptic inhibition of brainstem noradrenergic neurons and a generalized decrease in central nervous system sympathetic efferent activity.	0.441735118569108
There is a mutual potentiation of antinociceptive effects of clonidine and morphine.	0.44535948280492355
Clonidine is used in chronic pain states for treatment of neuropathic, neuralgic and deafferentiating pain.	0.6625875614663237
Based on a meta-analysis of the studies published in the years 1996-1996, the therapeutic efficacy of systematically administered clonidine was evaluated in chronic pain states.	0.8780251218020187
Out of 403 screened published studies, only 9 fulfilled the selection criteria.	0.5035860344026866
Besides three case reports with successful clonidine treatment, four placebo-controlled studies could be analyzed treating the following chronic pain states: chest pain despite normal coronary angiograms; painful diabetic neuropathy; postherpetic neuralgia; hyperalgia in patients with sympathetically maintained pain and chronic low back pain.	0.5564463287304305
Although three studies demonstrated statistically significant improvement in pain scores, the improvement in pain relief in these cases was slight.	0.8166734715879652
Long-term treatment was successful in a few responders over a period of 17 months.	0.7475601770637853
Hyperalgesia caused by sympathetically maintained pain was relieved by topical (transdermal) application of clonidine.	0.348107427322605
Based on this evaluation a grade C recommendation is derived, which relates to responders.	0.5579230589605008
Successful treatment is expected only in pain states with increased sympathetic nervous system activity.	0.42032213167533333
Therefore, in chronic pain, treatment with systemic clonidine is of no significant value.	0.8256106579646985
Study objective: To investigate whether automatic tube compensation (ATC) or conventional pressure support (PS) is suit- able to compensate for the work of breathing imposed by the breathing circuit without altering the breathing pattern.	0.6442806079233069
DNA-based prenatal testing of the fetal genotype was performed in a family at risk for recurrence of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).	0.5990743755876934
DNA from cultured fibroblasts and leukocytes from the peripheral blood of the previously affected offspring, DNA from parental leukocytes and DNA from fetal tissue obtained by chorionic villus biopsy was analysed by direct PCR amplification of known polymorphic regions within or flanking the type VII collagen gene, the canditate gene in RDEB.	0.4544786543380763
One flanking marker (D3S2/MspI) as well as two intragenic polymorphisms (C7/MspI, C7/Eco0109I) in exons 30 and 84 were informative in this family.	0.4185214554433345
Thus, based on the haplotype analysis and the lack of evidence for locus heterogeneity in RDEB, a phenotypically healthy child was predicted.	0.5344440457347033
This prediction was confirmed by the birth of a healthy female infant.	0.4559704856551944
The study reports successful determination of the fetal genotype by PCR-based prenatal diagnosis in a family at risk for recurrence of severe RDEB.	0.6110907217838647
Endothelins are peptides with powerful vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties.	0.20438478794545065
It has become evident that endothelins are involved in many regulatory mechanisms of the circulation role both in short and in long term.	0.599499418212129
However, in many cases it remains unclear whether the alteration of the endothelin metabolism is a primary pathology or a secondary phenomenon.	0.7762493508409603
The synthesis of endothelin receptor antagonists and animal models with altered endothelin metabolism have opened a new era of endothelin research that will allow insight into the mechanisms of endothelin-action and eventually might lead to new therapeutic concepts.	0.4947479385074856
This review discusses the evidence both in favor and against pathogenic effects of endothelins in cardiovascular disease.	0.36444597288949915
The combination of fast MR sequences and rapid i. v. injection of paramagnetic contrast media provides information on cerebral perfusion.	0.5009120492166056
MR-perfusion imaging primarily depicts the relative cerebral blood volume.	0.4030689484563524
The aim of this study was to test whether MR-perfusion imaging with a clinical MR scanner using a standard 2D-FLASH sequence provides clinically relevant information on patients with cerebrovascular diseases and brain tumors.	0.5992079499654782
Brain infarctions, lesions in cerebral microangiopathy and occlusions of the carotid artery with very poor collateralization showed definite differences in perfusion imaging compared with normal controls.	0.44131676708013934
However, our results show that acceleration of the imaging sequence and optimization of the contrast bolus and data processing are prerequisites for the clinical use of this method, which in principle may provide information on the absolute cerebral blood volume and even blood flow.	0.8081986916474941
Lumbar Microdiscectomy requires special instruments and provides a good view with a narrow approach.	0.36491047738614196
The microscope is the best surgical aid.	0.48254137521314
Alternatives are a retractorintigrated light or headlamp.	0.22633634778234357
A specific complication of lumbar microdiscectomy - the wrong level - can be minimized by an exact preoperative planning.	0.739277496196598
Other complications like dural lesions and exessive bleeding are less frequent with the microscope because of the better view.	0.46761630711030405
The most severe complications that can occur with any lumbar disc operation, major vessel or visceral injury, can be avoided by lusing the new rongeur with a depth guard.	0.623457324561352
From January 1987 to March 1994 three hospitals in the city of Magdeburg treated a total of 103 subcutaneous Achilles tendon ruptures operatively.	0.47324368337956485
We created a special score to compare the outcome of the different operation techniques used.	0.7558734353404748
Important aspects of the follow-up examination were isokinetic measuring of power and staying power by means of a KIN-TREX dynamic measuring device and the clinical check-up in comparison with the histological results and the patients' history.	0.7851979018720772
Degeneration could only be proved histologically in 38,8 % of the cases.	0.6084066805396567
The average score of all OP methods applied was 767 of possible 1000 points.	0.331681601498016
The adaptation suture (781 points), Silfverskiold's technique (772 points) and the fibrin adhesive technique (754 points) showed approximately the same results.	0.6455911245835939
The theory that all of the ruptures have a histological degeneration background seems to be wrong.	0.5488165866548363
Isokinetic measuring can be very helpful in preparing a postoperative regimen to find the optimum load.	0.47954646081717506
To determine wether a somatic dysfunction of head joints depends from segmental muscle strain, we investigated 89 patients before, during and after general anesthesia.	0.6147486750529517
We examined the disturbed joint motion as exclusive criterion for a somatic dysfunction, because through an anesthesia with endotracheal intubation including complete neuromuscular blockade segmental influences on the inspected joint were eleminated.	0.526510382676647
For complete muscle relaxation as required for orotracheal intubation a non depolarizising muscle relaxant was used.	0.36461473511262943
Somatic dysfunctions were found most frequent for side-inclination and retroflexion in segment O/C1.	0.3224619081830574
Both before as well as during complete neuromuscular blockade could be found in the majority of examinations (89,1 %) similar restraints of joint motions.	0.6910220735526567
To 10,9 % were found, that somatic dysfunctions established before the muscle relaxant was applicated, were no more demonstrable under complete blockade of neuromuscular transmission.	0.7048504739662708
Different theoretical models are presented for the interpretation of our results.	0.5463857255891418
We assume, that the disturbance of one component of the metamer organized segment is the basic phänomenon of somatic dysfunction.	0.5446434356766886
This disturbance break through the spinal segmental inhibition and expand into the segment.	0.30936890361310626
Subsequently we discuss to replace the term "somatic dysfunction" through "segmental dysfunction" and to define it as increasing of nozizeptive afference in the segment over a determined period of time with breakthrough of the spinal segmental inhibition threshold.	0.5945311360892789
Postoperative intestinal atonia is a complication which is likely to occur in patients predisposed for constipation and in patients after intra-abdominal operations.	0.6508520263524632
The postoperative delay of bowel movement, however, is often also related to the type of anaesthesia being used.	0.5629953743682171
In order to evaluate the magnitude of an anaesthetic-induced postoperative delay of bowel movement, two types of intravenous-based anaesthesia using fentanyl/midazolam (1 mg/25 mg; dosage 0.1 ml/kg/h), and ketamine/midazolam (250 mg/25 mg; dosage 0.1 ml/kg/h) respectively were compared with a volatile anaesthetic technique (enflurane; mean concentration 1.5 vol%).	0.6988195896722805
In three groups of patients (each n=15) undergoing elective surgery of the lower extremities, induction of anaesthesia was accomplished with methohexital (1 - 1.5 mg) followed by succinylcholine (1.5 mg/kg) to facilitate intubation.	0.854456858908297
For the maintenance of muscle relaxation vecuronium bromide was used.	0.3743967249042241
All patients were given droperidol to prevent postoperative emesis, and they were artifically ventilated with N2O/O2 (60: 40) to normal end-expiratory CO2 concentrations.	0.781030234816589
No anticholinergic agents were used at the end of operation since they are known to interfere with bowel motility.	0.4848753167188809
In order to determine gastro-intestinal motility, the H2 exhalation test was used.	0.5961746579300815
For this purpose 40 g lactulose in 100 ml of water was given to all patients via a gastral tube shortly before extubation.	0.5152998289701957
Lactulose is broken down by bacteria once it enters the colon, and H2 is released, taken up by the vascular system and exhaled.	0.48926091982096176
Postoperatively, patients were asked to exhale into a 20-ml syringe every 10 min.	0.546780599786514
The content was analysed for hydrogen (ppm), using an electrochemical sensor (GMI exhaled hydrogen monitor).	0.45064920503333006
From the time of lactulose instillation to a threefold increase in endexpiratory hydrogen concentration (compared to the preoperative value), gastro-coecal transit time was computed.	0.5212837747116668
All three groups of patients were comparable in age, height and body weight.	0.7342421736991984
Also, the duration of operation was comparable in all three groups.	0.7834568968114407
Mean gastro-coecal transit time was 204 ( +/- 19.6 SD) min following enflurane, 302 ( +/- 32.8 SD) min following fentanyl/-midazolam and 210 ( +/- 28.8 SD) min following ketamine/midazolam anaesthesia.	0.5991025239274937
The gastro-intestinal inhibition after the opioid-based anaesthetic technique was significantly prolonged (p<0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test).	0.4770310132497191
There was no significance between patients after ketamine-based anaesthesia and those who had the volatile anaesthetic.	0.6060183544273718
When using intravenous anaesthesia with an opioid, gastro-intestinal inhibition, especially in patients prone to have constipation, is likely to develop postoperatively.	0.6931743939444532
In classical neuroleptanaesthesia and in analgosedation in the ICU, the simultaneous use of the butyrophenone droperidol seems to counteract the inhibition of opioid-related gastrointestinal motility.	0.5561140274570232
In cases of opioid-related gastrointestinal atonia a gastrokinetic compound may be necessary to overcome this effect on intestinal motility.	0.5114516435297326
In a prospective study 20 patients were monitored with serial sonograms and radiographs during distraction osteogenesis at the lower limb.	0.5504338897269729
All sonograms were obtained in four planes using a 7.5 MHz transducer.	0.5753173269550931
The distraction gap was seen as a sonolucent area in all patients after corticotomy.	0.656792814349723
At an average of 20.7 (14-28) days after the beginning of the distraction, echogenic foci occurred and showed increasing longitudinal alignment with further distraction.	0.7814318667455833
Radiographical signs of beginning mineralization were seen an average of 48.3 days after the start of the distraction.	0.6781618855981737
Exact measurement of the distraction gap was possible in all patients during lengthening.	0.7727893792900137
Bone healing complications and hematoma could be detected by ultrasound.	0.5561431038464613
A rapid increase of bone mineralization was seen after the distraction was stopped.	0.5164402071729323
With increasing cortication of the regenerate bone, sonograms showed a hyper-reflecting solid line so that further mineralization and the time of removal of the fixator could not be assessed by ultrasound.	0.5531012077654972
Ultrasound is more sensitive than radiography in identifying new bone formation during distraction, measuring the length of the distraction gap, and detecting early bone-healing complications and can therefore reduce the need for radiographs.	0.6341479348654195
The interval between the onset of symptoms in patients with head and neck cancers and the introduction of treatment was evaluated.	0.6566265759548437
During a 1-year period, patients were interviewed to determine the duration of any delays from the onset of complaints until the first visit to a doctor.	0.730567135582278
Also asked was how long it took to be referred to an ENT specialist and actual referral to our department.	0.3825952884962447
We then determined the interval from diagnosis to the introduction of therapy.	0.5291057555022178
It was found that the delay of patients who went directly to an otorhinolaryngologist was shorter (median, 8 weeks) than that of patients who first went to their family doctors (median, 13 weeks) (P<0.02).	0.8472062108187438
The latter then took an additional 4 weeks before sending patients to an otorhinolaryngologist.	0.41138317650008405
Referral from the ENT specialist to our department took another 2 weeks, as well as our staging and pre-therapeutic management.	0.5088665394197501
Our findings show that the patient himself is the critical factor in delaying diagnosis and therapy.	0.6433898894483905
Tumor patients with greater professional qualification went to their doctors earlier (P<0.0001) or more often went directly to an ENT specialist (P<0.002).	0.5179952714793171
Consultations of physicians without experience in otorhinolaryngology caused yet further delays.	0.29169939107347304
The present study deals with long-term dimensional changes in cemented Müller-type total hip endoprostheses.	0.5082171580549504
Creep and wear contribute to different extents to the dimensional changes in polyethylene.	0.3068130663058802
The total amount of polyethylene wear is represented by the displacement of the femoral head into the socket.	0.47419246857778785
Within the first postoperative years, the head shifts up to a relatively high rate of about 0.5 mm per year.	0.9942025317024148
This rate diminishes after 5 years to an average of about 0.1 mm (ceramics) and 0.2 mm (metal) per year.	0.7696653806344843
Values exceeding 0.2 mm per year for the shift of the femoral head are considered to be unfavourable with regard to a probable loosening of the prosthesis.	0.6340098018699063
In this study we determined the orientation of the centre of the prosthetic head in relation to the wire marker of the polyethylene cup, comprising in all 369 total hip prostheses.	0.6638199980560335
After an average of 77 months, 96 % of the prostheses with ceramic heads (n = 109) had a wear rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.	0.7454723612577655
Using metal heads (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10) this rate could only be measured in 71 % (n = 109) of the prostheses (61.5 months).	0.7396807173219219
The combination ceramics-polyethylene produces half of the total amount of wear produced by metal-polyethylene.	0.44156951537719114
Younger patients should preferably be treated with a ceramic ballhead.	0.6113689205287085
The so-called amyopathic dermatomyositis is a rare variant of dermatomyositis which has attracted increasing interest during the last years.	0.5497106276392697
One finds the classical signs of dermatomyositis such as periorbital edema and erythema, erythematous macular and papular lesions localized at bony prominences (so-called Gottron's papules), generalized pruritus, photosensitivity, and a cutaneous histopathologic picture compatible with skin lesions of dermatomyositis.	0.5041673944606974
Crucial for the diagnosis is the exclusion of myositis by clinical examination, EMG and histology.	0.7424472732477586
Furthermore, longterm supervision of patients is advisable in order not to miss the appearance of early signs of myositis.	0.5076271167045385
The longest reported follow-up of amyopathic dermatomyositis patient is 4 years; however, it cannot be excluded that these cases will eventually culminate in classical dermatomyositis.	0.5800318966111536
In this paper we describe two cases and discuss the differential diagnosis and therapy; also, the term "Premyopathic dermatomyositis" is proposed, to indicate that the full picture is to be expected in most cases.	0.8646833941441906
The primary renal angiosarcoma is a rarely seen highly malignant tumor.	0.44074551334679574
Making a diagnosis based on histology may prove difficult.	0.3538092065412416
Because of hematogenous formation of metastases and bad prognosis in most cases we recommend that the surgical intervention be followed by the well tolerated systemic chemotherapy with Doxorubicin and Ifosfamid.	0.6510395518641025
This study compares the results of the outpatient-based program of the Cochlear Implant Center Ruhr with inpatient-based rehabilitation, which is almost exclusively performed in Germany.	0.6262750010565895
The Department of Otorhinolaryngology at the University of Essen in Germany provided 52 patients with either 22- or 24-channel Nucleus cochlear implants from March 1996 to July 1999.	0.5993333473032112
Almost all patients (n=49) were rehabilitated on an outpatient basis, which is the standard in many cochlear implant centers outside Germany.	0.7789579694597564
Syringe drivers are used in anaesthetics, intensive care and emergency medicine to deliver small volumes of highly potent drugs with continuous, constant and reproducible flow.	0.49834288361176815
For early recognition of interruptions of the drug delivery caused by occlusion of the infusion system, an alarm is triggered as soon as the system pressure exceeds a certain limit.	0.6085841709892249
The sensitivity of this alarm depends on the flow rate, type-specific cut-off pressure and the elastic parameters of the infusion system.	0.7247138113868151
The sudden release of pressure built up in the system after occlusion occurred can cause delivery of an uncontrolled drug bolus and hence an additional hazard.	0.47110103832876443
Methods: Six syringe drivers that are widely used in clinical practice were tested for alarm delay and bolus delivery in the event of an occlusion in the system.	0.6391946290079406
First, the alarm pressures at flow rates of 10, 50 and 100 ml/h were measured.	0.620883325855812
Then the alarm delay time and bolus volumes post-occlusion were assessed, using a basic infusion system (syringe+single infusion set).	0.5565117280879993
Finally, several alterations to the system like extension, tap battery with germ filters or branching were made and their impact on alarm delay and bolus volume measured.	0.4784577169689583
Results: Because of the great differences in alarm pressures between the devices tested, there were marked differences in the alarm delay at same flow rates.	0.725006093202635
Predictably, there was an indirect proportional link between alarm delay and flow rate.	0.7124624209444115
Using the basic infusion system, alarm delays between 23 s and 143 min were measured.	0.3306308351693341
In two of the tested syringe drivers, a pressure-release mechanism is activated with the pressure alarm, which prevented bolus application.	0.7135699629209726
In the other devices, release of the pressure in the occluded system caused boli of 0.5-7 ml.	0.8324993504842086
Variations in the actual syringe volume and insertion of a second connection tube had no impact on alarm delay and bolus volume.	0.516534951481332
Tap batteries, parallel running syringe drivers or trapped air in the system, however, caused marked increase in both alarm delay (107%) and bolus volume (+147%).	0.5383766788406862
Discussion: Unidentified occlusions of the system cause grave malfunctioning of syringe drivers.	0.44249294944866013
While applying highly potent drugs, the discontinuation of drug delivery with subsequent bolus application can cause vital danger to the patient.	0.49989510608855703
As a result of the significant time delays in the pressure alarms, the devices tested do not provide sufficient protection against unrecognized system occlusion.	0.622506003362798
Syringe drivers with adjustable alarm pressure can be set close to the actual infusion pressure.	0.4642141293619097
A further important point is that one should aim at a reduction in the elastic properties of the infusion set because of the great impact on alarm delay and bolus volume.	0.6335025850438168
Because the overall results of conservative treatment for distal radial fractures have been unsatisfactory, it is rarely used.	0.6482767241988872
However, minimally invasive methods such as stabilization by external fixation and percutaneous K-wire pinning are being increasingly used.	0.5224875922094266
A justified indication for the use of K-wire pinning is that it provides an opportunity to achieve good and very good short- and long-term anatomic and functional results.	0.665358986669559
Short-term supplementary immobilization with a minimized plaster cast or protective external fixation is generally considered to be useful.	0.5834740056665116
Reports on plaster-free functional treatment after K-wire pinning have been published.	0.4739691278571219
The indications therefore need to be further specified.	0.4824236044341696
Follow-up studies and an analysis of our patients show a strong increase in K-wire stabilization and good-to-very good results in 75% of the cases.	0.8312837922225832
Involvment of the genitouronary tract by lymphoproliferative disorders is rare.	0.24672454189965884
Rapid proliferating Burkitt's lymphomas could mimic acute diseases.	0.18740731292386323
Due to the extreme chemosensitivity, the lymphoma is cureable and surgery should be done only for histology.	0.6193782753957275
Initial surgery should be restricted to acute abdominal complications or complete removal of localised resectable disease.	0.42769362264529437
In any case a multiagent chemotherapy is necessary.	0.4334673611824519
Wet autoclaving is a simple, reliable and time-effective method for antigen retrieval in routinely processed archival material.	0.512394156717183
Both routine diagnostic (e. g., oestrogen and progesterone receptors, cytoskeletal proteins) and research antibodies (e. g. various p53 antibodies, mdm-2, bcl-2, MIB-1) are reported to demonstrate its application.	0.6170301093589546
Wet autoclaving may allow successful application of antibodies in paraffin-embedded tissues designed for use on frozen sections.	0.388348357412954
The technique has the poten-tial to reliably handle up to 200 sections at a time, without evidence of any significant damage to the sections or nuclear morphology.	0.5833133495014413
Classical stable plate osteosynthesis with its anatomical repositioning, absolute stability between fragments and medial support should only be applied to joint fractures and spongy bone.	0.4915406451212091
In cortical bone, the anatomical reposition connected with the plate promotes bone necrosis along the fracture and prevents callus formation.	0.5544019569189453
Direct cortical synthesis, a method also known as "primary bone healing", serves the bone's revascularisation and is not necessarily aimed at healing.	0.643813341226701
Thus, this may also be termed "necrosis healing".	0.6480412063904833
Along the shaft of long bones, elastic plate osteosynthesis, a biological method, is safer than and superior to the rigid technique.	0.6649334952627681
This even applies to short oblique and transverse fractures insofar as nailing does not appear feasible.	0.30874181083776714
Elasticity is achieved by leaving a flexible stretch of at least 2 - 4 holes, i.e.	0.5892666259559379
as long as possible, without screws over the fracture and by employing a titanium plate.	0.6102858968729021
Thus, there is no punctate fatigue leading to plate breakage.	0.5473780488359974
The fitting of third fragments is deliberately left out.	0.2302264753190316
The same applies to all kinds of compression with lag screws, tension devices or DC-gliding holes - and this with the intention of allowing micromovements in the fracture's fissure.	0.5659507022741003
Periost and muscle are not removed and the fracture is not examined.	0.4473268366518296
Healing occurs spontaneously via a fixating callus forming within the first 3 - 6 weeks out of the periost-soft tissue combination.	0.670558152767955
Histomorphological investigation dates the first woven- bone bridges between the fragments to 3 weeks subsequent to the accident.	0.4137134339199101
In Göttingen University trauma centre, 87 fractures have been attended to over 2 years using this technique.	0.47926852216134497
Despite considerable soft-tissue damage, no delayed bone healing, pseudoarthrosis or bone infection has been observed.	0.530778730493039
The risks of elastic plate osteosynthesis lie in unbiological and exaggerated reposition methods, too short a flexible stretch, and insufficient anchorage of the screws.	0.6227429351749126
Diagnosis of a thrombosis in the peripheral veins can now be made with almost 100% certainty using either phlebography or duplex sonography.	0.5877726039800062
A correct diagnosis depends on the expertise of the examiner.	0.41225007155985105
Both methods are available throughout Germany.	0.5203453039414822
Although both are equally suitable for primary diagnostic investigations, duplex sonography has assumed an important role due to the fact that it is not invasive.	0.6649963285493252
Phlebography is vital if there are specific issues that need to be clarified.	0.43679631708343286
This applies if invasive treatment methods are being considered, if an expert opinion is required or if scientific issues need to be determined.	0.6060104614894581
Discrepancy between clinical findings and the results of duplex sonography also constitutes an important indication for phlebography.	0.5727091590448339
In many institutions, both methods are used in a "golden partnership" in cases in which it is important to obtain comprehensive records.	0.8943842931569523
For frequent ventricular ectopic beats, currently, reassurance and pharmacological therapy are the mainstays of treatment.	0.48823021065550315
This study assesses the useful role of catheter ablation in eliminating frequent monomorphic ventricular ectopic beats in severely symptomatic patients.	0.47358254299576935
Catheter ablation was performed in 65 patients with frequent drug refractory ventricular ectopic beats.	0.5845546386774367
The site of origin of ventricular ectopic activity was accurately mapped by using pace mapping, earliest endocardial activation time, and unipolar mapping.	0.521279850869808
In 5 patients a new non-contact mapping was additionally performed.	0.44981250194574074
The ectopic focus was located in the right ventricular outflow tract in 37 and in the left ventricle in 28 patients.	0.7572979501179747
Ventricular ectopic beats were successfully eliminated by catheter ablation in 49/65 patients (75%).	0.5204353525945006
During a mean follow up of 13 +/- 11 months, 9 of 49 successful ablated patients (18%) had a recurrence.	0.7922387761919937
Radiofrequency catheter ablation can be successfully used to eliminate ventricular ectopic activity.	0.5121238784067204
It may, therefore, be a reasonable alternative for the treatment of severely symptomatic, drug resistant monomorphic ventricular ectopic activity.	0.6167099513796811
Injuries of the forefoot are a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons.	0.6184594368024879
After healing of bone and soft tissue damage, posttraumatic metatarsalgia can persist.	0.5533510595066518
The paper presents a therapy algorithm with newly designed insoles, which consist of the common orthopaedic adaptions like a rocker bottom and a stiffening of the sole.	0.5138717668766496
The therapy is shown on two cases.	0.4222988090572234
With these orthotics adequate is possible and pain relief realistic.	0.47333885502223366
Background: Myopic PRK up to 6 D is an approved and safe procedure.	0.49910560224591
The efficacy and safety of combined treatment of myopia and astigmatism in compound myopic astigmatism (PARK) have not yet been demonstrated.	0.5898371954875621
Nitric oxide (NO) can play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and neurotransmission, as well as in non-specific immunoreactions and inflammation in a variety of tissues.	0.6505805132466237
Increased quantities of nitric oxide in respired air can be measured during inflammatory processes.	0.4431084215292587
However, the exact role and precise sources of NO under physiological and pathophysiological conditions within the airways remain to be defined.	0.5770204465706572
We report on a 55-year old patient who presented with a four month history of intermittent left thoracic painful attacks which radiated in the left arm.	0.7761638989153183
Both normal 12 lead electrocardiogram and treadmill stress tests showed no significant ST changes.	0.3975261469993726
A thallium-201 scintigraphy afterwards disclosed a non-transmural septal ischemia.	0.3237705374048213
The consecutively performed diagnostic catheterization revealed a severe, almost pouch-like proximal aneurysm of the right coronary artery with a maximal diameter of 15-20 mm as well as an aneurysmatic modified left coronary artery and an impaired left ventricular function (EF 49%).	0.6449989348917652
In the absence of coronary artery stenosis, the patient was treated conservatively with an ACE inhibitor (lisinoprile 20 mg/day) under accompanying effective anticoagulant therapy with coumadin.	0.7804354834038213
With this strategy the patient has been asymptomtic during the eight month follow-up period.	0.5514536685917845
We investigated in 17 children (mean 7.1 years) the continuous administration of tramadol following augmentation cystoplasty or exstrophy reconstruction.	0.7190407163069344
Mean duration of the tramadol administration on the pediatric ward was 3.8  +/-  1.1 days (initial dosage 0.25 mg/kg/per hour, dose adjustment by the nursing staff).	0.8017139909689067
Mean tramadol consumption was 0.21 mg/kg/h on day 1 and was reduced to 0.08 mg/kg/per hour on day 4.	0.7152837221912467
Median pain score (assessed with ten-step scales) was 5 before treatment and between 2.5 (day 1) and 0.5 (day 5) during therapy.	0.895923623633888
Lowest oxygen saturations (mean) ranged from 93.8 % to 95.2 %.	0.7177116593048222
Three patients (17.6 %) suffered from nausea/vomiting on 3 of 64 treatment days (4.7 %).	0.6490375610014381

The continuous administration of tramadol is a simple and safe procedure following major urological surgery in children.	0.588646940748223
Over the past 5-7 years, there has been a renewed research interest into the mechanism as well as the development of newer "emerging" treatment modalities for atrial fibrillation.	0.7454875058850922
One of these novel therapies is the implantable atrial defibrillator.	0.5280908277446442
In this article we will review the basic and clinical research which has been used in the development of electrode systems and shock waveforms utilized by commercially-available implantable atrial cardioversion devices.	0.6179236105227366
In 26 patients with abscesses in the maxillofacial area, the electrolyte concentrations, pH and osmotic and hydrostatic pressures of the pus fluid were measured and calculated.	0.5242511899273675
The main cations identified were sodium (134  +/-  38 mmol/l) and potassium  (37  +/-  16 mmol/l) and as anions chloride (183  +/-  46 mmol/l) and bicarbonate (10  +/-  4 mmol/l).	0.7164395055731525
The pH value of the pus liquid was 6.164  +/-  0.233.	0.5629404528532524
The calculated mean osmotic pressure of the pus liquid was 7910  +/-  1455 mm Hg, whereas the measured physical pressure inside the abscess was 49  +/-  13 mm Hg.	0.5735216827241731
Both pressure types show time-dependent pressure curves.	0.47664428863814273
With time, the real pressure inside the abscess cavity increases, whereas the osmotic pressure decreases.	0.6358916773160282
There was no relationship between the two pressure types and the different species of microorganisms responsible for the inflammation.	0.7217485999742874
The results of the study reveal that abscesses can be regarded as osmotically active systems, and the mechanism by which the abscess is formed might be as follows.	0.7406170035683947
After penetration of virulent microorganisms into the tissue space, the area of acute inflammation is walled off by the collection of inflammatory cells.	0.5427774026723514
Destruction of tissue by products of the polymorphonuclear leucozytes takes place and results in liquefactive necrosis and a hypertonic abscess cavity.	0.4261555325495499
The inwards-directed flow of tissue fluids into the cavity via the abscess membrane causes volume expansion and generates pressure, two facts that can explain the swelling dynamics and typical symptoms of abscesses in the maxillofacial area.	0.45284515656041263
Internal mammary artery (IMA) bypass grafts have a satisfactorily long lasting blood supply to the myocardium.	0.4256510555490431
Their initial flow capacity can be insufficient with subsequent regional myocardial ischemia.	0.3581060082496868
This study represents a feasable surgical method to evaluate the effectiveness of the IMA graft function by temperature measurement of the heart during warm reperfusion after hypothermic cardioplegia.	0.6413133239238056
Twenty-five patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease underwent coronary artery bypass grafting using the IMA as an arterial graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein grafts to the remaining coronary arteries.	0.6153395203103145
Distal anastomoses were installed during cold intermittent blood-cardioplegic  arrest.	0.24051186466418265
After unclamping the aorta and IMA graft, the temperatures in cardiac front and rear sides were measured during the first five minutes of warm reperfusion.	0.5187979280406347
A sufficient IMA graft function was expressed by a typical rise of temperature: The cardiac front and rear sides showed a parabolic and exponential course, respectively.	0.4658937752850304
The rewarming speed expressed as the first derivative of temperature over time led to a sharp and early peak for the front side, and a smaller and delayed peak for the rear side.	0.6638523460951745
An insufficient IMA graft function could be recognized by atypical temperature courses.	0.378113189435395
Fabry's disease (Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum) is a rare X-chromosome linked recessive disorder belonging to the group of sphingolipoidoses.	0.6249217288185273
The basic defect involves the gene encoding alpha-galactosidase.	0.36865839834713265
Because this enzyme is responsible for decomposition of glycosphingolipids, its deficiency results in their accumulation in endothelial and smooth muscle cells.	0.47013838445042627
With time, generalized angiokeratomas, paresthesias, renal and cardiac insufficiency and cerebrovascular complications develop.	0.4955098939018742
We report a patient who in addition to the well-described findings also showed unique nail fold capillary changes not described so far.	0.6104354105093591
Analysis of serum concentration of alpha-galactosidase identified three female heterozygous carriers in the patient's family.	0.531479841763361
Benign, proliferative changes of the Brunner's gland are very rare and account for about 10 % of duodenal bulb neoplasias.	0.6470275571929492
The authors present a case of Brunner's gland adenoma of unusual dimensions (12 x 5 x 2.5 cm).	0.7150872117978551
The patient presented with vague epigastric discomfort as isolated symptoms.	0.26918477207610575
In this case we performed surgical treatment, including a duodenotomy and polypectomy.	0.7660443423167248
Because they are localized in the submucosa small, superficial endoscopic biopsies may fail to confirm the diagnosis.	0.4640689525194605
Malignancy seems to occur only very rarely, with only 14 cases reported in the literature.	0.6065433191070458
As the majority of Brunner's adenomas are quite small, endoscopic polypectomy will confirm the diagnosis and cure the condition in most cases.	0.62476987361892
Large symptomatic adenomas may require surgical resection.	0.21083666180746619
Objective: How does adjuvant training of strength and endurance influence the muscular, cardial, respiratory, immunological systems, and the quality of life during intrahepatical chemotherapy in a veteran athlete with liver metastasis after resection of a carcinoma of the rectum.	0.6279872807309115
Patient and method: A 58-year-old athlete with metastatic carcinoma of the rectum (pT3, N0, M-liver, G2) underwent regional chemotherapy (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil) via an intrahepatic port system.	0.6775631942200179
Six cycles with 5 days each were applied.	0.29908746788368157
During the intervals between cycles (14 days), beginning in the 6th postoperative week, a strength and endurance training (duration 13 weeks) was carried out twice weekly with an intensity of 40-60 % of the maximum postoperative individual power and endurance (evaluated with weight and treadmill exercise tests and measurement of lactate).	0.6144836476684171
Before and after chemotherapy, an echocardiogram, resting and exercise electrocardiogram, lung function, natural killer cells and the gastrointestinal quality of life index (GLQI) was evaluated.	0.6931647367769144
After chemotherapy was finished, the effects of training were assumed.	0.5643789185462441
Results: Strength increased between 0 % and 144 %.	0.6876927455395495
Endurance improvement was measured on the last comparable submaximal intensity step, expressed by reduction of heart rate and lactate concentration by 10 and 21.5 %, respectively, improvement of lung function regarding FEV 1 and FCV by 12.9 and 11.3 %, respectively, and VC IN 11.4 %.	0.6425229736464525
The relative count of natural killer cells increased by 27.2 %, and the GLQI improved from 109 points (pathologic) to 129 points (normal).	0.5868474372666654
Conclusion: There were positive effects on muscular and cardial mechanisms of adaptation and on illness-related quality of life.	0.5813487394811798

Material and Methods: Since 1993, a total of 249 patient have undergone a nephrectomy for benign renal disease.	0.5281485276460295
In 131 patients a laparoscopic nephrectomy (in most cases via a transperitoneal approach) was performed and in 118 patients an open nephrectomy via a flank incision.	0.7080624254688876
Clinical parameters were compared between both groups as well as with respect to different age groups.	0.5406724840457776
Results: There were no differences in terms of operative results (operative time, pre- and postoperative hemoglobin) between the laparoscopy group and open nephrectomy group as well as among the different age groups.	0.7316130106682094
Patients in the laparoscopy group demonstrated significant advantages with respect to blood loss, transfusion rate, analgesic consumption, hospital stay, and convalescence.	0.6505136072711676
These advantages were not related to patient age.	0.36310141933759277
The complication rate was comparable for both groups; however, both groups showed an elevation of the complication rate in the age groups 75 to 84 years.	0.6749584093620515
The mortality rate within the first 30 days after nephrectomy was 1.7% in the open nephrectomy group.	0.8081501084439137
Conclusions: The laparoscopic nephrectomy offers comparable operative results (with less blood loss and a lower transfusion rate) when compared to open nephrectomy.	0.7522182814985867
In terms of postoperative parameters, patients in the laparoscopy group have significant advantages.	0.7209667253266677
Especially geriatric patients benefit from these advantages and, therefore, the laparoscopic approach should be the preferred technique for a nephrectomy in these patients.	0.6334952749988713
The vast majority of adder bites among children in Germany is caused by the common viper (vipera berus).	0.46331519835982
The venom that is applicated by the viper contains several enzymes, some of them with hemorrhagic and neurotoxic activity.	0.4846918428429266
Adder bites among children may be without any symtoms but as well may cause severe intoxication.	0.42942102259187664
The aim of this study was to evaluate the results after open Bankart repair using suture anchors in patients with recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability.	0.5647664563688598
Some 32 patients were prospectively observed for a mean of 40 months (24-60) after stabilization.	0.8203639531133274
The mean age at the time of operation was 29.7 years.	0.7407919159941149
All patients were postoperatively immobilized in a sling for 3 weeks.	0.5493251313162882
According to the criteria of Rowe, 29 patients (90.6 %) had good or excellent results.	0.7675849014712425
Two patients (6.3 %) developed recurrent instability 6-24 months postoperatively; 93.7 % were not or only slights limited in sports activities.	0.7706880428831354
Bankart repair is an excellent treatment for recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability.	0.478487198199782
The use of suture anchors is an appropriate way of reattaching the capsuloligamentous complex to the glenoid to restore stability to an unstable joint.	0.45887895343507473
Purpose: Assessment of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patency with computed tomography methods has been demonstrated as an alternative to coronary angiography.	0.6876483933219502
The evaluation of the bypass anastomoses is still of limited success.	0.47294432950316406
Prospective ECG triggering of conventional CT scanners al- lows heart phase-triggered single-slice acquisition in the sub-second range.	0.38394701835244
The goal of this study was to evaluate whether the use of ECG triggering can optimize the evaluation of proximal CABG anastomoses.	0.6081056203051477
Multiple personality is known since last century und has been described by Breuer and Freud as well as by Kraepelin.	0.5192357582638097
In the latest and nearly exclusively angloamerican literature multiple personality disorder is included in the dissociated reactions in borderline personality disorder.	0.4132964755252581
The concept of comorbidity is criticized.	0.3093730125043944
Case studies illustrate indications for diagnosing MPD.	0.27438886864128315
The authors point out, that sufficient diagnostic methods and criteria are still not existing.	0.7095115949320229
But their development has its limits: In most cases a history of sexual abuse can be detected and therefore an intensive diagnostic "investigation" can be on a psychodynamic level a repetition of traumatic abuse.	0.5754288698764976
Many new methods have been introduced in reproductive medicine in recent years, and some have already found their way into clinical routine.	0.6353925315674558
Cryopreservation of oocytes and in vitro maturation and culture of primordial follicles do not play a significant role in patient treatment.	0.530522781108019
However, the short-term culture of oocytes before metaphase II does seem relevant.	0.5472158429147376
Blastocyst culture has mostly replaced coculture techniques and, given appropriate laws, provides adequate possibility of selecting embryos with high developmental and implantation potential.	0.418739729771554
An exact pronuclear diagnosis also has a high ability to predict the probability of implantation.	0.5551841056639453
Viewing the latest data, assisted hatching seems to bring no improvements for most patients.	0.38164602940914033
Preimplantation diagnosis is being discussed in Germany due to new statements from ethical committees.	0.43540889289247064
Cytoplasma transfer, nuclear transfer, or the transplantation of spermatogenic cells into donors are currently only experimental.	0.5587002126091647
The importance of spiral-CT is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors.	0.3581899904451724
Its importance for follow-up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors.	0.3837829580115184
Using spiral-CT multiple signs of alterations (n = 98) can be diagnosed, which are not only important for tumour relapse, but also for assessment.	0.6852624418071055
Spiral-CT offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy.	0.4047550707548655
In follow-up examinations after radiation, laryngoscopy and spiral-CT are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath-holding technique (separately reconstructed) and also as functional spiral-CT of the vocal cords in "I"-phonation.	0.4601500446277371
In the years 1980-1992 surveys were undertaken to ascertain the occurrence of central nervous system infections in children in pediatric departments in the German provinces of Bavaria and Lower Saxony.	0.57666348824243
There was a very noticeable drop in viral meningitides over the survey years especially in mumps meningitis, i. e. from 199/205 in 1980 to 16/7 in 1992.	0.4627887642201472
In both states about 80 % of the viral meningitides could not be clarified etiologically.	0.6434107371687183
Whereas in Bavaria a steady increase in herpes simplex encephalitides and varizella zoster encephalitides was apparent (1/4 in 1980, 10/24 in 1992), the same development was not found in Lower Saxony.	0.6527515943809916
Although the number of measles encephalitides dropped in both states during the period of the survey, up to 6 cases of the illness occurred annually.	0.6809146164883456
Only in the case of herpes simplex encephalitis the rate of recovery shows a substantial improvement over the observation period, while for other forms the rate of partial recovery has remained approximately the same.	0.6375810942783705
Purpose: To assess patient reliability and compliance, most perimeters check for false-positive and -negative answers.	0.760721801417867
In this study the results of catch trials were obtained with video campimetry with respect to age-related changes and differences for tests using increment and decrement stimuli.	0.642753251010884
During a 7-year period (between July 1987 and June 1994) 19 patients were treated for Chopart dislocation.	0.7235671577980983
Seventeen patients were examined clinically 48 months following trauma.	0.6608939930477493
We found 1 excellent, 6 good, 6 mediocre, and 4 poor results.	0.7657142326543293
Only 4 patients were able to achieve their pre-accident level of work and no patients could return to sports at the same level.	0.515782594199959
In our patients, Chopart dislocation had a negative social consequence both at the work place and in recreational activities.	0.48812755567261834
In long-term follow-up, the Chopart dislocation was the most debilitating injury even for polytrauma patients.	0.5593298172292269
For incidents of malignant hyperthermia (MH) outside the hospital, a high number of unrecorded cases must be reckoned with because of an insufficient knowledge of emergency services and poor identification and documentation that make it impossible to classify acute situations under the diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia crisis.	0.5721280963126526
As a result, there are no statistical data in this field, and only case reports with a broad spectrum of suspected trigger mechanisms have been published.	0.8108555697439317
The case described in this report is a proved example of a non-anesthesia-related triggering of MH in a 21-year-old man who had had an anesthetic-induced MH manifestation in childhood, which was confirmed with an in vitro contracture test.	0.7067031097719795
After visiting a restaurant, he became unconscious and convulsive after consuming a high level of alcohol (2.9permil).	0.5098016682229929
The first cardiocirculatory arrest occurred directly before hospitalization.	0.2710009443997922
After admission, the patient showed a full-blown MH episode whose subsequent fatality was unavoidable in spite of adapted and optimal therapy.	0.5844882376569642
Suspected trigger mechanisms seem to be multifactoral (excessive alcohol consumption, over-heating, mental stress) as a forensic investigation did not point to any particular signs of typical trigger substances.	0.54941824728788
The case demonstrates again that an MH attack might be triggered under certain non-anaesthesia-related situations.	0.39309533724006135
For patients with an MH disposition, additional information on their behavior outside the hospital is required.	0.7119133014069947
Dipterous fly maggots of different species live worldwide as parasites in hoofed mammals.	0.21967797920497958
In the host the larval development causes typical boils, i. e., abscesses including the larvae.	0.3946626563815374
As a result of increasing tourist traffic, travelers can also bring back to Germany tropical types of myiasis.	0.372945498956601
Surgical treatment of diffuse peritonitis is applied very variably.	0.5027887847896281
There is no question that source control is the most important treatment principle, but the role of additional treatment concepts such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage remains controversial.	0.7584622717611623
In a prospective survey (1993-1996) we analyzed the need for additional treatment concepts in our patient material.	0.8750981061012763
In 186 patients with diffuse peritonitis we applied the concept of source control and extensive (20-30 l) intraoperative lavage.	0.5670730755701782
Additional treatment principles such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage (n = 17) or staged lavage (n = 5) were applied only "on demand", namely in 20 patients (11 %).	0.6447629520389596
In 166 patients (89 %) source control of diffuse peritonitis was possible.	0.5672463208197193
The mean severity of peritonitis (n = 186) was 28.5 (range 16-43) using the Mannheim Peritonitis Index.	0.8766167288739036
The primary cause of peritonitis in our patients was perforation or leakage in the lower GI tract (52 %).	0.5852486756733207
The hospital mortality rate was 12 % in the whole group, and the postoperative morbidity rate was 34 %.	0.9637220645884894
We conclude that nowadays, using high-quality intensive care as well as modern antiinfective treatment, only a few patients (ca.	0.7941414885237029
10 %) need additional therapy measures such as postoperative lavage.	0.4470620969474711
Surgical source control in combination with intraoperative lavage is sufficient in most of the patients with diffuse peritonitis.	0.7808007701318024
Native Tissue Harmonic Imaging is a new way of ultrasound image processing that addresses the difficult-to-image patient.	0.4756199854361654
By using a Gaussian shaped transmit pulse it is possible to separate from the returning echo the harmonic component without overlapping with fundamental reflections.	0.42767650492463083
The improved image quality leads to higher diagnostic confidence so that the use of further imaging modalitites is unnecessary.	0.4287665987282832
Aim: The aim of this study was to validate the detection of calcified arteriosclerotic plaques with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).	0.48924564490630856
Method: 181 arteries were examined by 20/30 MHz IVUS.	0.4657608545987671
The ultrasound cross-sections were compared to the corresponding radiologic (30 kV) and histologic cross-sections.	0.7552482816805809
Results: Calcified lesions were imaged as bright echos with shadowing.	0.34582611450545164
In 13 cases of 161 calcified lesions were too small to detect by IVUS.	0.5317829722309583
In 5 ultrasonic sections the diagnosis "calcified lesion" could not be verified neither by radiology nor by histology.	0.4575150187994098
The sensitivity was 91.6%, the specificity was 94.7% and the accuracy was 93.0%.	0.7821927049415381
Conclusions: Because of the acoustic properties of calcium, calcified lesions can be detected accurately by IVUS.	0.5658981344533275
IVUS can generate new insights into the effect of plaque composition on the response to catheter therapies.	0.45726808247487405
Hillel Klein has called the holocaust "the dark core of the twentieth century".	0.3829698092225293
It was the aim of weekly conferences, held in Israel in 1994 and 1996, to explore its repercussions on current behaviour.	0.5447933865322248
The topic was "The past in the present".	0.7639566267539236
The participants were Israelis and Germans, the staff international.	0.4336326624774747
The method used was the application of the "group relations conference", specially devised for these conferences.	0.47488717107819195
The leadership was in the hands of Eric J. Miller, director of the group relations program at the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London, where this group method originated and continues to be particularly cultivated still today.	0.49909960539196274
It is especially suited when an unconscious conflict between subgroups exists that emerges on the surface in forms which lead to confusion and misunderstandings.	0.4555168191350942
The task which had been put to the participants was as follows: to explore how feelings and fantasies influence relations within and between the two groups.	0.5650786400146712
This was easy to remember but not always easy to adhere to.	0.4544342294001928
There were moments when fantasy and reality got confused, accompanied by intense feelings.	0.2535255487441531
In this paper my experience with a databank for cases with bone diseases is reported.	0.5966552442660606
All cases which had been diagnosed in the newly formed Department of Bone Pathology of the University of Hamburg since 1970 were registered in uniform fashion.	0.6399107817561103
Adapting the system to state-of-the-art network structures required a lot of personal and financial investment.	0.41657811960391444
This could not be accomplished by university resources alone, but only in cooperation with other research funds.	0.6987869979328896
Now 76 000 cases can be routinely accessed and scientifically analysed.	0.2795982705137469
Background and purpose: In Germany, 750,000 children are born per year who should be screened for developmental visual defects in the age range 24-48 months.	0.5176792591747938
However, the established pediatric screening program is not sufficient to prevent amblyopia.	0.6885653728172378
The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of alternatives for amblyopia and microtropia screening.	0.5417176510577592
The fluorescence diagnosis based on the aminolavulinic acid-stimulated porphyrin synthesis allows the detection of superficial tumors in a very early stage even when they are very small tumors.	0.5086479394659087
A fluorescence diagnosis of tumors in the oral cavity can be simply performed by rinsing with a 0.4% ALA solution for 20 min.	0.5465567498588647
This topical application avoids systemic side effects such as skin sensitization.	0.31933316525986455
The red fluorescent areas are visible to the naked eye; only a blue light source for fluorescence excitation is necessary and a suitable red filter for observation.	0.5145993735856974
In our study on 56 patients suffering from carcinoma of the oral cavity, 96% of the histologically confirmed carcinoma could be visualized via fluorescence.	0.612310430491704
In 3 patients additional tumors were detected via fluorescence that were not visible otherwise.	0.48213094159510445
However, many patients show fluorescent areas with no correlation to the histological finding.	0.6340261621924851
It was verified that bacteria from the oral cavity also produce PpIX after ALA incubation, which leads to false-positive findings.	0.5366944257736644
Reduction of the false-positive findings was achieved by rinsing the oral cavity with hydrogen peroxide and by mechanical plaque reduction.	0.6038176080063069
This improves the reliability of a fluorescence-guided biopsy.	0.4032113741505382
However, suppression of the bacteria fluorescence is necessary for clinical use of this diagnostic method.	0.7782518226513608
Autocapture is a newly developed automatic threshold tracking algorithm implemented in implantable pacemakers.	0.3529544948640196
Based on the detection of the cardiac evoked response, autocapture continuously controls the effectiveness of stimulation.	0.628459426531548
Increases in threshold are immediately followed by an adaption of the pulse amplitude.	0.41303287526668525
Automatic threshold tests periodically lower the amplitude in order to adapt to decreased thresholds.	0.3515684893563471
Thus, changes in threshold can be monitored over a long period and utilized as a diagnostic tool.	0.5855376495477003
This case report demonstrates the diagnosis and monitoring of a microdislodgement by means of autocapture.	0.7135750803079511
The indication to treat symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is discussed controversely.	0.49680796441366765
Successful medical treatment may result in the reduction of symptoms by improving hemodynamics in a reduction of thromboembolic events.	0.6292226437952562
However, several antiarrhythmic drugs are also known to increase the risk of proarrhythmic events.	0.6988430972659658
Tissue engineering offers the possibility to fabricate living substitutes for tissues and organs by combining histogenic cells and biocompatible carrier materials.	0.40728218639045866

The fabrication of bone and cartilage constructs, their combinations and gene therapeutic approaches are demonstrated.	0.6170057563447464
Advantages and disadvantages of these methods are described by in vitro and in vitro testing.	0.6404729490959509
The proof of histotypical function after implantation in vivo is essential.	0.3523928714343894
The use of autologous cells and tissue engineering methods offers the possibility to overcome the disadvantages of classical tissue reconstruction - donor site morbidity of autologous grafts, immunogenicity of allogenic grafts and loosening of alloplastic implants.	0.555284179354796
Furthermore, tissue engineering widens the spectrum of surgical indications in bone and cartilage reconstruction.	0.5739770544224346
The purpose of this paper is to present principle and technique of proximal lateral column lengthening by calcaneal osteotomy and to critically analyze our preliminary results.	0.5520094999806289
16 patients (7 female, 9 male; average age 52.3 years [24-72 years]) were treated for stage II to III posterior tibial tendon insufficiency by calcaneal osteotomy and medial soft tissue reconstruction (tendon reconstruction, 15; tendon transfer, 8; deltoid ligament repair, 10).	0.7260823576174066
When the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Rating Scale was applied, these patients were shown to have significantly increased their scores from an average preoperative value of 49.1 to a mean postoperative value of 91.1 after a mean follow-up of 24.6 months.	0.7117835999563517
In all but one case no loss of achieved foot correction was noted.	0.3807381259578014
In one case, a fusion of the calcaneocuboid joint had to be performed after 5 months due to painful degenerative joint disease.	0.7548427438704581
At follow-up, all patients had satisfactory restoration of their medial longitudinal arch, reduction of forefoot abduction, and restored arch height.	0.6679447819308604
All patients were able to fully weight-bear the operated foot, and all patients were satisfied with the achieved result.	0.6338745068018019
In the pes planovalgus deformity occurring in stage II to III (as significant degenerative joint disease has not already occurred), osteotomies appear to have a significant role in the operative management and to function by restoring more normal biomechanics, thus allowing tendon reconstruction and tendon transfers to return to successfull function.	0.6267455131227816
By the update of §24 a of the German road traffic act driving under the influence of drugs of abuse can now be fined even in absence of an actual driving impairment.	0.475651821552982
The only requisite is the detection of certain drugs/metabolites in a blood sample.	0.5019646999961465
Therefore for pretesting there is a need for fast and reliable immunological screening methods in blood/serum.	0.4379325704126443
The new Mahsan microtiterplate enzyme immunoassay (MTP-EIA) is claimed to be sensitive and independent of the matrix.	0.5650515159054538
For an evaluation we carried out a comparison of the cannabinoid and opiate assays from Mahsan (MTP-EIA) and the routinely used Abbott fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) with a batch of routine serum samples.	0.5900012821425156
For the MTP-EIAs we used the cut-off recommendations of the supplier (cannabinoids 2 ng/mL, opiates 10 ng/mL).	0.48659213841964777
For the Abbott FPIAs the serum samples had to be pretreated (deproteinization with acetone) and appropriate cut-offs were defined by our investigations (cannabinoids 20 ng/mL, opiates 30 ng/mL).	0.505069694020283
Out of 136 samples screened for cannabinoids 42% were positive with GC-MS and 18% from 123 samples were positive for opiates.	0.6071323765942348
The Abbott cannabinoid FPIA gave false negative results in 23% of GC-MS positive cases and 9% false negatives for opiates while Mahsan MTP-EIA gave no false negatives.	0.5090562417515653
Each of the two cannabinoid assays gave false positive results in 13% of the cases and for the MTP opiate assay 2% of the positives could not be confirmed with GC-MS. As a result of our study the cut-off values for the MTP-EIAs have proved to be suitable for a distinction between potential positives and true negatives.	0.802208267161983
Systemic karyomegaly associated with interstitial nephritis was first described in 1978 by Mihatsch.	0.36452476265025113
Seven cases have been reported to date.	0.7782296193006184
We give an account of an autopsy case of systemic karyomegaly in a 30-year-old Italian man.	0.4713835699523049
Bizarre enlargement of nuclei was found in renal tubular epithelial cells, Schwann cells and in smooth muscle cells of vessels and bowel and, less obviously, in endothelial and adventitial cells of vessels, in alveolar epithelial cells and in astrocytes of the brain.	0.7117471117485293
These findings were associated with chronic interstitial nephritis, nonspecific hepatopathy, adenocarcinoma of the rectum and multiple slerosis.	0.6713389545445354
The clinical course was marked by chronic renal failure, chronic haemodialysis and renal transplantation.	0.7246001757102672
The patient died 8 years after diagnosis in septic-toxic shock.	0.7166173691384004
The aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease are discussed.	0.8710127668204309
17% of malignant melanomas (n=100) investigated in a dermatologic practice were less than 6 mm in maximal diameter (median diameter: 4.0 +/- 0.9 mm).	0.7545590726302908
The median age of the 17 patients at diagnosis of small-diameter melanomas was 42 years.	0.6923178545125427
The essential epiluminescence microscopic and histopatologic features of these small melanomas resembled those of larger lesions, although their clinical criteria differed from the classic ABCDs.	0.534402493623047
6 (35,3%) of the small melanomas were were found to be in situ.	0.9378796711980454
This percentage was nearly similar to those in situ lesions within the group of melanomas of 6 mm in diameter or larger (38,3%).	0.5874542104848859
The remaining 11 small lesions were classified as invasive from Clark's level I to V, including all classic histogenetic types (superficial spreading, nodular, unclassified, desmoplastic).	0.4592827980680137
The median thickness of the small invasive melanomas was 0,76 +/- 0,23 mm.	0.6670269788869836
7 small melanomas had apparent histologic remnants of a melanocytic nevus.	0.2768032862993835
Epiluminescence microscopic features of the melanomas were evaluated and statistically compared with those of 100 dysplastic nevi and 50 spindle cell nevi.	0.4778715097664173
The technique of epiluminescence microscopy allowed the identification of such malignant melanomas that could not be discerned by the naked eye or by a pocket-lens.	0.5067526251228289
Mycobacterium gordonae is an atypical mycobacterium of very low pathogenic potential.	0.3057573097699611
It is widely distributed in soil and water and often detected on the mucous membranes of healthy persons.	0.3602902002442282
In recent years, there have been numerous reports of infections by M. gordonae in immunocompromised patients.	0.5922975648970501
In contrast, only four cases of skin infections by M. gordonae in immunocompetent patients have been published.	0.6592849854931169
We report on another patient without evidence of immunodeficiency who developed an atypical mycobacteriosis after a thorn injury during gardening.	0.5283949470158502
M. gordonae was isolated by tissue culture.	0.4410867558252504
The skin lesion cleared completely after treatment with doxycycline for three months.	0.43872687258169274
The article gives a review on oncocytic metaplasia and oncocytic tumors.	0.39137805350491606
Biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic findings are discussed.	0.35103063819668867
It has been established, that defects of the respiratory chain occur predominantly in oncocytic foci of the parathyroids and the liver.	0.6967444064290139
The underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear, however.	0.6650079152535676
In particular, one has to assume that oncocytic metaplasia differs pathogenetically from oncocytic neoplasia.	0.431663490935559
Furthermore, organ-dependent prognostic differences of oncocytic tumors exist.	0.45490930880200303
Oncocytic carcinomas are predominantly seen in the thyroid and are scarce in other organs.	0.541912624464998
The molecular genetic basis of this phenomenon is, however, still unknown.	0.6625856992931138
The authors describe the feasibility of developing receptor-specific MR contrast agents for the improved detection of pathology and assessment of organ function.	0.5099552701797596
Receptor specificity of MR contrast agents can be achieved by binding of receptor-specific carriers to ligands.	0.5822540672662245
This concept leads towards a decrease in dose and thus in toxicity.	0.422233322180227
Specific attachment to parenchymal cells improves tumor-organ contrast and therefore tumor detection.	0.3072813107593186
Specific uptake mechanisms also enable the assessment of organ function.	0.2936014893582146
Future design concepts of novel MR contrast agents may consider the desired uptake in specific cells or organs (ovaries, adrenal glands, lymph nodes etc.)	0.42439027430626214
with subsequent synthesis of appropriate carriers.	0.2931815718206708
Elastosis perforans serpiginosa can arise as a rare complication in patients with Down syndrome.	0.5019100969603235
It is one of the primary perforating disorders characterized by transepithelial elimination of abnormal elastic fibers.	0.4655292756121982
This may reflect an immunological reaction aquist elastic fibers.	0.2603797528130841
We describe a 40-year-old woman with Down's syndrome whose skin lesions were histologically mistaken for lupus vulgaris for a long time.	0.5161374385741065
The position of the talus and the os calcaneum has consequences for the architecture of the forefoot.	0.620121392952519
Medial tilting of the talus with vertical position provokes flattening of the medial arch and abduction of the forefoot.	0.583684040887262
Varus position of the calcis and lateral direction of the talus (as in residual clubfoot), however, causes supination and adduction of the forefoot.	0.6143963454010146
Repair of deformities in the hindfoot therefore also influences the forefoot.	0.3359809095459971
A large number of various osteotomies have been proposed at both bones.	0.4119970753387729
The most popular ones are Dwyer's osteotomy at the corpus of the calcis and its modification described by Mitchell at the same location for correction of the cavus foot and the residual clubfoot, and the lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to Evans.	0.5624782282045997
Indication and operative technique of these three procedures are described in detail.	0.7194804446765402
The closing wedge osteotomy according to Dwyer is indicated in cases of cavus feet.	0.40950713243516257
In clubfeet the os calcis is usually too short and the medial opening wedge osteotomy provokes skin problems.	0.38769623043298335
In these cases an osteotomy according to Mitchell with lateral displacement of the tuber calcanei is more suitable.	0.5018043061257904
In flat- and skewfeet a lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to Evans can be indicated, especially when the load of the foot is bigger medially under the talus rather than at the lateral margin of the foot.	0.6490995858221027
If these procedures are carried out carefully, they have low complications rates.	0.5262016336454743
Between January 1994 and August 1998, 12 patients with 13 chronic infections after resection arthroplasty were treated successfully with vastus lateralis muscleflap.	0.5217482158357465
One patient was suffering from chronic infection on both sides.	0.5758339715387368
In all cases we found the infected cavity to be the origin of the persistent infection.	0.8820247086817213
The average duration of infection was 8.3 months.	0.6668580282982021
The patients had undergone an average of 3.8 operations.	0.9394702012166021
Up to now there was no recurrent infection, controlled by clinical investigation, ultrasound and laboratory findings in all 13 cases.	0.7759975691383804
Follow up investigation occured 2.5 years (1.5-4.7) after flap transfer.	0.9416794175954197
The flap is easy to harvest.	0.2881674173930115
He has a very constant pattern of vascular pedicle and a wide arc of rotation.	0.4226501068254683
The functional deficits of donor side morbidity are minimal.	0.40576847861670906
That vastus lateralis flap seems to be an ideal procedure to stop draining infections due to infected cavities in the hip region.	0.5337941142753723
Information technologies have been integrated in gynecological oncology treatment and, therefore, new software has been established in hospitals and private clinics.	0.5861668895436508
A German law for hospital tumor registration has attempted to unify the different strategies.	0.33109832433284997
All intentions to establish new documentation systems for tumor diseases need a standardized basic data set.	0.3310416057373874
Nevertheless, local governmental health organizations are not yet prepared to implement a global information system such as prenatal and perinatal care databases.	0.4930175501341541
Financial support and political work is therefore needed.	0.3410860677743406
To optimise the microsurgical training in our clinic we organized a permanent possibility to practice microsurgical techniques of vascular anastomosis.	0.43149612189518144
This includes stepwise education by means of plastic materials, human placenta and the rat model.	0.45974043344109866
The most important role in this concept is played by the placenta.	0.7615538405345788
It supplies a realistic simulation of different in vivo situations concerning microvascular anastomosis.	0.30419482514006047
As to availability, handling and costs the placenta is superior to animal models and has replaced them almost completely in our educational concept.	0.43382123313779836
Since Manfred Bleuler's description of the clinical picture of late onset schizophrenia over 50 years ago, debate has persisted as to whether it is justifiable to differentiate this as a valid, independent entity from the group of classic schizophrenic disorders with early onset.	0.6387029160652272
As this review shows, this question cannot be answered unequivocally even now.	0.5501073864061151
It must rather be remarked that we have neither been able to decisively extend our knowledge since Manfred Bleuler's comprehensive contribution, nor managed to achieve a much sounder basis methodologically.	0.42575032493708176
The reasons for this are the international conceptual and terminological confusion that has developed around this illness group, and on the other hand the methodological limitations of the empirical studies conducted on this clinical picture so far.	0.617378898756707
Definition of the problem: In parallel with public and philosophical discussions, there is an ongoing debate about euthanasia in theological ethics.	0.5688600178081628
In this situation it is helpful to provide a systematic overview of the different arguments and judgements.	0.7022693247848556
Arguments: A short introduction is followed by a first part dealing with the definition of terms.	0.7632697175627827
The second and major part concerning normative arguments is subdivided into three steps: the level of principles, the more concrete level of actions and finally the level of social consequences.	0.6174129055253622
The third part presents some reflections following the eudaimonistic ethical tradition (the ethics of a good life and death) focusing on the central question: how to find meaning in life when faced with suffering.	0.5382161631506108
Conclusion: It would be fruitful to intensify the ethical reflection both on the problems concerning the foundations of social life, especially the meaning of dignity, autonomy and inviolability of human life, and social consequences of a liberal practice of euthanasia.	0.6005062917626279
In this context ethicists are challenged to reflect on the different approaches to what is or can be a good life and a human death.	0.5603688973835527
Multimodal therapy of oral squamous cell carcinomas today is based on surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.	0.6248867211528428
Despite the combination of all three therapeutic options, there is still a large number of treatment failures and therefore major questions remain.	0.6102014250017603
Recent investigations suggest that mutations of the p53 tumor supressor gene may account for some of the therapeutic failures.	0.5530939948632014
Inactivation of the gene may be an  important determinant of the efficiacy of today's multimodal therapy protocols.	0.5082546405334308
In 90 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity biopsy specimens were taken before and after preoperative radiochemotherapy.	0.5933235397947793
From all patients, biopsy and resection material was available for immunohistochemical analysis of p53.	0.4528838068128568
After radiation treatment, 51 patients (57%) showed a complete response; 39 patients (43%) only showed a partial response or did not respond at all.	0.7923969235210854
Among the responders, 82% of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive, whereas among the nonresponders only 56% of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive.	0.5920829613593772
The majority of the residual tumors were also p53 negative according to immunohistology after radiation treatment.	0.48371978705366664
In our study, detection of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry seemed to be connected with a more radiosensitive reaction of the tumors.	0.6397455660822347
Nevertheless, successful strategies for radiation therapy may need to take into account the tissue of origin and the status of p53 in the tumor.	0.6915837114428766
The human cartilage and bone is characterized by a remodeling during the life, well balanced by neosynthesis and degradation of matrix components.	0.5607008572095694
In different joint diseases, it becomes imbalanced and the destruction of the cartilage supersedes the repair.	0.6123717617039988
In tissue processes in disease and in normal turnover of the matrix, these molecules are fragmented and released into surrounding fluids, in the synovial fluid, and then in the blood and the urin, where they can be detected.	0.7882305459630291
The quantitative measurement in the synovial fluid is more specific than in the other body fluids.	0.6525376228883711
The research process in recent years has suggested that these molecular markers of cartilage and bone matrix metabolism can be used to determine diagnosis, the disease severity rather than its presence or absence, the prognosis, and the response to therapy.	0.8258202209427555
They should help to identify the disease mechanism in different joint diseases not only on the tissue but also on the molecular level.	0.6408290129386008
The specific cartilage matrix markers promise to become useful tools in the future in clinical use.	0.5823733864371723
The research in this area is still in the early stages, with most results dated from the end of the 1980s and the 1990s.	0.7730433754878353
Axillary block is a common anaesthetic technique for operations on the hand and forearm.	0.6706838428205089
In our hospital, with many trainees in anaesthesia, only 250 - 300 axillary blocks per year are performed by about 30 colleagues.	0.7316745986802985
This implies a small number of blocks for each anaesthetist.	0.3548968780840958
The present study was designed to assess whether it is possible to teach this technique and use it with an adequate degree of success under these conditions.	0.6719028160217625
We used a nerve stimulator and studied whether the success of the block under these conditions is independent of anaesthetist's experience in this technique.	0.5677596997455066
Furthermore, we examined other factors involved in the success of the block.	0.8728367024590716
The study included 112 patients subjected to elective surgery of the upper extremity; all received an axillary block.	0.6386984699342848
We used a nerve stimulator and injected mepivacaine 1% without adrenaline.	0.4420439015908119
The following parameters were recorded: the number of blocks to date performed by the anaesthetist; the minimal current required for nerve stimulation; the dose of local anaesthetic; the time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery; the duration of surgery; and the quality of sensory and motor blockade after 10, 20, and 30 min.	0.8434089976481232
Sensory blockade was assessed by the pinprick method (no blockade, analgesia, anaesthesia); motor blockade was judged by comparing the muscle strength of both arms (no blockade, paresis, paralysis).	0.5499565935675241
Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test, with P<0.05 considered statistically significant.	0.6645450372718901
Of the 112 blocks, 95 (85%) were successful; 17 (15%) failed and the patients required general anaesthesia.	0.7613443856444533
Eight of the successful blocks showed a decrease in analgesic quality after >=70 min and required additional analgesics or general anaesthesia.	0.4582632298546961
We found no correlation between the experience of the anaesthetist and the success of the block.	0.6998116647258018
The minimal required current for nerve stimulation in the success group was 0.4 mA and differed significantly from the value of 0.6 mA in the failure group (Table 3).	0.6392908876421018
The dose of mepivacaine was higher in the success group (5.9 vs. 5.3 mg/kg).	0.9045776061804537
Complete sensory blockade was more frequently achieved for the median, ulnar, and radial nerves than for the musculocutaneous and cutaneous brachii medialis (Fig.	0.4865725836564411
The frequency of complete sensory blockade (anaesthesia) had increased by 21.9% between the 20th and 30th min.	0.6405090414966215
Complete motor blockade was less often achieved than sensory blockade (Fig.	0.3263052766901092
Using the method of electrostimulation, the axillary block is an appropriate anaesthetic technique that can be applied in a hospital where each anaesthetist only occasionally performs it.	0.7529831801095433
Prior to injection of the local anaesthetic, the current for nerve stimulation should be reduced to <0.5 mA.	0.8749262913376568
The time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery should be no less than 30 min because complete sensory blockade can more often be achieved.	0.5049393396625019
The dose of mepivacaine should be no less than 6 mg/kg body weight.	0.5686833826030974
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was discovered 10 years ago as a growth factor that can regulate angiogenesis and in addition the permeability of blood vessels.	0.6150125341735919
Numerous studies have revealed that it is essential for normal embryonic development and that it plays a major role in physiological and pathological events of angiogenesis in adults.	0.6585788567668248
It is unique in that its expression is regulated directly by hypoxia.	0.3452539726090206
These properties are now being exploited in attempts aimed at the induction of new blood vessels in pathological situations such as ischemic heart disease.	0.4314370344815676
Five VEGF forms of 121 to 206 amino-acids are produced from a single gene by alternative splicing.	0.38066853909108456
Cells expressing VEGF usually express several forms simultaneously.	0.20268971770361652
VEGF121 does not contain exons 6 and 7 of the gene and consequently lacks a heparin binding ability.	0.47991243846765835
However, this form is fully  active as an inducer of angiogenesis, and as a blood vessel permeabilizing agent.	0.7373811084385592
Exon 6 and 7 contain 2 independent heparin binding domains.	0.3687272140060575
The VEGF form containing exon 7 (VEGF165) and the vascular endothelial growth factor form containing exon 6 (VEGF145) display similar biological potencies raising the question of why so many VEGF forms are required.	0.5862625295305849
It was found that VEGF121 diffuses better because it does not bind to heparan-sulfate proteoglycans.	0.4209549563032157
In contrast, VEGF145 binds to extracellular matrix ad is released from it slowly.	0.29167422046989266
When the receptor binding properties of VEGF121 and VEGF165 were compared it was found that VEGF165 binds to a class of VEGF receptors that is not recognized by VEGF121.	0.46901726980648406
These receptors are encoded by the neuropilin-1 gene, and we have recently found that the related neuropilin-2 gene also encodes a VEGF165 receptor.	0.5851284396490822
We have recently found evidence indicating the neuropilins form complexes with another VEGF receptor, VEGFR-1.	0.33747895109603404
However, the biological function of this complex remains to be elucidated.	0.665041302124922
In addition to mucositis and myelotoxicity as well known early reactions after radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy in advanced head and neck tumors, late toxicity following treatment is an often underestimated problem.	0.5566053205989147
The healing of wounds by secondary  intention is a simple method to close  operative defects.	0.5766568554231876
The quality of wound healing will depend on the anatomic site on the face as well as on size and depth of the  defect.	0.7150396001534708
Best functional and cosmetic results are obtained at locations with concave  geometry and when the defect lies  symmetrically at the interface of two  anatomic subunits.	0.478392559510059
Partial reconstruction or guiding sutures can create a symmetric  defect in relation to anatomic subunits which will heal by second intention.	0.34152468185195606
This simple and efficient operative procedure is ilustrated by two case reports.	0.40466821221993854
Background: Acute infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a selflimiting lymphoproliferative disease of EBV-infected (immortalised) B cells and poly-/oligoclonal cytotoxic T cells which are to a high percentage EBV-specific.	0.5875670351034592
In B cells EBV infection mainly leads to a latent infection with expression of EBV nuclear antigens 1-6 (EBNA1-6) and membrane antigens 1, 2A and 2B (LMP1, LMP2A and LMP2B).	0.5393357754286946
Expression of these EBV latent antigens leads to transformation and immortalisation of infected B cells.	0.2992343077388926
Here we examined if also lytic EBV genes (i.e.	0.2869675334451752
BZLF1), which are associated with a productive EBV infection, are expressed during IM.	0.7862561821568129
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a frequent underlying disease in young patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and sudden death.	0.6882747204239164
Treatment is frequently indicated and is mainly directed at the prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death.	0.5154672839139813
In a minority of patients with progressive ARVCM and clinical signs of heart failure, pharmacological treatment with vasodilators, diuretics, and digitalis may be required.	0.6610037618999027
A prospective study was performed to compare the sensitivity and accuracy of ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) as a bone scan to detect subclinical invasion of the mandible by squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and floor of mouth.	0.7480391635294348
The typical clinical features of myasthenia gravis are weakness and excessive fatiguability of striated muscles that increases during the course of the day or after strenous exercise.	0.5703786072324547
Ocular muscle involvement with ptosis (in 50%) and diplopia (in 25%) are the most common initial signs.	0.8795147746246255
The disease can progress to bulbar muscles and to all other striated muscles (generalized myasthenia).	0.45218088819192215
The muscle fatiguability and a fluctuating course can mislead to a diagnosis of neurasthenia.	0.3870533265886645
Since the treatment of myasthenia gravis is directed at the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease an early diagnosis is of great significance for the course of the disease.	0.8237519073717443
Also, a false positive diagnosis of myasthenia has to be avoided because of the potentially hazardous side effects of the therapy.	0.8410949305476004
The mainstay of the diagnosis is the history and a subtle clinical examination with tests of excessive muscle fatiguability.	0.7242670216801439
The injection of edrophonium (Tensilon), the electrodiagnostic testing after repitive stimulation (decrement test) and the testing for serum antibodies against acetylcholin receptors have to be performed to secure the diagnosis of myasthenia.	0.7092861927086441
The edrophonium test and the decrement test can yield false positive results in other neuromuscular diseases.	0.4394798589084452
Antibodies are present in 50% of ocular myasthenia and in 80-90% of the generalized form.	0.6719319021902294
The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, other neuromuscular diseases, mitochondrial diseases, diseases of the cranial nerves, botulism and the rare congenital myasthenic syndromes have to be considered as differential diagnosis.	0.6109786428737485
The application of biodegradable implants is combined with advantages and disadvan- tages.	0.3745852679932124
They offer a great deal of innovative ideas.	0.36461792551207767
Best evaluation has been done with pins for the fixation of low loaded osteochondral fractures.	0.42895682107174865
When using 2,7 mm Polypin primary mechanical stabilility of distal radius fractures is comparable with the fixation by 1,8 mm K-wires.	0.4732585935381403
A prospective and randomised study with two years follow up, including 183 radial head fractures, showed no significant difference in results and complications in metal and polyactide implants.	0.772004654986341
For this localisation and other comparable indications the implant can be recommended.	0.47701292050924393
Despite the more extensive degradable device overall costs can be reduced with the polymer implant.	0.4568933613413903
Orien- truded polyactide screws showed good clinical results, newetheless resorption was extremely late within 5 to 7 years.	0.3674557927704392
The treatment of deep cartilage defects is a challenge for every orthopeadic surgeon.	0.6039326616409875
The potention for regeneration of cartilage tissue is minimal and leads to mechanically inferior fibrous tissue.	0.32121441900307346
The established techniques induce the growth of fibrous tissue but fail to prevent arthrosis.	0.4422940664445752
Autologous chondrocyte transplantation seems to be the most promising therapy concept with clinical relevance to reserves a full thickness cartilage defekt with hyaline-like cartilage.	0.5115589278483885
Outcome studies with a follow up from 2-10 years show in up to 90 % good and excellent results for defects on the femoral condyle and 70 % for the patella.	0.8574680532231651
Mechanical testing of the regenerated cartilage showed almost simular stiffness as nearly normal hyaline cartilage.	0.30118021745790163
The available data justify the acceptance of autologous chondrocyte transplantation as a standard procedure for limited indications and well-trained surgeons.	0.6460330237029879
Result of already inaugurated studies will show the potential of chondrocyte transplantation to prevent osteoarthritis.	0.45763861964805647
Vasculitides are rare diseases characterized by inflammation of blood vessels.	0.5458777376130673
According to diameter of the blood vessels involved in the inflammatory process, the clinical presentation and the histological appearance, different vasculitic syndromes may be distinguished.	0.8849849773127285
Primary vasculitides are of unknown origin while secondary vasculitides may be caused by drugs, malignancy or infection.	0.377064543408825
Panarteriitis nodosa caused by chronic Hepatitis B and mixed cryoglobulinemia secondary to chronic Hepatitis C are classical examples of vasculitides triggered by infections.	0.39834480917641185
However, these are rare complications of chronic viral hepatitis.	0.6918958261640924
Patients infected by HIV frequently suffer from vasculitis, which may be caused by opportunistic infections and by defects in immune regulation.	0.5955495416346533
In numerous case reports, various other infectious particles have been reported to cause different forms of vasculitis, either by direct infection of endothelial cells or by induction of an immunologic process leading to blood vessel destruction.	0.6017469481634917
Immunologically mediated vasculitis secondary to infection may be due to a predisposing reactivity of the patient's immune system.	0.6361572180048626
After successful treatment of the infection, the vasculitis usually subsides.	0.709380565000751
Therefore, all patients with vasculitis should be evaluated for underlying infection.	0.8927340873589638
To calculate canal compromise and decrease of midsagittal diameter caused by retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal we analyzed the pre- and postoperative computed tomographies of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by USS (universal spine system).	0.5758643078047384
Our intention was to examine the efficiency of ultrasound guided repositioning of the dispaced fragments which was performed in all 32 cases.	0.6402867836480292
We found a clear postoperative enlargement of canal area (ASP preoperatively 55 %, postop.	0.5406824479927421
80 %) and midsagittal diameter (MSD preop.	0.6088424245273769
10 of 13 patients presented a postoperative improvement of neurological deficit, no neurological deterioration occured.	0.5712816812738648
Fractures with neurological deficit showed more canal compromise (52 %) and less midsagittal diameter (MSD compromise 51 %) than those without (40 % or 39 %).	0.7194135559891157
There was no correlation between the percentage of spinal canal stenosis and the severity of neurological deficit.	0.6169060030670062
Below L 1 the spinal canal is greater than between Th 11 and L 1, so a more important spinal stenosis is tolerated.	0.6233025072134007
In case of unstable burst fractures with neurological deficit the ultrasound guided spinal fracture reposition is an effective procedure concerning the necessary improvement of spinal stenosis: an additional ventral approach for the revision of the spinal canal is unneeded.	0.611728989880899
In fractures without neurologic deficit the repositioning of the displaced fragments promises an avoidance of long-term damages such as myelopathia and claudicatio spinalis.	0.3643519933389086
In common the traumatic spondylolisthesis is not a life threatening injury.	0.604564789927848
An exact diagnosis is mandatory as well as a differentiated therapy.	0.641575784297838
Especially the correct decision about the therapy (operative vs conservative) including the technical demanding operative procedures is based on an experienced surgeon.	0.7033312574178626
These patients should be transferred to a specialised centre.	0.5205565280395988
The intensity of DNA degradation in fixed tissues is dependent on the fixation solution and the fixation time.	0.6017845468436108
The aim of this study was the investigation of DNA degradation over fixation times of up to 70 days in different tissues (muscle, brain, liver, bone) and with different formalin concentration (2 %, 4 %, 8 %; unbuffered).	0.8141561094810302
An additional test was performed to see whether the fixed tissues could be individualized using PCR analysis.	0.5568026091052136
The smallest amounts of DNA were extracted from liver and brain and the largest from muscle and bone.	0.38597597527135347
The amount of DNA that could be extracted decreased with increasing formalin concentration, while at the same time DNA degradation increased.	0.6303867362867501
With the PCR-VNTR system HUMTH 01, all fixed samples could be typed regardless of the fixation time and the formalin concentration.	0.5403732196936847
The draining sinus is an unpleasant complication of acne conglobata, acne fulminans, acne inversa, rosacea conglobata and rosacea fulminans (pyoderma faciale).	0.3664870718051976
It is most common on the face, especially in the nasolabial folds, and on the neck below the mandibular line.	0.6929447640090813
Clinically, it is an elongated (2-5 cm long), elevated, periodically inflamed lesion, which sporadically discharges pus.	0.7658240810389727
The lesion persists with no tendency to spontaneous regression.	0.3349893829089125
Histopathologically, it consists of elaborate, epithelialized galleries connected to the skin surface at multiple points.	0.6074781783922335
It contains corneocytes, hairs, bacteria, serum, inflammatory cells and epitheloid granulomas.	0.5193641771946423
A surgical thread placed into the skin provides a model in which the generation of sinus tracts can be studied.	0.5791128837219442
Intralesional corticosteroid injection, cryosurgery and isotretinoin are not always very effective.	0.3927522829773323
Sometimes complete excision of the lesion is necessary.	0.7143035821603773
The draining sinus is a special form of scar analogous to the pilonidal cyst.	0.39210230296467585
A thoracic outlet syndrome is only rarely caused by osseous anomalies.	0.30556327997026855
Instead, it is a soft-tissue disease, where the C8 and T1 roots or the proximal inferior trunk of the brachial plexus are compressed by fibromuscular anomalies between the inferior cervical spine and the first rib or pleura.	0.6473004192926904
Thoracic outlet syndrome is a clinical diagnosis.	0.5758165062578094
If surgery is recommended, it should be concentrated on the fibromuscular anomalies and not on the first rib.	0.6824400014967634
Transaxillary removal of the first rib carries an important risk of serious complications.	0.7861112720132625
Among these, brachial plexus injury is the most frequent one.	0.5765891473794142
Objective: The objective of this survey was to investigate the current status of the epidural and intrathecal management in patients with chronic cancer and non-cancer pain in Germany and Austria.	0.8402358564967142
Methods: In June 1997 a questionnaire was sent to 598 German and Austrian anaesthesiologists specialized in pain therapy.	0.4794982956809921
Questions concerning the use of medicaments for epidural and intrathecal treatment of chronic pain were asked.	0.6248401836346007
Results: The response rate was 23%.	0.5993080306840284
The data show that 78% of the anaesthesiologists use epidural or intrathecal analgesia in the therapy of chronic pain.	0.6448398032484721
Local anaesthetics are used by 85% of these anaesthesiologists, followed by morphine (72%), clonidine (48%), buprenorphine (34%), baclofen (20%), fentanyl (13%) and sufentanil (10%).	0.7397450900251256
For most of the treatments local anaesthetics are used, again followed by opioids und clonidine.	0.5683809617164886
In the 137 answering pain clinics 79.821 epidural and intrathecal analgetic treatments are performed per year.	0.3509295906602848
Discussion: Epidural and intrathecal pain therapy is frequently used in Germany and Austria, either as a complementary or alternative treatment to systemic pain therapy.	0.6359192114687114
Local anaesthetics followed by opioids are the most commonly used medicaments for this treatment.	0.5617057075098228
For some of the applied substances neurotoxicological data are lacking.	0.54070540427627
The use of these substances has to be considered very carefully.	0.8355837388306696
Intraartial conduction disturbances (IACD) are the known substrate of re-entrant atrial arrhythmias and their diagnosis is important for the selection of proper therapy.	0.6384277391081107
Signs of IACD can be missed on the standard ECG, and signal averaged (SA) P wave analysis has proved valuable for the evaluation of electrophysiological (EPS) properties of atrial myocardium.	0.501329966230288
Unfavourable EPS effects of RAA pacing are known to electrophysiologists, but this aspect is rarely considered in normal practice, and RAA based pacing modes remain standard even for pts.	0.6073626235026705
We examined and compared EPS effects of different atrial pacing modes using two diagnostic tools: IEGM obtained from two atrial leads of biatrial pacing system (via telemetry) and time domain analysis of SA P wave in 22 pts.	0.5317470707658701
with BiA pacing system (implanted due to atrial arrhythmias and IACD).	0.38667629846890256
The results showed that different atrial pacing modes influence atrial activation timing parameters differently: RAA pacing aggravates IACD in comparison to sinus rhythm; the effects of CS pacing is less visible.	0.5163069345747019
BiA pacing normalises all atrial activation times.	0.20665301225384164
The normalisation of SA P wave duration, reduction of SA P wave dispersion, increasing of RMS 20 and decreasing of LAS 5 and finally abolition of presence of late atrial potentials in most of pts.	0.4667925309537145
indicates beneficial effects of BiA pacing (in pts.	0.5527925989580914
with IACD) in comparison to sinus rhythm and RAA pacing.	0.7128793997973136
Unfavourable EPS effects of RAA pacing in patients with IACD indicates suitability the need for alternative (resynchronising) atrial pacing modes.	0.4465565663851455
Time domain analysis of SA P wave is a valuable and sensitive diagnostic tool for non-invasive evaluation of EPS effects of different modes of atrial pacing.	0.5793082343980132
Background: We report a case of irreversible unilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy in connection with nasal septum surgery in intubation anaesthesia.	0.6177161074603305
On account of the spatial distance, there is no danger of injuring the hypoglossal nerve during nasal surgery.	0.5134396505367371
However, in the otorhinolaryngological and anaesthesiological literature, some cases of hypoglossal palsy following endotracheal intubation, use of the laryngeal mask airway, bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy are reported.	0.6398244488252842
The endoscopic guided puncture tracheostomy has established itself in many intensive care units.	0.3786481546367069

Chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis may occur in children, adolescents and adults, but has not been found in newborns or babies either in our series or in the literature.	0.7177099175075365
Symptoms suggesting an acute disease like fever are uncommon, but a primary chronic course with symptomatic and asymptomatic periods is typical.	0.5083004670708738
Pain and swelling are the main symptoms; painless masses are rare.	0.5848373906090291
In children and adolescents the clavicle and metaphyseal regions of long bones are typical sites of chronic abacterial osteomyelitis.	0.5978558559733929
In adults the clavicles or the first two ribs are mainly affected with synovitis of the adjacent joints, but the long bones are rarely involved.	0.7094858635163612
Laboratory findings are non-specific but important for the differential diagnosis.	0.6671384808238308
The sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein might be elevated.	0.3758937462823581
The X-ray examination shows osteolytic, sclerotic or mixed bony changes and, in case of a diaphyseal involvement, onionskinlike periosteal bone formation may be present, suggesting a malignant process.	0.5985289865097945
In late stages sclerotic bone formations may be seen as a rest.	0.5392922047242913
Uni- or multifocal lesions can be detected by bonescan, as can asymptomatic lesions.	0.8054964801448637
Magnetic resonance imaging shows gross signal intensity differences both in the bone and perifocal soft tissue and involvement of the synovium with gadolinium DPTA enhancement in T1-weighted images.	0.5705099670661776
In early stages of the disease granulocytes, microabscesses and new bone formations might suggest bacterial osteomyelitis that cannot be differentiated by histology.	0.6047023196951855
In intermediate phases lymphocytic and plasmacellular infiltrates are found, whereas in late phases sclerotic bone formations and fibrosis of the bone marrow are seen histologically.	0.5983872620803669
In chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis, all clinical, radiological and histological findings, as well as negative bacteriological cultures, are mandatory and will allow a definitive diagnosis to be made.	0.6207932086959862
The disease may be uni- or multifocal, and new bone lesions may occur over time, as well as skin manifestations, which can be found years before or after bone involvement.	0.7622012886102967
The association with dermatological diseases and/or synovitis led to the acronym SAPHO syndrome (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteomyelitis).	0.5181338935779545
For the treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective for pain relief, reduction of swelling and dysfunction.	0.7144825231953729
Antibiotics have been used in several series and are not effective.	0.7084097135265427
Major surgery is not recommended even for recurrences, and the prognosis for growth and function is excellent in the long term despite recurrences over several years.	0.796218407977015
A woman with severe stiff-man syndrome showed periodic cardiovascular dysregulation.	0.36936452185443674
The blood pressure changed spontaneously every 5-10 min.	0.6058512914259293
This rhythm was also maintained after relaxation.	0.26039442684189523

The frequency and prognostic relevance of sarcoid-likelesions and microcarcinosis in regional lymph nodes in gastric cancer (n = 113; pT1-3, pN0-1, pM0, R0) were investigated; the prognostic value was compared with pT and pN stage, grading and Laurén's tumor classification with Cox's multivariate regression-model.	0.5783937849534221
Sarcoid like lesions were found in 34 % of the cases (n = 113).	0.7043507806781871
Statistical analysis did not indicate that they had any prognostic value or showed whether or not microcarcinosis or metastasis was present; they were independent of pT stage, histological tumor type, tumor grading, and the clinical course of disease.	0.7229640213113492
Microcarcinosis (defined as scattered carcinoma cells within lymph node sinuses or pulp without adjacent stromal reaction) was revealed by immunohistochemistry in 90 % of pN0 cases; the presence of 3 or more tumor cells per lymph node section in over 10 % of sampled lymph nodes per case carried a significant prognostic value.	0.5985765810770806
In microcarcinosis without evidence of metastasis, the number of tumor cells and the number of involved lymph nodes are of prognostic value.	0.6276171907652757
In pN1 cases microcarcinosis was found as well as the metastases in 97 % and had no additional prognostic value.	0.7864064246199473
Microcarcinosis alone has a different significance from lymph node metastasis for prognosis.	0.38105033924044324
This article summarizes the most important results of the Turku Conference on active strategies for an aging workforce, which took place in Turku/Finland in 1999.	0.5756057588617646
About 140 experts from all EU-member states participated.	0.23844576951182092
The article can be seen as a contribution to the current change in the debate on labor market policy concerning older workers in Germany.	0.6096582751299642
The incidence of coronary artery aneurysm varies in the range from 0.2% to 4.9%.	0.9543739379611381
Ninety per cent of these were associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, where vessel ectasia and poststenotic dilatations are not an infrequent finding.	0.5563500631311581
We present the case of a 67 year old patient with coronary artery aneurysm and coexisting coronary artery disease of the right coronary artery.	0.8090453935861045
The patient was symptomatic and had a posterolateral myocardial infarction.	0.6204751698950143
We performed a PTCA and stent-implantation of the stenosis and coronary artery aneurysm of the right coronary artery.	0.7207232660314874
After the procedure, the patient could be discharged without angina pectoris.	0.8278947879817652
A control-angiography will be performed six months later.	0.39814297441586305
TMLR (Transmyocardial laser revascularization) is a disputed cardiosurgical technique available in Europe since 1994 that aims to deliver additional blood flow to ischemic myocardium from the left heart chamber.	0.4991988814558276
Goal of our study is morphological examination of laser channels in human hearts to answer the questions: Are there patent laser channels with communication to the left chamber and to intramural vessels?	0.5851482010968718
We examined hearts of 10 patients who died during the first 18 days after TMLR.	0.6891998841603807
Channels were examined in histological serial sections under the light microscope.	0.4655070243588504
Laser channels in the first days postoperatively have a lumen diameter of about 1 mm and are surrounded by coagulation necrosis about 500 µm thick.	0.535020427495825
Despite phagocytic removal of necrotic tissue the lumen diameter decreases during the following two weeks.	0.42512576265135144
Open intramyocardial channels can be shown in all patients.	0.4501649904957823
These channels communicate with intramural vessels, but in no instance with chamber lumen.	0.5710676554256899
Our results suggest that clinical benefits are based on improved distribution of coronary blood.	0.45873945633174695
Additional blood is not delivered from left chamber lumen to the myocardium.	0.3754799085410137
However, our patients represent the small subgroup of the deceased.	0.6620754185622505
If similar observations can be made in the majority of patients living symptomfree after TMLR remains open.	0.6040169029265596
Recurrent miscarriages are, like sporadically occurring miscarriage, often (approx.	0.5210810987986843
50 %) due to chromosomal aberrations.	0.4447284160498017
An undefined proportion of the other half may be due to immunological incompliances.	0.4645669720350701
The basis for this assumption is the fact that the maternal immune system recognizes paternal antigens and rejects them.	0.5439911663419579
The initial hypothesis that such immune reaction is due to a high similarity between the maternal and paternal HLA systems (HLA sharing) is most likely incorrect.	0.6669861647033575
Nevertheless, the incomplete recognition of the fetus by the maternal immune system and the resulting insufficient protection is basis for the active immune therapy with partner or donor lymphocytes.	0.6715887413236055
Several placebo-controlled studies have been performed.	0.7123168757347644
Due to the small number of cases, results were not significant.	0.7952454159931
A metaanalysis of all studies, however, proves significant effects of the active immune therapy.	0.4739506515955584
The risks of active immune therapy led to the development of passive immune therapy with immune globulins (IVIG).	0.49558975893431806
This therapy, however, is relatively expensive and obviously no more successful than the active immune therapy.	0.48072293461792254
In a metaanalysis of all published results, IVIG was not significantly more effective than treatment with placebo.	0.5690125606751953
The indication for both forms of immune therapy is given after 3 or more consecutive abortions, after exclusion of other reasons for these abortions.	0.6286927960471304
It appears that only primary aborting patients are suitable for active immune therapy.	0.40459485841362886
Athough the concept of immune therapy is still under debate, alternative concepts are not available.	0.6144626331685878
Hence, new therapeutic approaches are also not available.	0.7130970606715709
The first electronic implantable hearing aids for patients with hearing loss are coupled to the ossicular chain or perilymph during implantation and are now available.	0.5438812854808753
Our new Tübingen implant designed for sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the combination of an implantable microphone and piezotransducer.	0.5983478473990244
To avoid hearing losses during implantation, the Tübingen piezotransducer will be (1) fixed to the mastoid cavity and (2) positioned to one of the ossicular target points.	0.6461674589610326
This can be done with a micromanipulator which will be implanted together with transducer and microphone in the mastoid cavity.	0.5636699390061712
The manipulator weights 0.7 g. With four degrees of freedom, it allows highly secure and safe positioning of the transducer's probe tip to the ossicular chain under close to stereotactic conditions.	0.6610478401408513
The main advantages of the present micromanipulator are (1) easy handling during surgery, (2) the transducer's precise positioning to the ossicular target point with sufficient degrees of freedom, and (3) the transducer's stable fixation in the mastoid cavity in the final position.	0.7756520381859463
Following integrated safety as the leading principle, ossicular or inner ear injuries caused, e.g., by the patient's head movement or unintentional manual contact by the surgeon, are minimized.	0.6379463263162377
The micromanipulator is, as it were, the surgeon's vibration-free "artificial hand".	0.7338787384787347
The manipulator's development and its optimization to the mastoid cavity by test implantation in 50 human temporal bones are shown in detail.	0.43688537866574745
While coupling the transducer to the body of the incus, transducer, microphone, and micromanipulator can be implanted into 76% of all mastoid cavities without protrusion.	0.6222809093707831
In the case of transducers coupling to the long process of the incus, the protrusion-free implantation rate of the above-mentioned three implant modules is 78%.	0.5782862403558743
The role of neuroimaging in the acute setting of head trauma is to diagnose the extent of intracranial injury and to identify all lesions which require urgent neurosurgical treatment.	0.5584516331929447
Computed tomography (CT) remains the most important diagnostic tool for initial screening of trauma victims.	0.7036467763658617
Although magnetic resonance imaging (MR) has higher sensitivity to most traumatic lesions than CT, due to the ease and speed of CT, and the fact that sufficient monitoring of critically ill patients during the examination is much easier with CT than with MR, mean that MR is not the imaging modality of choice for the initial diagnostic work-up.	0.6924979473804531
Recent MR techniques such as FLAIR or diffusion imaging further improve the sensitivity of MR in head trauma.	0.4249847593235017
Conventional angiography is currently indicated only for few suspected vascular lesions (e.g.	0.2974515385890077
traumatic arterio-venous fistulas, vascular dissections).	0.44610501274420233
Injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament are among the major injuries to the knee joint.	0.6091978208277508
Today we are often confronted with an inapproprate and delayed diagnosis of this injury and its concomitant lesions.	0.4735380243994225
Additionally, the outcome of operative treatment has not yet reached an acceptable rate of satisfactory results.	0.7154050336991885
Therefore, the goal of this current concept review is to give a comprehensive insight into anatomy and biomechanics, injury mechanisms and pathobiomechanics, based on our experiences and data from the international literature.	0.6600715410209248
A further goal is to clarify diagnostic problems with respect to clinical examination and imaging techniques.	0.5575730258192158
We also present a differential concept for the perioperative and conservative management of posterior cruciate ligament deficient knees in order to also adequately address concomitant injuries such as posterolateral rotatory instability and combined anterior cruciate ligament injuries with the aim of further improving results.	0.49144833359899565
Sevoflurane, like all currently used volatile anaesthetics, is degraded by carbon dioxide absorbents.	0.5439194449499953
The most significant degradant is a haloalkene known trivially as "compound A".	0.5115418524577592
Compound A is nephrotoxic in rats and, at higher doses, in nonhuman primates, causing proximal tubular necrosis.	0.6467619598456323
There has been much interest in the potential for compound A toxicity in humans.	0.6258321136887196
Inhaled compound A concentrations are greatest at low flow rates, high sevoflurane concentrations, warmer absorbent, barium hydroxide vs soda lime, and drier absorbent.	0.5370851995612371
Typical inspired compound A concentrations during low-flow and closed-circuit sevoflurane anaesthesia in humans are 8-24 and 20-32 ppm with soda lime and barium hydroxide lime, respectively.	0.5140430625271502
Renal effects of compound A production during sevoflurane anesthesia have been examined in surgical patients and volunteers, using standard (creatinine clearance, serum BUN and creatinine) and experimental (urine excretion of protein, glucose, NAG, GST, AAP) markers of renal function.	0.5469913129256555
Investigations to date in surgical patients show similar renal effects of low-flow sevoflurane, low-flow isoflurane or high-flow sevoflurane.	0.8252196054021373
There have been no case reports of compound A-associated renal injury in humans.	0.5975522032729961
In volunteers, one study found changes in experimental but not conventional renal markers, while other investigations show no significant changes in either standard or experimental markers.	0.5822233737774194
The mechanism of compound A nephrotoxicity in rats appears to involve metabolism to glutathione and cysteine conjugates, and their subsequent renal uptake and metabolism by pathways that are different in rats and humans.	0.5345256462534271
In the report of the 1995 World Health Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the Definition and Classification of Cardiomyopathies, the definition of heart muscle diseases was updated.	0.4838954883496276
Idiopathic, autoimmune, and infectious forms of inflammatory cardiomyopathy are now recognized in this definition.	0.5039886970405378
Enteroviruses, adenoviruses and cytomegaloviruses are considered as main etiopathological factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory heart disease.	0.4187976555756469
We report our experience in managing a temporal bone fracture after head trauma that had no apparent clinical signs.	0.5208605890299343
Recurrent CSF rhinorrhea and meningitis lead to extensive diagnostic procedures.	0.2515584544199711
Operative exploration of the temporal bone demonstrated a fracture line along the horizontal part of the carotid artery.	0.5615678846205886
The location of the fracture did not cause such typical symptoms as hearing impairment, facial paralysis, vertigo or tinnitus.	0.573483394930104
Only CSF liquorrhea through the Eustachian tube indicated a fracture at the lateral skull base.	0.415653415427502
Hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans (Flegel's disease) is a rare but clinically and histologically highly characteristic genodermatosis.	0.6852907891123237
We report on new immunohistochemical and ultrastructural findings suggesting a complex disorder of epidermal differentiation.	0.5717282199717078
In this context, a good response to calcipotriol, a synthetic vitamin D3 derivative is of particular interest.	0.7056019972872088
Pulmonary embolism is a frequent and potentially life-threatening event with uncharacteristic clinical manifestations.	0.6272084023044534
Diagnosis is commonly established by ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy and pulmonary angiography.	0.35233169308203205
Both methods, however, carry substantial drawbacks.	0.35402657601831106
Therefore, clinicians claim that there is a need for an accurate and non-invasive diagnostic modality.	0.6735025915037116
Spiral CT of the pulmonary arteries is a recent modality, that allows reliable visualization of emboli in pulmonary arteries up to fourth-order branches.	0.6145463140798654
This paper reviews the technical aspects, typical findings and diagnostic pitfalls of this recent technique.	0.5109895281246231
The potential role of spiral CT in the screening of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism is discussed and selected cases are presented.	0.8040095649145114
Introduction: Interleukin-12-p70 (IL-12-p70) is a potent immunoregulatory cytokine composed of a heavy chain (p40) and a light chain (p35).	0.6890447636583663
Contradicting results have been reported with regard to leukocyte release and systemic concentration of IL-12 after polytrauma.	0.6560044487707105
Methods: We daily analyzed systemic concentrations of IL-12 in polytrauma patients (n = 37, mean ISS 33.9) in comparison to healthy donor values during intensive care course by ELISA.	0.6740130832736013
Patients were divided according to their mean IL-12 levels into those with elevated IL-12 (group 1, n = 7), those with decreased IL-12 (group 2, n = 4) and those with IL-12 in the normal range (group 3, n = 26).	0.8861199190054515
Results: Patients in group 1 revealed elevated levels of IL-12 up to p70 > 1000 pg/ml and p40 > 2500 pg/ml.	0.7444897315300291
The common clinical feature of group 1 was a thorax trauma in combination with pneumonia (85 % survivors).	0.6179303582066532
Patients with single thorax trauma or pneumonia without thorax trauma (group 3) showed normal IL-12 values.	0.7498185598839592
Patients with decreased IL-12 levels revealed also a thorax trauma and pneumonia but all patients succumbed.	0.46444959590731255
The groups significantly differ in their stay in the intensive care unit, in TISS, in MODS score and in respiratory ratio, but not in ISS, mean CRP values and leukocyte counts.	0.785952907749216
Correlation analysis revealed no significant relation between systemically altered IL-12 values and clinical parameters, with the exception of a negative correlation of p70 and ISS (r = -0.785) or MODS score (r = -0.314) in group 1.	0.6591615793020262
Conclusions: After major injuries there is no overall suppression of IL-12 formation.	0.6407948002410597
Patients with normal or elevated IL-12 levels belong mainly to the survivors, whereas patients with decreased IL-12 levels are at high risk of succumbing to multi-organ failure.	0.6722423177293413
This article reviews the pathogenesis and clinical and imaging findings in shoulder impingement syndrome.	0.5760375070799308
Shoulder impingement is caused by compression of the supraspinatus tendon underneath the coracoacromial arch, mainly in forward flexion of the arm.	0.5078479525536841
Different stages of impingement syndrome are described.	0.3695301910016478
Stage I relates to edema and hemorrhage of the supraspinatus tendon.	0.3255677070223421
Stage II is characterized by bursal inflammation and fibrosis, as well as tendinopathy.	0.465818960186898
In stage III there is a tear of the rotator cuff.	0.5629578480767495
Moreover, calcifying tendinitis, fractures and pain originating from the cervical spine may mimic shoulder impingement syndrome.	0.5026240834301783
Imaging is important for the exact diagnosis.	0.6394077417310134
Standard radiographs are the basis of imaging in shoulder impingement syndrome.	0.36175281376204566
They may demonstrate subchondral sclerosis of the major tuberosity, subacromial spurs, and form anomalies of the acromion.	0.5376187250541645
They are also important in the differential diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome and demonstrate calcifying tendinitis, fractures and neoplasm.	0.6000861694202725
Ultrasonography has found acceptance as a screening tool and even as a final diagnostic method by many authors.	0.5515560404363521
However, there is a high interobserver variability in the demonstration of rotator cuff tears.	0.7627518193979844
Its usefulness has therefore been questioned.	0.3302737393149788
MR imaging is probably the method of choice in the evaluation of the rotator cuff and surrounding structures.	0.7138846064572055
Several investigations have demonstrated that differentiation of early findings, such as tendinopathy versus partial tears, may be difficult with MR imaging.	0.5906753764781032
However, reproducibility for full-thickness tears appears to be higher than for sonography.	0.489868963469387
Moreover, specificity appears to be superior to sonography.	0.5429540734114348
MR arthrography is not universally accepted.	0.3568375779904951
However, it allows for more exact differentiation of discrete findings and may be indicated in preoperative planning.	0.7775007317558783
Standard arthrography and CT have a limited role in the current assessment of the rotator cuff.	0.6172998150466402
Gastric carcinoma of the infiltrative type (according to Ming) occasionally shows adenomatous differentiation only.	0.3558767440127686
Over the past 18 years, we have observed 23 cases of this tumour type, accounting for 3.6 % of all surgically treated gastric carcinomas.	0.8582364893783204
Macroscopically they were classified as Borrmann IV or III, while histologically most of them were well differentiated.	0.6194987214959868
Histologically, these tumours retained the pre-existing structures of the stomach, most readily observable at the tunica muscularis propria; a pronounced desmoplasia was also characteristic, particularly in the submucosal and subserosal layers.	0.6419699134744283
In all cases the tumour tissue spread inside lymphatic vessels.	0.5750065491340011
All but 2 cases with metastatically involved lymph nodes, often small, showed infiltration of the lymph node sinus; in three quarters of cases the serosa was infiltrated by the tumour.	0.6943996292349882
Significant findings among the patients under observation for extended periods included bilateral ovarian metastases in 4 of 5 women examined and tumour recurrence at the anastomosis in 6 of 9 patients in whom Billroth II operation had been performed.	0.521105382210222
The mean survival time of 16 patients was 14.9 months.	0.6224377322253505
Owing to the diffuse type of tumour growth, extensive surgery is recommended as in cases of signet ring cell cancer.	0.6291255302314709
The high incidence of small lymph node metastases from this type of tumour should also be taken in account at preoperative staging.	0.5706184906436266
Preoperative diagnosis of this tumour subtype is difficult, because histological criteria alone do not allow clear identification.	0.6449164723126204
Close cooperation with clinical investigators is necessary, and intraoperative assessment of the tumour - including frozen section of necessary - in particular is of the outmost importance.	0.8746724850787851
One rare case of so-called massive idiopathic osteolysis Gorham-Stout is presented.	0.29468999452459904
In a 77-year-old female patient the whole right femoral head and neck of femur was resorbed within 2.5 month following trauma.	0.6283893156520789
As a histologic cause for the osteolysis, a marked stimulation of osteoclasts on the spongiosa, especially intracortically, was observed.	0.6720760364036498
The course and the clinical findings are described, and the pathogenesis and treatment are discussed in comparison with the present literature.	1.0952949727305248
The results suggest that an early antiresorptive therapy (calcitonin, bisphosphonates) could stop the progressive osteolytic changes.	0.5163647212286182
In this paper the relationship between psychodiagnosis and client-centered therapy is discussed.	0.663211206868983
Rogers is wrongly said to have rejected any kind of diagnosis and that this therapy form has therefore developed an ambiguous relationship to this issue.	0.49114868202405726
If one sees psychodiagnosis as something psychodynamic, and symptoms as defense strategies against underlying conflicts, then a comprehensive 'status diagnosis' using more or less traditional psychiatric categories appears compatible with theory-led client-centered diagnosis in the initial phase and during the course of therapy.	0.4933796223661871
Client-centered psychotherapy itself may be seen as a continuous process of dialogue in which 'assumed diagnoses' (embedded in the therapist's 'empathic knowledge') are jointly checked and in which the client through direct experience learns to understand and change his 'diagnosis'.	0.5441899565046191
In the examination of reversible segmental (articular) hypomobile dysfunction (blockage) of the spine, we have to recognize by palpation the feeling of beginning resistance at the end of the passive movement ("barrier").	0.6454374611698057
This is the main finding to diagnose segmental (articular) dysfunction.	0.5321502738431221
Normal mobility gives us a slowly increasing resistance with possible springing at the end.	0.4528830388552382
In contrary, the sudden feeling of hard tension without springing is seen as typical for the restricted movement in articular dysfunction, i. e. restriction of joint facet gliding.	0.5173575846276379
Multiple intra- and paraglandular lymph nodes develop in the parotid gland, including salivary gland tissue with acinar and ductal formations.	0.6089719567349962
In the same way heterotopic salivary gland tissue can be localized in cervical lymph nodes.	0.6604654878782501
Except for the frequently occurring Warthin tumours, primary salivary gland tumours, which develop in the lymph nodes of the parotid gland or the cervical lymph nodes, are rare.	0.7427439627230742
Examples of these are adenomas (pleomorphic adenoma, basal cell adenoma) and carcinomas (acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma).	0.5028900575503943
Three of our own observations (sebaceous lymphadenoma, acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma) are analysed.	0.5145216196592967
The condition for the diagnosis of primary salivary gland tumour within a lymph node is reliable evidence that the salivary gland tissue is tumour-free and that no other occult carcinoma is present.	0.6097305582878427
We report on a three month old infant presenting with vaginal bleeding.	0.5377998630365594
Precocious pseudopuberty due to an autonomous ovarian cyst was diagnosed.	0.3585603531096582
Within three months the follicular cyst spontaneously regressed.	0.3730949944251849
Elevated estradiol levels also decreased spontaneously.	0.15589503829581622
The purpose of this study was to determine whether 24 hour patch testing with 0.5% sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) could reliably predict skin susceptibility to an irritant when compared with the alkali resistance test (ART), a widely used method employing sodium hydroxide.	0.6496275360852277
After having given informed consent, 40 patients (age range from 20 to 60 years) with an active irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), 40 patients in whom ICD had cleared, as well as 40 healthy volunteers serving as controls were tested.	0.6805032541526842
The skin responses to SLS were assessed both visually and by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) as an indicator of stratum corneum integrity.	0.5365510372888138
SLS significantly increased the erythema scores and TEWL in patients with healed ICD, and the increase of TEWL was even more pronounced in patients with active ICD.	0.6997252558948929
By contrast, a decrease in alkali resistance was found in patients with active ICD only but not in patients with healed ICD.	0.7148811607306053
The data obtained indicate that the SLS test, unlike ART, may provide a non-invasive tool predicting a possible constitutional skin susceptibility or indicating a subclinically impaired epidermal barrier function.	0.583818010202095
However, because of the relatively high interindividual variation, a cut-clear statement concerning the skin susceptibility cannot be made by this test.	0.7043530578987541
On the other hand, the ART seems only to be useful for following and documenting the healing period following ICD.	0.5259343627689388
Introduction: The correction of low to moderate astigmatism is possible today by means of photoablation (PRK), while the treatment of moderate and higher astigmatism still involves refractive keratotomy.	0.6256273054832682
Experience has shown that cataract surgery, using modern tunnel techniques with self-healing incisions, results in earlier stability in both the refractive outcome and wound healing.	0.6378283933292992
In this study, we attempted to combine the advantages of lamellar keratotomy with those of a pair-wise T-incision as arcuate lamellar keratotomy (ALK).	0.570242849694363
An often unrecognized but potentially fatal complication, mostly seen in posttraumatic patients under intensive care, is reactive acute cholecystitis.	0.528744484621107
On account of the high specificity of ultrasound diagnosis in the biliary system we decided to examine the ultrasound criteria for early detection of posttraumatic cholecystitis.	0.664430206483729
Ultrasound of the abdomen was performed prospectively, seven times on different days, in each of 40 artificially respirated patients under intensive care conditions over a period of 12 months.	0.593316200651618
The results show that artificial respiration, parenteral feeding and previous trauma can lead to tardive (28/40) wallthickening or to a three-layered wall of the gallbladder (9/40).	0.5993298977094805
In 22.5 % of patients (9/40) we found the sonographic signs of acute cholecystitis.	0.8927251969070408
In correlation with the clinical signs, cholecystectomy was indicated in only two patients.	0.687076404959338
The preoperative ultrasonographic findings and clinical signs of 23 patients with the diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis were analysed retrospectively.	0.7010476212881281
We found good correlation between sonographic and clinical signs of acute cholecystitis in 21 of these 23 patients.	0.48200069003145035
Our study shows that the morphological correlate of a thickened three-layered gallbladder wall can occur in the context of systemic alterations, even if there is no underlying cholecystitis.	0.6571834810094441
The diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis and the indication for cholecystectomy should be based on the synopsis of pathologic and clinical findings.	0.6225196542284024
Osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and a deterioration of bone structure which results in an increased fracture risk.	0.6072091773310971
The purpose of this review is to evaluate structure analysis techniques in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	0.7023571876258131
Several imaging techniques were applied to analyze trabecular bone, such as conventional radiography, high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI).	0.766599231549055
The best results were obtained using high-resolution tomographic techniques.	0.7329412895490087
The highest spatial resolutions in vivo were achieved using HR-MRI.	0.32957510477130203
These studies show that texture parameters and bone mineral density predict bone strength and osteoporotic fractures in a complementary fashion.	0.45320881873591756
Combining both techniques yields the best results in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	0.6225664071270457
Classification of cosmetics, which are more and more similar to topical therapeutic agents, is getting increasingly difficult for dermatologists.	0.7238051449931775
Their definition within the EU and the respective European directives, replacing national laws step by step, will be briefly presented.	0.3611510699759853
The problems of distinguishing cosmetics from medicinal products will be discusssed in detail by examples from clinical practice.	0.3630223739898042
Finally, we will review the various active substances which tend to be added to cosmetics following the global trend in the cosmetic industry towards developing "medicinally" active cosmetics, and in the pharmaceutical industry towards "cosmetically" oriented medicinal products as part of a current "life-style" ideology.	0.6153193282680485
In some clinical dermatological fields these active substances may allow the dermatologists to use cosmetics as topical therapeutic agents.	0.41622014814763675
The decision whether a rotator cuff tear has a traumatic or degenerative origin still causes some controversy.	0.3697702520177817
Especially in medical expert appraisements the etiology of the rotator cuff tear plays an important role refering to insurance services for the patient.	0.5458832421928662
The purpose of this paper is to compare the intraoperative pathomorphologic shape of the cuff tear in traumatic and degenerative cases.	0.6435583511264658
This study reports of 56 patients with rotator cuff tears which were devided in primarily acute, subacute traumatic and degenerative study groups refering to their history of present illness.	0.49350397151226155
We considered the location of the tear, the shape and the size.	0.6751351784115163
Furthermore the grade of retraction of the supraspinatus tendon, its quality and the shape of the long head of biceps were examined.	0.5857668083711397
The results showed that in general the shape of the tear gives only in some cases significant information whether the etiology is traumatic or not.	0.7012022188375411
The isolated rupture of the subscapularis muscle and the hematoma at the edge of the tendon is siginificant for the trauma.	0.5067798099897814
In comparison with the degenerative study group the tenosynovitis and the dislocation of the long head of biceps is in our study sigificant for traumatic tears.	0.6566738871960692
Health care decision making in incompetent severely ill patients presents many difficult medical, ethical, and legal problems for the physician.	0.5446029077096682
At the same time nurses represent the group of medical professionals who have the closest contact with the patient and who have to carry out most of the decisions and instructions.	0.7401984832678098
Barber's disease is produced by short hairs that penetrate the interdigital spaces of the hands.	0.4798557465466267
The following chronic inflammatory reaction causes fistulas or sinuses and cysts.	0.3907532776274285
We present the case of a patient with interdigital pilonidal sinuses of all web spaces in both hands.	0.5132054108737382
Such an extensive case of this occupational disease has so far not been reported.	0.5190084004473371
The treatment of critically ill patients compromises frequently between an adequate fluid resuscitation for maintenance of a sufficient regional perfusion on the one hand and the avoidance of pulmonary edema on the other hand.	0.5705573662280018
The application of the transpulmonary indicator dilution method allows the orientation of fluid therapy by using the parameters 'intrathoracic blood volume' and 'extravascular lung water'.	0.4995835097844603
This technique is less invasive than the pulmonary artery catheter since it only needs a 3 or 4 French catheter in the femoral artery.	0.6168887403454039
Additionally, controlling the fluid therapy with the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is severely limited in the mechanically ventilated patient.	0.44574474695133365
Therefore, the intrathoracic blood volume may be of advantage in the critically care patient in comparison to the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to assess the cardiac preload.	0.6908669002548786
Furthermore, the indocyanine clearance adds a valuable parameter to assess liver function when the double indicator technique is used.	0.47351062204126415
Hypnosis, autogenic training, progressive relaxation and biofeedback show good empirical evidence concerning relaxation-therapy and are useful techniques in psycho- or behavior-therapy.	0.5513837808005693
Though they share some aspects with body-oriented psychotherapy these relaxation-techniques show a modern scientific orientation and are therefore to seperate from religious meditation.	0.4305049955558441
Though in details somewhat different, the methodology of these techniques creates a framework, in which the psychophysiological determined relaxation response is easily elicited.	0.6899466466825771
However, regular practice of the patients is requiered.	0.8633267325438659
Focussed attention, imagination and new attributions of bodily or mental perceptions play a dominant role concerning the therapeutic effects, which may contribute to enhanced internal selfcontrol and selfesteem.	0.5643320711591168
Controlled clinical studies give evidence to positive effects concerning various psychosomatic disorders (e.g.	0.3315157391718876
headache, pain, ess.	0.5759998462460102
hypertension), as well as anxiety and sleeping disorders.	0.4111319283387542
As components of psychotherapeutic or behavioral programs, there is even more evidence for effects of relaxation in a broad spectrum of disorders (e.g.	0.4834589304612688
Relaxation therapy is a well established and scientific-based component in the treatment of psychic, psychosomatic or psychiatric disorders, except psychosis.	0.6602972078870034
Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disease first described in 1873 by Murray.	0.5647245117192738
Major diagnostic criteria are multiple cutaneous tumors and gingival hypertrophy; minor criteria include contractures, osteolytic lesions and a positive family history.	0.4758152513590911
A 35-year-old woman suffering from Crohn's disease for 3 years developed painful erythematous nodular lesions predominantly on the dorsa of her hands and feet, as well as on her elbows and wrists.	0.5272660205163091
The clinical features and histopathological picture of leukocytoclastic vasculitis were both highly suggestive of erythema elevatum diutinum.	0.46721940379232585
No improvement of the skin lesions was observed during treatment with high doses of oral steroids.	0.936934632880813
In contrast, treatment with dapsone resulted in a marked reduction of skin lesions.	0.6404636182929133
During a new attack of her Crohn's disease the erythema elevatum diutinum lesions flared again.	0.4077694009805505
The parallel clinical course of erythema elevatum diutinum and Crohn's disease, as well as the detection of immune complexes and neutrophilic granulocytes in lesions of both diseases, strongly suggest a common etiology.	0.5403356515764178
This hypothesis is discussed in context with this case and the recent literature.	0.7199728020165955
The mammalian brain is capable of a substantial functional reorganization, manifesting on a cortical somatotopical and on a behavioral level.	0.38353093974351454
Possible mechanisms are reviewed based on the work by others and ourselves on somatosensory reorganization in humans.	0.4554049945605928
The somatosensory system is characterized by divergent projections from the periphery to the cerebral cortex.	0.44751302225100825
Changes in synaptic weights allow for reorganization of sensory processing: On one side, limb amputation will result in a representational "invasion" of the deafferentated cortex from neighboring regions with concomitant perceptual changes.	0.4687203416142423
On the other side, sensorimotor training can increase the representational cortical zone of a limb.	0.5978415813968218
Plastic changes can be temporary or persistent.	0.24113577811191686
Modulating factors like pain and certain drugs seem to induce a permissive state in the cortex resulting in enhanced reorganization.	0.4289173399665272
Thus, specific physical training combined with pharmacoceutical modulation holds promise to improve functional recovery after brain lesions.	0.49337390160067296
There have been some prospective randomized studies which compared primary angioplasty with intravenous thrombolysis in patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).	0.5502712078428247
However, a substantial number of patients with AMI who would not have been included in those trials are treated with one of these two therapeutic options.	0.786091562590714
To describe the proportions, characteristics, and outcome of these patients treated with primary angioplasty or thrombolysis we analyzed the data of the prospective "Maximal Individual Optimized Therapy for Acute Myocardial Infarction" (MITRA) trial.	0.7402152601289822
Chronic infectious diseases may run over many months and years, accompanied by only mild clinical signs and often without organ-specific symptoms.	0.44194350265365256
People with any kind of immuno deficiency are more frequently affected by chronic infections.	0.3858307526501864
History, physical examination, laboratory tests, microbiological tests and imaging methods may lead to an exact diagnosis.	0.6842113907669589
The most important differential diagnosis are autoimmune diseases, amyloidosis and malignant lymphoma.	0.5469954603063313
Background: We perform partial sphincterectomy during cataract surgery in cases with very small pupil (< 3 mm).	0.7240243532835456
We assume that the small pupil is mainly due to a fibrosis ring of the sphincter muscle.	0.5011102275461821
Trauma scores in emergency medicine quantitatively characterise the severity of trauma victims' injuries and physiologic derangements.	0.492203622228245
They are used to detect and assess patients and have applications in guiding patient care and early therapeutic decisions.	0.5522206259398974
In the pre-clinical setting, an effective trauma index meets the following criteria: - It is highly reliable with regard to identifying high- and low-risk patients.	0.7612084364854773
- It has high face-validity.	0.678791656004811
- It has high inter- and intra-rater reliability.	0.7452311531645369
- It is easy to use and allows rapid, accurate measurements.	0.7100314762697019
The most widely accepted injury severity index is probably the Injury Severity Score (ISS).	0.6016360011087596
It is calculated as the sum of the squares of the three most severely injured body regions, and was originally developed as a means to standardise the description of injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents.	0.6146269654939829
The Trauma Score (TS) represents the gold standard of physiologic scoring of injury severity.	0.49388365873994183
It summarises the numerical assessments of the central nervous and cardiopulmonary system functions.	0.45346714309106456
The recently developed Mainz Emergency Evaluation Score (MEES) is based upon numerical specification of the vital signs, including a pain scale, and has been designed as a dynamic score.	0.765939195346833
Nevertheless, limitations of the established trauma score systems have been described.	0.5907026888034174
Mortality and patient outcome do not strictly correlate with injury severity scoring.	0.4059316580866542
In addition, intubated or paralysed patients were excluded from outcome studies since the scoring systems lacked options for evaluation of pathophysiological conditions after therapeutic interventions.	0.40988504059428355
Thus, therapeutic efficacy could hardly be assessed, and subsequent scoring during time periods was impossible.	0.5503224449372384
The accurate definition of comprehensive evaluation of a trauma victim is challenging, for example, "pain" as chosen in the MEES must be regarded as a highly desirable piece of information although its rating may prove difficult, especially when classifying unconscious patients.	0.6564355368225614
Further criticisms of the above-mentioned trauma indices could include omission of the trauma victim's age, gender, pre-injury health status, or the influence of alcohol or additional medication.	0.563926857791627
Moreover, questioning the interrater reliability of injury severity scoring, a recent study revealed bias in assigning values to trauma patients: trained raters classified injury severity with significantly higher indices than less experienced researchers.	0.46355696265345625
If trauma indices in pre-hospital emergency medicine were relied upon as the only means of evaluating a trauma patient and guiding therapeutic approaches, significant numbers of trauma victims requiring major interventions would be missed.	0.5134540938513111
Resuscitative treatment regimens must not be based solely upon indices, since, e.g., in states of shock injury scores do not correlate with fluid resuscitative requirements.	0.5757828368462381
Furthermore, a qualitative assignment of single vital-function parameters as crucial indices for a patient's condition never reflects the broad range of a patient's profile.	0.6983904747634591
Many multiple-trauma patients do benefit from controlled ventilation in clinical experience even though pulse oximetry values are within the physiological range, and the administration of analgesics or even pre-hospital anaesthesia has often proved advantageous for trauma patients in the field.	0.6742839163003526
Providing the opportunity of subsequent patient evaluation and the efficacy of acute care, the MEES has been developed as a dynamic scoring system.	0.6613078900278354
This design is extremely desirable and must be regarded as an indispensible criterion for future scoring systems.	0.41265044225701836
In view of the peculiarities of field emergency medicine, pre-hospital indices do have limitations.	0.44356493002754493
The parameters "unknown patient", time pressure, unprecise measurements, lack of diagnostic facilities, incomplete evaluation, and limited statistical power cannot be eliminated.	0.521375155589113
Accurate prediction of outcome within early time-frames is therefore not possible.	0.32106414651790766
Ossification of the Achilles tendon is the result of a traumatic, hypoxic injury of the tendon.	0.6863833993543325
The usually asymptomatic ossification has a clinical importance only in case of a new trauma.	0.6233753539146956
We report about a patient with an isolated fracture of the ossification without an accompanying rupture of the Achilles tendon.	0.6976303541233507
Because of the radiologically "occult" fracture the diagnosis could only be verified by MRI.	0.5310019762022782
With a conservative treatment without resection of the ossification we could reach painless recovery.	0.5371379160647896
Hair problems are attacked at the levels of information supply, trichological competence and evidence based medical treatment.	0.35607353702988037
The alopecias represent a major health care challenge, and the psychological significance of hair loss has only recently found appreciation in the medical community.	0.6517988174423918
They may pose a vexing problem for non-specialized physicians, who tend to trivialize such complaints, although the patient's perception of abnormality determines whether or not advice is sought.	0.6006549969012583
Perception of a hair problem is subject to sociocultural standards; films and advertisements help determine the threshold for "normality" and what is "healthy" and "beautiful", and the media provide an abundance of undiscriminating information with respect to hair care.	0.6082905525215405
Patients with hair problems frequently consult the hairdresser prior to the medical specialist.	0.48698400820504845
Thus additional areas of competence should be incorporated into the hairdresser's training qualifications.	0.33835919495490163
Besides manual, creative and psychological aptitudes, "trichological competence" relating to the recognition of most important hair disorders, recognition of personal limitations and cooperation with the medical specialist are required.	0.5621762616283291
To optimize the interaction between the physician, hairdressers and the media, more effective communication and public activities from the medical profession are desirable, with success depending on full identification of the set goals, qualification and adherance to the standards determined by the medical speciality.	0.6153529235416055
We reexamined biopsy and resection specimens from seven patients with histologically established primary diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) which showed previously undetected adenocarcinomatous differentiation after chemotherapy.	0.5855024483908268
Adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the same part of the lung as was SCLC before treatment in five cases and in contralateral location in two.	0.7383754969813536
Two tumors showed heterogeneous differentiation with small-cell and adenocarcinomatous components, and five had only adenocarcinoma.	0.6359386650910503
The interval between histological evidence of SCLC and adenocarcinoma was 3 months-5 years.	0.5232353364787394
From the specific findings in the respective patients we can offer two possible explanations for changing differentiation in SCLC after chemotherapy: (a) a primarily heterogeneously differentiated tumor with selection of adenocarcinomatous component under chemotherapy, and (b) an independently developed adenocarcinoma after successful chemotherapy of SCLC, as patients with treated SCLC are known to have an increased risk of non-SCLC.	0.6582652068628311
However, therapy-induced alteration of differentiation seems much more unlikely.	0.5713349084350218
These findings should be considered in diagnosis and therapy of SCLC to allow early and appropriate reaction to non-SCLC components.	0.6413245889441211
Demonstration of BDV-specific serum antibodies, the isolation of BDV from cerebrospinal fluid of neuropsychiatric patients, and the recent demonstration of BDV antigen and BDV-RNA in human brain tissue strongly suggest that BDV can infect humans.	0.6104403421427569
Isolation of BD virus from brain tissue is needed for final proof.	0.38247667581836997
There is still great controversy about the question of whether BDV antigen, BDV-RNA or BDV can be detected in peripheral blood monocytes or not.	0.6133911878092301
Overall, the question of pathogenicity of BDV infection for humans is wide open.	0.5500633033646884
Investigations of human cerebrospinal fluid indicate that BDV might cause human lymphocytic meningoencephalitis and so-called symptomatic psychoses in rare cases.	0.347104087179939
Seroepidemiological studies suggest a widely non-specific but possibly pathogenic role of BDV in a spectrum of psychiatric disorders.	0.555804251067108
In a controlled prospective study we compared the efficacy of combined salt water bath and UVA/B phototherapy to a UVA/B mono-phototherapy in patients with subacute atopic dermatitis (AD).	0.5084586249339561
The patients in the balneophototherapy group (n=16) were treated with baths containing 3-5% of the synthetic salt Psori-sal, followed immediately by UVA/B irradiation, while the other treatment arm (n=12) received UVA/B phototherapy alone.	0.7561952528715583
After 20 treatments the balneophototherapy group showed a statistically significant (p<=0.0015) reduction of the SCORAD score from 69.5 before to 36.8 after therapy.	0.6109678670737596
No statistically significant reduction in the SCORAD score could be observed in the UVA/B phototherapy group (50.6 before to 44.3 after therapy).	0.7460256789777463
The cumulative UVB dose was significantly lower in the balneophototherapy group (0.9 J/cm2) as compared to the UVA/B monotherapy group (2.0 J/cm2).	0.7287495917768323
Balneophototherapy was well tolerated by patients with atopic dermatitis and no side effects were observed.	0.5865895425131221
We conclude that balneophototherapy expands the therapeutic options for patients with subacute atopic dermatitis.	0.514118308327215
Five percent of all human tumors are found in the head and neck region with an increasing rate.	0.6361437929670732
Head and neck tumors are not only a significant problem because of the large number of people affected.	0.8675258438313197
The functional and cosmetic disadvantages and stigmas related to the therapy influence the medical recommendations for each individual patient.	0.5941315272287502
Background and purpose: Only a few clinical reports about the routine use of intravenous rt-PA for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been published.	0.7168258184935226
Wether the perfusion of the extracranial parts of the internal carotid artery influences the outcome of the patients is still unknown, because the two major studies about systemic thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA in stroke (ECASS and NINDS) did not formally assess the status of the extracranial vessels.	0.7375776677131991
Introduction: Chronic pain is an individually variable experience, incorporating physical, psychological and social dimensions.	0.6220522799904986
Chronic pain occurs in a broad spectrum of severity; therefore, a grading procedure is of crucial importance in clinical research and in epidemiologic studies.	0.5981366308187246
It is mandatory to differentiate between traumatic and atraumatic instability when treating shoulder instability.	0.4710827266849471
The traumatic instability is characterized by secondary lesions (Bankart lesion, Hill-Sachs lesion, overstretching of the capsule), which are caused at the time of primary dislocation.	0.6664943858060096
The quality of the capsule has to be considered in close relationship to the appearance of the Bankart lesion.	0.862509129881532
The stronger the capsule, the greater the external force has to be in order to surmount the resistance caused by the capsule.	0.6309663591093118
The damage to the glenoid rim makes it possible to draw conclusions about the condition of the capsule.	0.6076486231836341
In cases of atraumatic instability, secondary lesions are normally absent.	0.4880501411345878
These instabilities are often caused by laxity of the capsule.	0.3288678325494346
When stabilizing, a shoulder two criteria have to be taken into consideration: stability and function.	0.5925023830693429
Reattachment of the labrum alone will not guarantee stability.	0.42450587816274943
Additionally, the overstretched capsule has to be shortened or shifted.	0.5324265172079193
Both criteria are decisive for the success of the stabilizing operation.	0.5037577966230887
In benign goiter, thyroidectomy is only indicated in patients with nodular alterations of the complete thyroid gland.	0.5230910055283717
There is no evidence indicating that total thyroidectomy could improve the postoperative results in patients with Graves' disease.	0.6481501086232003
In Germany, thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymph node dissection is the standard procedure for all differentiated thyroid carcinomas.	0.6293055734007695
However, there are no data to prove that this approach is superior to less radical procedures.	0.7976564945017058
Avoidance of reoperations and optimal conditions for effective postoperative radioiodine therapy are arguments for this aggressive strategy.	0.36595638518679463
In patients with medullary carcinoma or with detected ret-proto-oncogene mutations, thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymphadenectomy should be the initial operation.	0.5153279806197525
The cervicolateral and mediastinal compartments should be dissected when clinically obvious lymph node metastases are present in patients with differentiated carcinomas.	0.4877564510839825
In patients with medullary carcinomas, persistently increased calcitonin levels after the initial operation are sufficient indication for this procedure.	0.5808538195361913
Thyroidectomy is an important part of the multimodal approach in patients with anaplastic carcinomas.	0.6231736611148612
The operative technique of thyroidectomy is presented as well as the technique of cervical lymphadenectomy in consideration of the lymphatic drainage of the thyroid gland.	0.772478385499975
Tyrosinemia type I is an autosomal recessively inherited deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase resulting in accumulation of tyrosin and its degradation products (succinylacetoacetone mainly).	0.37900708255196075
Typical clinical features include liver and kidney failure as well as central nervous system involvement.	0.5204833968887123
There are three main forms of the disease: the acute form with manifestation in newborn infants and the subacute and the chronic form in children older than one year of age.	0.6065945579337527
Experimental data and clinical as well as postmortem experiences have indicated that subdural hematomas are less frequent in acceleration injuries in traffic accidents compared to falls or assaults.	0.4585691428461623
The present report demonstrates that this does not hold true in the same way for bridging vein ruptures (one of the predominant causes for subdural bleedings).	0.6196583260665308
Ruptures of these vessels without subdural bleeding (SDB) are only seldom mentioned in the literature.	0.5497369167328812
However, if no SDB is present, no one will look for these structures.	0.6882315142341032
In our institute a systematic analysis of the bridging veins in all cases of lethal blunt head injury is made: prior to the careful morphological preparation we investigate these vessels by radiographic imaging after filling with contrast medium.	0.5375204516821971
6 car passengers (age between 4 and 31 years) which suffered a lethal head injury were examined in the last year.	0.8140296061140083
2 victims had impressed fractures with cerebral compression injuries.	0.2703337992621864
In 1 case the base of the skull was broken and in 3 cases no skull fracture was present; no serious focal brain injury had occured in these 4 cases, but 3 victims had signs of diffuse brain injury.	0.6412142615625753
In 5 cases a direct impact of the head against the interior of the car was obvious.	0.7076203796913904
In 5 cases ruptures of serveral bridging veins could be demonstrated.	0.43713571110814536
In one case (survival for 3 days) a minor SDB (20 ml) was present and the ruptures had been closed by thrombosis; another victim died at the scene.	0.8084399043845762
The other 3 victims survived between 4 and 15 hours without developing SDB and without closing of the ruptures by thrombosis.	0.41331738969267956
This combination is surprising and shows that our knowledge concerning the relationship between bridging vein ruptures and SDB is restrictred.	0.4933176832893622
The frequency of bridging vein lesions in severe head injuries is likely underestimated in the clinical as well as in the postmortem literature.	0.6985125534197767
A rapid increase of intracranial pressure after the accident resulting in a collapse of the cerebral circulation is probably responsible for the absence of the SDB in the presented cases.	0.7303421924992703
Implantable hearing aids can form the basis of new surgical techniques for dealing with hearing problems originating in the inner ear, provided they are fully implantable.	0.50363856372665
Accordingly, a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, combined project was initiated at the ENT clinic of the University of Tübingen which was to conclude with operations to improve hearing via fully implantable hearing aids.	0.598309703301842
A novel electromechanical transducer for implantable hearing aids based on the piezoelectric principle is described.	0.4636992043220308
Unlike the piezoelectric transducers reported so far, this transducer does not rely on the bimorphic principle but on a circle-shaped, heteromorphic combination system consisting of a piezoceramic disc and metal membrane.	0.4149672613547033
The transducer can be hermetically sealed and is designed for implantation into the mastoid.	0.36648461919152464
Transfer of mechanical oscillations to an ossicle in the middle ear is effected by a directly fixed coupling rod or via suitable coupling elements.	0.43595675403595
The transducer is highly tuned with a resonance frequency at the upper end of the spectral transfer range (greater than 10 kHz).	0.5115355623362079
Below this resonance and down to low frequencies, the frequency response of elongation is smooth with amplitudes of around 20 nm.	0.4931980715842859
At low and middle frequencies of up to 1 kHz, these vibration amplitudes correspond to sound-pressure levels of around 90 dB SPL.	0.5588182576408988
At higher frequencies of up to 10 kHz, the output level increases to about 130 dB SPL.	0.6191934445869401
Nonlinear distortions are also very small at the highest levels (less than 0.1%) throughout the whole transfer range.	0.5048774025784959
Electric power consumption at maximum levels is in the range of a few microwatts and is therefore significantly lower than that of electromagnetic systems.	0.5791743694607976
Particularly, this makes it possible to use the transducer in fully implantable hearing aids for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss.	0.6248738501460873
In craniomaxillofacial traumatology, surgical oncology and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction, a surgeon's aim may interfere with the prechiasmatic visual pathway.	0.5591374135911095
Precise concepts and therapeutic strategies are mandatory to detect and deal with anterior visual pathway disorders.	0.5850153784204785
In order to develop these strategies, knowledge of the pathomechanisms of potential optic nerve trauma, primary radiological investigations, and further diagnostic measures are important.	0.720148165966678
Due to the difficulties in neuroophthalmological testing of visual pathway functioning in severely injured patients or even during craniomaxillofacial reconstructions, we established flash-evoked visual potentials (VEP) and the electroretinogram (ERG) as reliable electrophysiological methods to gather specific information as to whether the visual pathway function is intact, even if pathological, but still present or absent.	0.6593102448901947
Case reports show that subjectively or objectively confirmed unilateral amaurosis does not neccessarily mean irreversible vision loss.	0.26554283489472774
The electrophysiological evaluation together with multiplanar computer tomography (CT) are important for the immediate identification of optic nerve trauma.	0.606622280395309
The results of this evaluation will provide the diagnostic information on whether surgical intervention and/or conservative therapy is required to prevent secondary optic nerve damage.	0.6842598054966536
The conservative therapy of choice for the treatment of traumatic optic nerve lesions is the methylprednisolone-megadosis regimen (30 mg Urbason/kg bodyweight i.v.	0.6055256684591337
and 5.4 mg/kg bodyweight/h i.v.	0.7063883451148947
for the following 47 h).	0.388062027606952
Surgical therapy involves decompression of the orbital compartment in case of retrobulbar hematoma or decompression of the intracanalicular part of the optic nerve in the traumatized optic canal or posterior orbit as confirmed by CT.	0.4726244759439689
Prospective analysis of our trauma patients and the international literature on traumatic optic nerve lesions show that the time factor in when to start therapy has been greatly underestimated.	0.7274310975309791
To fulfill modern treatment concepts in craniomaxillofacial surgery, sound diagnostic and therapeutic knowledge on the maintenance of visual pathway function is required.	0.5594343408745249
In the presence of preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes, and preterm maturation of the cervix, there is an increased risk for premature birth.	0.7652086809370915
There is a combination of endocrine as well as paracrine regulations which are responsible for the events associated with preterm labor, maturation of the cervix, and preterm rupture of the membranes.	0.6408061846721572
Apart from classical hormones, various pro-inflammatory cytokines act as mediators.	0.49653354014282053
At the fetal-maternal interface - which is formed by the placenta with the chorioamnion on the fetal side and the decidua, myometrium, and the cervix on the maternal side - an intense interaction between endocrine and immunological reactions has been observed.	0.6477567900385921
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone with multiple functions in humans, produced by the pineal gland and stimulated by -adrenergic receptors.	0.6829428778656073
Serum melatonin levels exhibit a circadian rhythm with low levels during the day, rise in the evening and maximum levels at night between 2 and 4 a.m.. Melatonin participates in the regulation of several physiological processes such as seasonal biological rhythm, daily sleep induction, aging and modulation of immunobiological defence reactions.	0.4728633320707947
Furthermore, melatonin has a highly lipophilic molecular structure facilitating penetration of cell membranes and serving as an extra- and intracellular free radical scavenger.	0.485050158316664
Melatonin seems to quench mainly hydroxyl radicals, the most damaging of all free radicals.	0.559593725054541
Melatonin may play a role in the etiology and treatment of several dermatoses e.g.	0.6168118185126908
atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.	0.42010416916031423
The influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.	0.4425142220987015
Topical application of melatonin inhibits the development of UV-erythema.	0.4538103258918755
Penetration through skin after topical application and oral bioavailability auxit further investigations on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of melatonin.	0.3278168420232622
Lung dust analyses were performed on tumor-free lung tissue from surgical samples of 28 carcinoid tumors.	0.533629802319713
The measured levels in one surgical sample may easily be correlated with the increased asbestos load of the lung due to the patients' occupation as stone mason.	0.6716915352494081
No evidence supporting the correlation of increased chronic asbestos load of the lungs and the development of typical carcinoid tumors of the lung was found.	0.6563538404088204
Analysis of 147 repeat arthroscopies of the knee performed at the Department of Surgery at the Herz-Jesu Krankenhaus, Fulda, from 1990 to 1995, showed that meniscal lesions were the most common (n = 89, 60.5%).	0.677033392807469
The majority of meniscal lesions (n = 45, 50.6%) occurred in menisci that had already been partially resected.	0.6421209300786979
The most common localization was the posterior third of the medial meniscus in ipsilateral lesions.	0.6955649629582353
Conversely, contralateral meniscal injuries were only documented in 18 cases (20.2%), while de-novo lesions occurred in 29 cases (29.2%).	0.6404173164236124
A coincidence of meniscal injury with first- or second-grade cartilage damage was documented  in 35 patients (39.3%), whereas 54 patients (60.7%) had normal intra-articular cartilage.	0.7603489450778252
Cartilage damage was most frequent in patients who had previously undergone partial meniscectomy.	0.7312780856187653
The most common therapeutic consequences were partial meniscectomy and cartilage-shaving.	0.5359737885787138
Concerning patients' postoperative satisfaction and evaluation of the results by OAK score, the majority of patients attained significant improvement in function (65.2%) and showed good or excellent outcome in the OAK score (88.8%).	0.7625967089243637
Patients without accompanying cartilage damage had better results in comparison to patients with cartilage damage in the affected area (p < 0.05).	0.5354035529381845
In conclusion, in patients with positive meniscal signs and a history of previous meniscal surgery, repeat arthroscopy is generally and early indicated and can be recommended as a valid method to assess cartilage damage objectively.	0.6531443387147886
However, patients with cartilage damage do not have the same benefit.	0.7074488488631535
The present study examined the effectiveness of combined dermatological and behavioural medicine therapy on the skin status and disease-specific stress of eighty-six patients with psoriasis and fifty-eight patients with atopic dermatitis who were hospitalized in the PsoriSol Clinic, Hersbruck, Germany.	0.6537081643905773
In addition to receiving instruction about their stain disease, the patients were offered, practice in relaxation techniques, social contacts and scratching control as well as individual psychological counselling.	0.6665351467256
The clinical change was assessed by PASI and SCORAD, respectively.	0.4109388679483677
The Marburg questionnaire for coping with skin diseases (MHF) and a questionnaire for health-related control attributes (GKÜ-S) served as psychometric measures.	0.6169202090190261
Patients showed significant improvement in skin status and psychosocial parameters in pre-post comparison.	0.47816983909058164
Social fears, avoidance and helplessness were reduced by significant improvement of the emotional status in both groups.	0.5066741440283083
Patients with psoriasis also showed an increase in internal control attributes.	0.5238948808235645
Dermatological treatment combined with behavioural medicine therapy can be considered an effective method in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.	0.6602313113009076
Treatment of chronic cancer pain with strong opioids is indicated in about 60-70 % of patients.	0.7591209081669797
Surprisingly, these very potent analgesics are prescribed with great reservations in many countries, including Germany.	0.584618935000678
The aim of our investigation was to analyse the supply of opioid analgesics to outpatients with cancer pain in the region of Hannover, which has about 1.1 million inhabitants.	0.8978554342788541
In Germany special prescription forms, i. e. triplicate forms, have to be used for the prescription of strong opioids.	0.7243808239671358
At the time when our investigation took place prescriptions for outpatients had to be renewed every 7 days.	0.5443599166404942
For two observation periods of 6 months lasting from January to June 1988 and from January to June 1991 all of the opioid prescription forms that had been issued by general practitioners for clients of the AOK Hannover (one of the major medical insurance companies) were evaluated.	0.6658093837976394
The reasons for prescribing opioids were analysed by recording the diagnosis.	0.46003715784843263
The individual treatment period on an outpatient basis during these 6 months was determined, excluding, e. g. days of hospitalization.	0.5890784724891636
During the two observation periods only 16.2 % (1988) and 19.5 % (1991) of the practitioners in the region of Hannover prescribed strong opioids to outpatients.	0.7404869600228354
The majority of the practitioners consisted of general practitioners and specialists in internal medicine.	0.5871144215998179
Although these two groups mainly function as family doctors who are responsible for the basic therapeutical needs of their patients, only 22.6-33.8 % of these doctors prescribed opioids to outpatients.	0.6925672998826622
In two-thirds of the patients, cancer pain was the reason for prescribing the drug.	0.5593538175609617
The total number of patients with a prescription for cancer pain was 164 in 1988 and 196 in 1991.	0.6433031326672054
Altogether 1002 prescription forms in 1988 and 1065 prescription forms in 1991 had been issued for these patients.	0.4664640372033806
Applied to the individual treatment period as an outpatient, only 36.0 % of the patients in 1988 and 32.1 % in 1991 received a regular prescription of strong opioids every 7 days.	0.8653968427309878
The mean time interval between separate prescriptions was 16.8  +/-  25.4 days in 1988 and 19.4  +/-  29.1 days in 1991.	0.8461214932119199
Accordingly, the majority of patients with chronic cancer pain had been supplied with opioids only occasionally.	0.7477934791317162
Our data indicate a significant undertreatment of outpatients suffering from cancer pain.	0.4308434966448584
Taking into account the estimated total number of patients suffering from cancer, only 14.5 % (1988) and 19.0 % (1991) of all outpatients in need of strong opioids were supplied sufficiently with those analgesics.	0.8186706371750905
Comparing the results from the observation period in 1988 with the results from 1991 it becomes obvious that the situation has not changed.	0.7007934117768292
There are different reasons for the insufficiency of opioid treatment: many physicians as well as their patients are still afraid of the side effects of strong opioids.	0.6843887621141865
Therefore, it is necessary to improve education concerning this issue.	0.6868185125000619
The legal restrictions on the use of narcotics and their complexity are another important reason for doctors not to prescribe strong opioids.	0.3572772632181657
In 1993 the regulations were simplified; nevertheless, this has not led to a profound change in the attitude of the prescribing practitioners.	0.5964731194097713
Thus, further changes in legislation seem to be necessary so that the requirements for the prescription of strong opioids do not differ from other drugs.	0.678804567890949
The long-term functional results of acetabular fractures are assessed in terms of the corresponding criteria of Merle-D'Aubigné and Postel (pain, mobility, walking).	0.531168430029671
Other essential criteria include the quality of reduction and the radiological appearance.	0.5791893914086667
A 53 year old female patient developed a keratoacanthoma, present on the left side of her nose for two months.	0.6860840007768932
After repeated unsuccessful trials with cryotherapy, she was treated with intralesional injection of methotrexate performed twice with a weekly internal.	0.48014916358910115
This led to complete resolution within 5 weeks.	0.38511639647867774
Although controlled studies on the effect of methotrexate in keratoacanthoma are not available, the rapid regression and the good cosmetic result suggest that this therapy may play a beneficial role in treating these lesions especially in problem locations.	0.6347733146723438
Between January 1995 and June 1996, 24 inpatients at our hospital (mean age 55.6 years) were treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).	0.7356817309839796
Clinical improvement was observed in 80% of the patients, including those without risk factors (NRG, n=16), as well as those with concomitant cardiovascular diseases (RG, n=8).	0.6523121497026566
During a mean period of observation of 224 days after the end of ECT 7 patients (35%) relapsed.	0.6115931136414061
The rate of relapse was higher in RG than in NRG patients (57.1 vs 23.1%).	0.6154147320610348
In all cases ECT was well tolerated; 285 applications of ECT did not result in mortality or persistent morbidity.	0.5240543163828634
However, RG patients may be at increased risk for the development of minor cardiovascular complications, which were noted in three RG patients (37.5%), but only in one patient (6.2%) in the NRG (Fisher's test, P=0.09).	0.8169536807914521
Taken together, our results demonstrate that ECT is a safe treatment regimen for depression even in medically ill patients of old age.	0.5905660603814816
On 21.11.1811 the poet Heinrich von Kleist and his companion Henriette Vogel were found dead in a small hollow by the Wannsee.	0.3992821669792018
The autopsy revealed that Kleist was shot in the mouth and Vogel died from a close-contact shot to the chest.	0.39566037594275905
The tragedy, which was reflected in letters and documents ended in a suicide pact.	0.5413401570420056
The conclusions of the pathologists were influenced by current medical opinions which were based on interpretations of the ancient humoral doctrine of Hypocrates.	0.34214776079001674
Subjective and objective opinions were mixed together.	0.29440308003043636
Some forensic and historical aspects of this suicide pact are highlighted.	0.39215828543385883
There is no doubt that a single emergency phone number is desirable, but in contrast to other countries, in Germany different emergency phone numbers and dispatching centers exist for the fire brigade (FB), the emergency medical service system (EMS), and the general practitioners' emergency service (GPS).	0.7517799429607743
Due to this fact, valuable time is often wasted by connecting or transferring emergency calls from one dispatching center to another.	0.3792863592885845
The purpose of this study was to analyse all calls received by the different dispatching centers in the city and county area of Mainz with respect to total number, fraction of emergency calls, and specificity.	0.6692898769034876
Further, the total number of calls potentially referring to a hypothetic single dispatching center with a general emergency phone number (112) was calculated.	0.6598793781534257
During a 4-month period, all telephone calls were registered and related to day, time, and origin of the call (city or county) and classified as non-urgent or emergency calls, calls appropriate to the dispatching center dialed, emergency calls to be transferred, or unspecific calls.	0.6964665633406462
A total of 80 987 calls were received (city area 84.3%, county area 15.7%), most of them directed to the FB of Mainz (33 086).	0.6065010280931734
The EMS dispatching center received 31 286 calls, the five GPS-centers 15 256 calls; 1359 emergency calls that were directed to the police or FB needed transfer to the EMS.	0.4501793201181349
During weekdays the EMS and FB received the most calls, with a reduced frequency on Saturdays and Sundays (Table 2).	0.5561079659419194
Nevertheless, the highest total numbers of calls were received on Saturdays due to multiple calls directed to the GPS.	0.5340216662707115
The FB had the highest specificity of calls; more than 50% of the calls to the GPS were unspecific (Fig.	0.5892975313522002
Of all calls, 4.37% were classified as emergency calls; two-thirds of these came from the area of Mainz during the daytime.	0.6881947109884949
During off-duty hours of the GPS in the city, 51% of the emergency calls reached the EMS directly; 49% had to be connected by the police or FB.	0.6866978524907568
During duty hours of the GPS, the fraction of calls directed to the EMS decreased significantly to 35%.	0.5666330589089497
During duty hours of the GPS centers in the county area, only 14% of the urgent emergency calls reached the EMS dispatcher directly (Fig.	0.5632789257804367
Compared to the multiple-center mode, a hypothetic single dispatching center for all systems would probably be followed by a slight increase in total number of calls due to the fact that the GPS numbers would be answered 24 h a day, but there would be only minimal differences in the total number received on most days; only on Sundays would a decrease be expected.	0.6606904068071657
The EMS area of Mainz, with a total of 13 different telephone numbers for 7 dispatching centers, can be regarded as typical of the German situation.	0.7833878571397768
The high number of emergency calls to be transferred (up to 86% under special circumstances) demonstrated that this weak point in the German EMS system must be eliminated by introducing a single emergency number.	0.5818857246646257
This should occur when a Europe-wide three-digit number "112" will be instituted, probably in 1995.	0.44444656859011544
Additionally, the continued existence of 5- or 10-digit telephone numbers for non-urgent calls may be useful for allowing non-verbal differentiation of calls.	0.6878349173127762
In any case, all telephone numbers, including the latter calls, have to enter one dispatching center.	0.8560685890870908
The main advantage of a single dispatching center would be avoidance of the time-consuming transfer of emergency calls from one dispatching center to the other.	0.6397914299722202

Epidemiologic data suggest that an underlying genetic disposition can be detected in up to 10 % of all colorectal cancer patients and autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is the entity most frequently identified.	0.7773337267421967
It was described first by A. Warthin in 1895 in "Family G" and is characterized by a predisposition to an early onset of colorectal cancer and other intestinal or genitourinary tumors.	0.6619771941516349
We report the case of a 61-year-old woman with five different cancers.	0.5586781842288112
Although the strict Amsterdam Criteria were not fulfilled, molecular analysis revealed HNPCC; further genetic testing in the family confirmed that the 36-year-old and so far healthy son had inherited the germline mutation of his affected mother.	0.50570896117584
Genetic testing in clinically suspected HNPCC cases is recommended for patients with colorectal cancer meeting the Amsterdam Criteria.	0.5855800118279616
In patients meeting one of Bethesda Criteria 2-7 without meeting the Amsterdam Criteria, germline mutation analysis is recommended only in MSI-positive tumors.	0.42927397972622117

The median palatine suture has long been regarded as having the greatest resistance to dilatation of the maxilla.	0.43198198979799535
In 1984 Glassman [3] presented a conservative-surgical method of division of the palatineal suture in which only the lateral and anterior support of the maxilla is debilitated surgically.	0.5424171872388652
An orthodontic apparatus cemented in place preoperatively is already used intraoperatively for dilatation of the maxilla.	0.37976485030846024
In the period from 1991 to 1997, 16 patients with a leptomaxilla and various dysnathic findings have been operated on at our clinic by the method described by Glassman [3].	0.7506207495382787
Sometimes the maxilla was dilated intraoperatively using the apparatus cemented in place by the method of Derichsweiler and dilatation was continued postoperatively until the described result was achieved.	0.4918191540687779
After successful dilatation of the maxilla and a stabilizing phase, a mono- or bimaxillary operation was performed.	0.7563987528635501
The use of this method led to the desired result in 15 patients.	0.8087903741432401
Dilatation of the maxilla was objectivized by determining the pre- and postoperative width of the anterior and posterior dental arch using models and X-ray of the occlusal overlay of the maxilla.	0.7171010116951266
In one patient who was operated on at the age of 38 years, a fracture of the alveolar process of the maxilla occurred unilaterally due to the completed ossification of the median palatine suture.	0.8072825103767453
The method of surgically aided dilatation of the maxilla at the level of Le Fort I plane is suitable for patients up to the age of 30.	0.6458062098895415
In older patients, the median palatine suture should be transsected as well.	0.5646802280517157

Pathogenesis: Arteriosclerosis and Mönckeberg's disease mediasclerosis are vascular diseases associated with calcification of the artery wall.	0.340076936335708
While mediasclerosis in most cases develops in type 2 diabetic patients, arteriosclerosis is the result of a combination of different vascular risk factors.	0.5687358805958184
Möncheberg's mediasclerosis typically involves the tunica media, whereas arteriosclerosis-associated calcifications primarily involve the intima.	0.4167142105533454
The new technique of non-invasive magnetic resonance (MR) sialography was evaluated for normal and various pathologic conditions of the parotid gland.	0.5519426160165458
Ten volunteers and 15 patients with various symptomatic diseases of the parotid gland were tested in the present study.	0.6317649413861225
Diseases included pleomorphic adenoma, cystadenolymphoma, carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, ductal carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, lymphoepithelial carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, sialolithiasis, sialadenitis, Heerfordt's syndrome and congenital duct ectasies.	0.40257505189947235
In addition to the usually performed T1 and T2 cross-sectional sequences a heavily weighted T2 sequence (TR 3600, TE 800) was performed and allowed depiction of a fluid-filled parotid duct.	0.5959661255586925
Results showed that the main parotid and primary branching ducts were depicted reliably in all normal cases and all patients, except one with sicca syndrome.	0.5663606693399718
Pathological conditions such as duct dilatations, duct strictures, obstructing duct calculus and irregular shapes and courses of the ductal system were demonstrable.	0.3384801030571311
While X-ray sialography obtained a higher resolution, only MR sialography was able to depict dilated ducts proximal from a complete obstruction, as well as all ductal cysts.	0.5103549292017666
Our findings show that MR sialography can be applied successfully to investigations of the parotid gland system.	0.49754960389314956
There have been no contraindications or complications to date because MR sialography is non-invasive.	0.5089728477186474

For treatment planning a new kind of planning program is required that can calculate the 2 D-intensity matrices for each photon field.	0.4229408495002305
At the German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum) such a program has been developed under the name of "KonRad" (Conformal Radiotherapy).	0.6120699450675989
Although it is an independent application, it is proposed for clinical usage to supplement a planning system that is already present.	0.640634613303006
So-called inverse planning differs from conventional 3 D planning, as the trial-and-error approach for finding good field parameters is nearly completely avoided.	0.5317245643241338
Instead, the radio-oncologist is given the chance directly to specify medically oriented criteria like the prescription dose in the target volume, maximal tolerance dose values for each organ at risk and their weighting factors.	0.5594141825203732
In addition, the so-called DVH optimization allows aimed, partial overdosage, especially in parallelly structured organs in order to obtain better overall planning results.	0.5464139438939332

In a chromosome analysis (47,xx, + mar de novo) an extrachromosome was detected.	0.4232743773857136
Using fluorescence in situ hybridization the supernumerary marker refered to chromosome 22.	0.35951188422471697
In the literature only a few cases show all the characteristic features of cat eye syndrome.	0.7598109323411093
However, there are only two case reports of children without any ocular alterations.	0.8069447704907846
The great variability in the phenotype probably depends on different sizes of the marker chromosome or asymmetric breakpoints on the long arm of chromosome 22.	0.42489103186091637
According to new literature reports there is no correlation between the phenotypic variability and the size of the marker chromosome.	0.6119396854661608

Objective: Elevated levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been reported after cardiac operation, during inflammatory process and cardiac allograft rejection.	0.7816828257414415
Although several groups proved the evidence of a negative inotropic effect, the actual mechanism is not completely understood.	0.673173366211024
Speaking generally it is possible that low molecular weight proteins are capable of altering myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus.	0.5142252704792064
Therefore this study analyzes whether IL-1 and/or IL-6 influence myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus.	0.6008918696223456
Methods: During aorto-coronary bypass operation, human muscle fibers were excised (n=32) and skinned using Triton-X-100.	0.5261927092904226
The experimental skinned fiber model excludes membrane-related factors such as receptor activation and provides direct examination of the contractile apparatus itself.	0.4364341225421964
Different concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 were applied (pIL-1/IL-6 1-2x10-5-10-11M).	0.5675391687864323
Force generation, calcium sensitivity, and velocity of force generation and relaxation were measured.	0.5061074199383777
(Experiments were carried out at optimal length, bath temperature 23 °C, and isometric conditions.)	0.43168771792792154
Results: None of the skinned muscle preparations of the human myocardium showed under the given experimental setup a significant change in contractility and relaxation after exposure to IL-1 and IL-6.	0.5479432321524166
Despite using nonphysiologic concentrations of IL-1 and IL-6 (pIL-1/IL-6 10-5M) no significant effect occurred.	0.6186729733745311
Furthermore no difference in calcium-sensitivity of the contractile proteins following addition of IL-1 and IL-6 could be observed.	0.6427432246876684
Conclusions: Thus, there is no experimental evidence for direct modulation of the contractile apparatus by IL-1 or IL-6.	0.6590207858753634
Given these results it is possible to exclude some potentially negative inotropic cascades that are mediated on the level of the contractile apparatus as the molecular mechanism.	0.5113596617597519
These data show that therapies which support myocardial contractility during sepsis by stimulation of the contractile proteins do not seem to be very promising.	0.580468273680762
Indications for intercarpal and radiocarpal resectionarthroplasty and fusions are osteoarthritis, KIEHNBÖCK'S disease, rheumatoid arthritis and several posttraumatic disorders of the wrist joint.	0.42207723846677236
The resection of carpal bones leads to severe instability patterns of the wrist.	0.5701402865810108
In conclusion we recommend resection-arthroplasty just for treatment of the thumb carpo-metacarpal osteoarthritis.	0.5663785053189828
Implant resection arthroplasty of the lunate and scaphoid or total wrist implants are still causing multiple problems regarding heavy load.	0.43417977308222316

Of the limited carpal arthrodeses the scaphotrapezium-trapezoid arthrodeses is the most frequent performed procedure.	0.4723403052832918
It can be indicated for STT-osteoarthritis, KIEHNBÖCK's disease, scapho-lunate instability and scaphoid pseudarthrosis if other surgical procedures had failed presuming there are no signs of arthrosis in the radiocarpal joint.	0.49123514631975623
Persisting pain especially in heavy work is quite frequent after limited arthrodesis but can be greatly releaved by simultaneous wrist denervation.	0.34879238453415806
In advanced cases of osteoarthritis total wrist arthrodesis is still the best choice for the patient.	0.6467487308804144
Increasing numbers of monitors at the anaesthesiologist's workplace, providing more than 20 different parameters of the patient's condition, have already made it impossible to record all the values in a handwritten form.	0.6803218763061968
Consequently, this most common method of record-keeping must be incomplete and inaccurate.	0.4910610379448463
In recent years computerised data-acquisition systems have been introduced into clinical practice in order to produce more reliable records.	0.6093207779689337
But after a 7-year experience in the use of such a system in cardiac anaesthesia, we have recognised certain problems that remain to be solved before automated record-keeping will achieve wider acceptance.	0.651643324145711
The first is the handling problem, which was discussed in a previous paper [11].	0.568308447059357
The second major problem is the appearance of artifacts, caused mainly by mechanical manipulations during the operation.	0.6128363550309145
In this paper, 300 courses of anaesthesia that were recorded on-line during different cardiac surgery procedures were examined and the incidence as well as the kind of artifacts occurring were evaluated.	0.611501245777437
Algorithms were developed for each haemodynamic parameter to suppress these artifacts automatically by a subsequent analysing process; the efficiency of that "artifact filter" was validated in 35 of the 300 cases.	0.5193945651057764
Based on more than 30,000 values for each parameter, the incidence of artifacts was 3%-7%.	0.7599794934144976
However, only 0.1%-0.5% of the artifacts could not be eliminated by the filter.	0.8282576963647922
The method described here provided acceptable graphic printouts of the most important haemodynamic parameters (Figs.	0.567635503272169
1b and 2b) and would also be suitable to serve as an input filter for automatically running anaesthesia data-examination processes, which are currently being developed in our clinic.	0.734939377112852
Extracorporal shock wave application (ESWA) has been used in the treatment of stones located in kidneys, bile, pancreas and the glandula parotis.	0.4927696213375012
In the last 2 years several studies have shown the benefit of the ESWA on the treatment of soft tissue disorders.	0.7324124941016789
The aim of this study was to explore the effect of high energy extracorporal shock waves in patients with painful calcaneus spurs.	0.5336738483246584
83 patients who underwent medicophysical treatment without benefit were treated with 3000 impulses of 0,30 mJ/mm2.	0.5175254162299313
Follow-ups after 12 weeks and 12 months showed that 51 of 83 patients became pain-free and 20 patients improved from the treatment.	0.6913159923940243
The results are showing the benefit of the high energy extracorporal shock wave application in the treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis.	0.8337183553943742
In developed countries, medical conditions, rather than lack of food, are the main contributors to malnutrition.	0.697658375251191
Undernutrition is especially common in older persons, occuring in 5-12 % of community-dwelling older persons, in 30-61 % of hospitalized older persons, and in 40-85 % of persons in long-term care institutions.	0.8797974955888355
The multi-factorial nature of undernutrition in the elderly forces a structured differential diagnostic approach to determine underlying causes.	0.50582446947673
Heightened physician awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment is imperative to prevent the sequalae of undernutrition.	0.46953747246497063
This structured approach to the differential diagnosis is essential to evaluate potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.	0.6806754465484868
The number of surgical procedures performed as day surgery has significantly increased in recent years.	0.5735026824453296
Therefore, a safe and short postoperative recovery period has become increasingly important.	0.6561237425439895
The aim of the present study was to investigate perioperative cognitive and physiological function after oral premedication with low-dose midazolam (3.75 mg), especially during the postoperative period.	0.8575630454567748
Heart failure may be defined as a reduced physical per-formance frequently caused by a defect in myocardial contraction.	0.5916766485281602
According to the New York Heart Association, the severity of heart failure is classified into four grades (NYHA I-IV).	0.6293223757707092
Predominantly underlying causes are coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathies and valvular heart diseases.	0.3982676032536361
Psychic disorders were studied with a naturalistic design in 125 consecutive patients of a medical-geriatric department in a general hospital.	0.5805278342381598
Based on the clinical examination and the values of the Mini-Mental-State-Examination (2), 51 patients were classified as unable for diagnostic procedures concerning psychic state.	0.6978986650134978
The other 74 patients underwent these diagnostic procedures including clinical investigation and three screening-scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11); Hospital Anxiety and Depression-Scale (4)).	0.5366973995443562
If these examinations led to the suspicion that a patient suffered from a psychic disorder, an interview was performed by a psychotherapist with experience in gerontopsychosomatic treatment and information was collected from the medical and nursing staff.	0.741037876882314
Dementia was detected or excluded by neuropsychological tests.	0.26062163539143385
Psychic disorders were found in 41 patients, mostly adaptation disorders and depressions, the disorder was estimated to be relevant for the whole hospital therapy.	0.7462694367835889
The screening instruments turned out to be reliable, so they can be recommended for further use.	0.7175770104564397
Difficult to answer remains the question, how the treatment of the psychic disorders - in our sample necessary for each 5th to 6th patient - can be implemented in a medical-geriatric department.	0.7654530787140366
Based on the "Trauma Registry" of the German Society of Trauma Surgery, an interclinical quality management (QM) system was implemented.	0.7381685591326002
The principles of the QM system as well as the differences in the quality of outcome and treatment are presented.	0.7474911739566682
The analysis uses the data on 2,069 severely injured (ISS = 22  +/-  14) patients from 20 hospitals collected prospectively and anonymously between 2/93 and 12/97.	0.615106645818643
Outcome quality was analyzed by the TRISS method and Z-statistics.	0.4536800947756985
The Z-value of the whole series was -0.24.	0.6918770374132569
There were three hospitals with more than 150 patients that had a Ps value calculated by the TRISS method.	0.5603443013922184
Clinic A had a good (-2.49), clinic B an average (-0.3) and clinic C (3.62) an adverse Z-value.	0.8637773089174356
The assessment of treatment quality was performed by criteria concerning both preclinical and acute clinical phases.	0.5278336282577119
Clinic C had a prolonged preclinical treatment time (90 min vs 62 min in clinic A) for severely injured (ISS > 15) patients.	0.703555637500497
At the same time, the preclinical intubation rate for severe thoracic trauma (AIS > 3) was lower (44 %) in clinic C than in A (62 %).	0.8091044367182393
With 14 min clinic A had the shortest time until basic radiological and ultrasound diagnostics were completed (X-rays of chest and pelvis and abdominal ultrasound) in cases of severe blunt trauma (ISS > 15), compared to 54 min in clinic B or 31 min in clinic C. Also, cranial computed tomography for severe traumatic brain injury (GCS < 9) was applied significantly faster in clinic A (after 36 min) than in clinic C (after 62 min).	0.7331706989843041
Delayed diagnoses were defined as the difference between the ISS at discharge and the ISS at completion of diagnostics in the emergency department; this criterion was met best by clinic A with an ISS difference of two patients compared to five in clinic B and four in clinic C.	0.6415423236355354
For invasive catheter procedures both ionic and nonionic contrast media (CM) with excellent tolerability are available.	0.4957147701098399
The governing practical factors for CM are X-ray opacity and biocompatibility.	0.3872637293362072
Tolerability of a contrast medium is governed among its physical properties by its viscosity, osmolality, and ionic concentration.	0.5267302076719822
In Germany the nonionic CM are currently preferred.	0.39569014496394644
Because of its low thrombotic complications, the ionic CM Ioxaglat is an important alternative in high risk interventions.	0.7020036841007076
In patients with known CM incompatibility, the prophylactic application of H1-receptor antagonists and corticosteroids allows catheterization safely without complications.	0.5636421151948884
In impaired renal function, hydration is the most effective prophylactic measure to be taken.	0.6777204664434172
Background: In the present study we evaluated the influence of topical miotics on intraocular pressure and the blood-aqueous barrier after uncomplicated phacoemulsification and PC-IOL implantation.	0.6772136505624398
A judgement on the patient's quality of life cannot be based solely on the information about the clinical severity of a disease.	0.6650017793342984
Very often there is no correlation between these parameters.	0.5272120018334935
It is necessary to assess the quality of life by a health status question-naire since non-life threatening diseases common in dermatology influence the quality of life very much.	0.5735112660505214
The most frequently used questionnaires are the SF-36 and the Nottingham Health Profile.	0.5763751721442222
However, these forms do not evaluate all dermatologic patients adequately.	0.47719962606196886
Therefore specific tools such as the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index) and Skindex have been established for dermatology.	0.6006802947912413
Further disease-specific questionnaires have been created to mea-sure time related changes in dermatological patients.	0.44577020785702726
We surgically treated twenty patients with axillary hyperhidrosis by liposuction using tumescent regional anesthesia.	0.2808827535706554
After a description of the surgical technique results are presented.	0.8235658764769173
Except for trivial hematomas, no complications were seen.	0.6315036919182417
Every patient noted a significant reduction of sweat gland activity in the follow up period.	0.6055349051844682
Long-term results remain to be seen.	0.7494491711860344
The value of cytogenetics performed simultaneously with histopathology was evaluated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).	0.4876760120927315
Clonal karyotype changes of the bone marrow cells supporting the histological diagnosis were found in 38/69 cases (55 %).	0.7596964185380084
The chromosome aberrations, especially complex changes, were significantly correlated to distinct histopathological findings such as atypias of the haematopoietic cell lines and myelosclerosis.	0.5933160755002037
Complex karyotype changes were further associated with short survival of the MDS patients.	0.4108525918665223
Our results demonstrate that cytogenetic analyses are helpful in supplementing the histopathological diagnoses.	0.34397417026302757
Recent developments in molecular cytogenetics even allow the detection of chromosomal aberrations in non-dividing cells from cytological preparations or tissue sections which may become available for routine diagnosis.	0.4419140860610568
In the course of 1 year, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, which may lead to pseudomembranous colitis and therefore may be very harmful in frail elderly people, was diagnosed in six patients of a geriatric clinic.	0.7225290805661706
The disease is associated with antibiotic therapy, due to an overgrowth of the intestinal flora with Clostridium difficile.	0.6468154445589616
Symptoms varied from a state of asymptomatic carriage or benign diarrhea to acute stages of the disease with severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and acute phase response.	0.5887623462155213
Diagnosis of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea was established when, in addition to typical clinical symptoms, a toxin-positive stool specimen was found.	0.5959068317196585
Oral vancomycin was effective in all cases, leading to a stop in the diarrhea and an amelioration of systemic inflammatory parameters.	0.4889353996118695
According to recent results, in order to prevent the induction of vancomycin-resistance and in view of higher treatment costs, metronidazole is considered as the drug of choice in mildly and moderately ill patients.	0.6341230525179306
This report analyzes 46 cases of personnel-to-patient transmissions of hepatitis B (HB), hepatitis C (HC) and HIV in health care settings.	0.5526184404292322
Similar circumstances were found for transmission of HB (40 cases, 404 infected patients), HC (4 cases, 224 infected patients) and HIV (2 cases, 7 infected patients).	0.7897792893489238
Cases with the highest number of transmissions (one anesthesiologist with 217 HC transmissions, and one EEG technologist with 75 HB transmissions) were attributed to poor infection control practices.	0.6215197050549748
As long as infected health care workers (HCW) adhere to general infection control measures, a risk for transmission to patients exists only from infected surgeons who perform'xposure-prone invasive procedures'.	0.4662541555290539
Whether changes in duties of infected HCW are necessary should be decided on an individual basis.	0.37482446197371655
Often, the infected personnel were assumed to have acquired the disease occupationally.	0.5397579794478112
Medical practices and devices bearing a risk of infection should constantly be reviewed with regard to risk for patients and personnel.	0.5998294533308081
The healthy newborn infant also has the right to optimal monitoring in order to detect any disturbance in postnatal adaptation as early as possible.	0.48542118876363133
The introduction of painless, simple, and yet reliable methods, e.g., pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening, has considerably improved the situation for obstetricians and midwives.	0.5989679640615085
Injuries of the spine in children rarely occur.	0.728810710844676
They amount to about 0.2 % of all fractures and dislocation and to 1.5 to 3 % of all lesions of the spine.	1.067703788318917
The younger an injured child is, the more likely it has sustained a lesion of the upper cervical spine.	0.680452138872662
This spinal segment in comparison to adults is concerned more often and accounts for 50 % of all C-spine injuries.	0.6654942022641416
Important differences between the adult spine and the spine in the child disappear with the age of 10 years.	0.7387035904437864
Later diagnostics, classification and treatment correspond widely with the principles valid in adults.	0.4331110225744035
The knowledge of the normal shape and development of the spine are crucial in avoiding misinterpretations of X-ray films.	0.7506748807959615
Typical examples include the confusion of synchondrosis with fractures or of subluxations of the atlas and the C2/C3 segment with "true" instabilities.	0.4244986724194751
Relevant lesions always are accompanied by clear clinical symptoms.	0.23084230578072562
Specific injuries of the growing axial skeleton are lesions of the cartilaginous endplates and "fractures" of the synchondrosis.	0.5826464028536825
Although a variety of histologic entities were described, primary tumors of the trachea are rare findings.	0.6127247793514149
Over a period of 20 years, 30 patients underwent 31 tracheal resections in two hospitals for thoracic surgery.	0.48392053914984856
Among them 4 patients had thyroid carcinoma involving the trachea.	0.29794232693290856
In these patients a strumectomy combined with tracheal resection was performed.	0.5573662040548181
One re-operation for erosion bleeding of the innominate artery on the 8th postoperative day was successfully performed.	0.41768820795503325

Principles, methods and results of percutaneous therapy in acute and chronic vascular alterations of the subclavian artery and its branches.	0.6832321617136625
Speculations concerning a possible association between temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and ear symptoms of otalgia and tinnitus have been made in the dental and medical literature for a long time.	0.6063191724497381
Current understanding of this association is reviewed.	0.2659227499895665
An analysis of relevant studies published between 1947 and 1996 shows that a relatively high percentage of TMD patients reported the presence of ear pain and noise.	0.4960951927789838
However, a cause-effect relationship has not been established to date.	0.787195474921468
Theories that try to explain the concurrence of TMD symptoms and ear symptoms (particularly tinnitus) by a common underlying cause remain speculative.	0.5768946291942497
It has to be taken into consideration that due to their high prevalence, TMDs and ear symptoms in a given patient may be present by chance alone.	0.624721821724663
A methodological weakness of most of the studies available is the fact that control groups were not considered.	0.5809856695389225
Owing to the lack of prospective, controlled, and randomized studies, statements regarding the effectiveness of certain dental measures for the treatment of otalgia and tinnitus in TMD patients are not well supported.	0.6072797956724728
Our report describes a 46-year-old woman with self-inflicted oedema of the left leg and the left arm.	0.7488288339823755
She induced leg oedema by an elastic bandage tourniquet and arm oedema by holding her arm dependent and immobile.	0.30089567664107064
A preexisting disorder of the affected leg (postthrombotic syndrome) and of the affected arm (hypoesthesia subsequent to surgical injury of the plexus brachialis) delayed the diagnostic proceedings.	0.7261412777328138
Our case report shows that: -  Confirmed presence of organic disease does not exclude limb oedema of self-inflicted origin.	0.7210293957443066
-  Oedema resulting from a tourniquet and "hysterical oedema" can be developed by one and the same patient.	0.743982548654139
-  Effective care of such patients is only possible if dermatologist and psychiatrist work together all the time (liaison psychiatry).	0.572379221680393
Purpose: This study was conducted to control improvement in the high preoperative prevalence of TMJ symptoms in patients treated by long-term orthodontic therapy for class II malocclusion.	0.8559527485934934
Patients and methods: A total of 57 patients were examined at least 8 years after surgery, 37 having received orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery and 20 surgery but without orthodontic treatment.	0.6135422384503345
Myofunctional, disk and condylar symptoms were recorded according to the Krough-Poulsen scheme.	0.35294489783588817
Results: Both groups showed a normal maximal interincisal distance.	0.6018765342123987
The deviation during the opening movement was mainly sigmoidal in the group with orthodontic treatment and terminal in the other group.	0.6221112218353322
Muscular pain predominated in the group without orthodontic treatment.	0.5455663253636001
Clicking sounds of the TMJ were registered in 70% of both groups.	0.6952647378809503
Occlusal interference and a higher interocclusal distance when speaking were found more often in patients without orthodontic treatment.	0.6189768722552615
Preoperatively, clicking and crepitation sounds had been recorded in 60% of both patients groups.	0.6304925694441966
Conclusion: In conclusion, a high postoperative prevalence of TMJ dysfunction symptoms was found in patients with class II malocclusion 8-10 years after orthognathic surgery with or without orthodontic treatment.	0.7513617245396438
Both groups often exhibited TMJ clicking and crepitation sounds, whereas the patients that had not received orthodontic treatment had a higher prevalence of occlusal interference and muscular pain.	0.5318173211967892
The synthesis of pS 2 protein is induced through estrogen-dependent transcription of the pS 2 gene.	0.4414165637837446
The presence of the pS 2 protein in breast cancer is thought to be as valuable as receptor status, or even more so, in predicting the response to hormonal therapy.	0.7044892953293359
Furthermore, pS 2 appears to be a prognostic factor for primary breast cancer.	0.6577625979055901
In 162 cases of primary breast cancer, pS 2 was tested by immunohistochemical procedures on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues.	0.48602249922708646
Staining was evaluated semiquantitatively using an immunoreactive score (IRS).	0.3828207350369793
The concentrations of pS 2 in tumor cytosol were determined using an immunoradiometric assay.	0.461042979023266
Positive staining for pS 2 (IRS >= 2) was seen in 27 % of the tumors.	0.8699421217413733
Comparison of immunohistochemical and biochemical detection (26 % of tumors had pS 2 cytosol concentrations above the cut-off value of 26 ng/mg cell protein) revealed an 81 % concordance rate (r = 0.76; P < 0.0001).	0.6079159996433
Univariate analysis showed no significant correlation of immunohistochemical pS 2 detection and age or menopausal status of patients, tumor size, tumor grade or nodal status.	0.6472207964151749
However, the immunohistochemical pS 2 status correlated significantly with the immunohistochemical detection of the estrogen (ER; P < 0.001) and progesterone receptor status (PR; P < 0.0001).	0.6031845047982208
pS 2-positive tumors were ER-positive in 66 % of cases and PR-positive in 73 %; 89 % of pS 2-positive tumors were positive for ER and/or PR.	0.7870587439576233
The incidence of immunohistochemical pS 2 detection was 41 % in the group of steroid receptor positive carcinomas (ER- and/or PR-positive) in contrast to 7 % in steroid receptor negative tumors (ER- and PR-negative).	0.7981209136806416
Patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting may develop acute myocardial infarction late after surgery.	0.5825828237384126
It is not exactly known in these patients whether acute infarction is predominantly caused by occlusion of bypass or native vessels.	0.5512508615754984
Also, there is no systematic and prospective data available with respect to an invasive, revascularizing therapeutic approach.	0.5290977306613917
Therefore, acute coronary angiograms were obtained in 21 consecutive patients with acute infarctions and remote bypass grafting to elucidate mechanisms causing myocardial infarction in these patients, and to assess results of catheter-based recanalization.	0.822285804736207
We report the clinical and laboratory results of a family where one boy and one girl presented with a clinical picture resembling the X-linked agammaglobulinemia known as Bruton's disease.	0.7816197406742597
Both children showed severe bacterial infections starting at the age of around 6 months, a lack of all immunoglobulin classes and absence of mature B-cells in the peripheral blood.	0.5859743621084476
With respect to reports from the literature these results are yet another indicator for the existence of an autosomal-recessiv disorder with the same clinical make-up as Bruton's disease.	0.5598959002395397
A deletion on chromosome 14 leading to the disorder was identified.	0.5086975682725189
Conservative treatment of genuine stress urinary incontinence in females gained more and more interest.	0.44675636690300813
The use of mini-devices is one of the newly developed therapeutical options however, its clinical relevance and longterm-results are still under debate.	0.6682492162614714
This review article gives a critical evaluation of the available urethral plugs and regulators and new developments as well according to the longterm-follow-up studies in the literature and own experience with those devices.	0.772135165727325
The continence rates that can be obtained with the different plugs or regulators are dependent upon the degree of stress incontinence, ability to insert the plug and compliance of the patient.	0.6134956063914628
Reported longterm results vary between 48 % and 100 %.	0.749405897440926
The most frequent side effects are urinary infection, haematuria and/or handling problems with the devices.	0.6023274720616973
According to the published material it is impossible to give therapeutical standards for treatment of female stress urinary incontinence with urethral mini-devices.	0.5290144921141093
Although proper Patient selection might give excellent longterm-results in patient continence rates.	0.3577079876079441
Background: In contrast to the correction of simple myopia there is no widely accepted technique for the correction of myopic astigmatism.	0.6670448924578407
Currently two techniques are available: the photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK) and the combination of arcuate keratotomies with standard PRK (PRK-T).	0.5959629428582547
Although there are randomized data for CABG vs. medical therapy and CABG vs. PTCA in primary therapy of CAD, there is few evidence on the appropriate therapy of recurrent angina after prior CABG.	0.5348752307436608
We analyzed data from 1265 consecutive patients (PTS.)	0.497071452734436
presenting for recurrent angina after previous CABG who required either re-CABG (n=67), PTCA (n=768) or medical therapy alone (medRx) (n=430) at our institution during 1986 through 1996.	0.5731084275837212
Outcome after index therapy is monitored during 45  +/-  34 months.	0.5130403020029349
The 3 therapeutic groups were similar with respect to gender (84 % male), age at therapy (60 years), prevalence of diabetes (22 %), and time to first ischemic event after primary CABG (37 months).	0.7026557661036604
Actuarial survival was significantly higher in the PTCA-group at 1, 5 and 10 years after therapy of recurrent angina, despite the freedom from subsequent re-intervention was significantly lower (1-year-survival 95 % [37 %] vs. 95 % [3] medRx vs. 79 % [4 %] re-CABG, 5-year-survival 87 % [57 %] vs 78 % [17 %] medRx vs. 50 % [4 %] re-CABG and 10-year-survival 72 % [65 %] vs. 63 % [31 %] medRx vs. 50 % [15 %] re-CABG resp., p < 0.0001, [numbers in brackets represent corresponding values for incidence of re-intervention, p < 0.0001]).	0.923410869805057
These findings were similar after adjustment for different baseline characteristics.	0.4342048704981464
Due to advances in surgical methods, such as miniplate and lag screw osteosynthesis, there is current discussion about the adequate therapy of condylar fractures.	0.5110123525504587
Regarding the insufficient outcome of conservative treatment confirmed by refined methods of functional diagnosis, there is a trend towards surgical therapy, at least in cases of condylar displacement out of the fossa.	0.7225790102446829
This trend was also prompted when surgeons learned that the condyle determines local growth but does not serve as a growth center of the mandible.	0.49572027434272947
Along with increased interest in temporomandibular function and surgical therapy of internal disorders, surgical therapy of traumatic soft tissue lesions was emphasized.	0.605650274390465
This consequently led to surgical restoration of intraarticular fractures.	0.29597748749123093
Conservative treatment will nonetheless be sufficient in cases of minor displacement due to a higher ability of remodeling, even more so in children.	0.6685002386377348
A case of a 37-year-old woman with symmetrical bilateral apocrine hidrocystomas at the lateral margins of the eyelids is presented.	0.6246017811079924
The symmetrical, simultaneous and bilateral appearance of the lesions, the lack of association with other abnormalities and the absence of the lesion in the family history make this case remarkable.	0.7451152576890536
The situation of intensive care units (ICU) in Germany was analyzed by a national survey.	0.9255635692803189
Questionnaires consisting of multiple-choice and short-answer questions were sent to ICUs of university hosptitals, hospitals with >1000 beds, 500-1000 beds, and hospitals with <500 beds separately with regard to the different disciplines (anesthesia ICUs, surgical ICUs, cardiac surgical ICUs, neurosurgical ICUs, neurological ICUs, mixed-surgical ICUs, internal ICUs, interdiscipline ICUs).	0.6093946766266876
The personality organisation and the process of therapy of drug-addicted patients are examined by the comparative analysis of 15 single cases.	0.5743451771838682
The antisocial tendency is emphasised as the main clinical feature.	0.44315068000899505
It is related to specific genetic traumata and the externalisation of parts of the superego.	0.451803713914889
During the therapeutical process, the antisocial tendency destroys the therapeutical relation.	0.49741409753055293
If it is possible to continue therapy beyond this point, the patients can now enter into a process, in which new identifications and the integration of parts of the superego are involved.	0.747333626207821
Approaching the end of the therapy, patients, again, tend to destroy the results of therapy if one does not consider specific problems of the separation process.	0.6714610259679047
Objective: The Uppsala-definition of leukoplakia has recently redefined oral leukoplakia.	0.3983795922773422
Based on this definition, the aim of our study was to reevaluate the prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with histologically proven primary oral cancer.	0.6959983355598244
Design: A total of 101 inpatients in four tumor centers in Berlin were interviewed and clinically examined just prior to surgery of an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).	0.5104645752566566
Results: The prevalence of leukoplakia immediately adjacent to the carcinoma was 15.8%.	0.6519733698898215
Additional leukoplakias without relation to the carcinoma were found in 4% of the patients.	0.8153086865148252
There were no significant differences in age- or sex-distribution, history of tobacco habits or diet  between patients with or without leukoplakia.	0.7845928998840017
T1 carcinomas were found in 62.5% of patients with, and 24.4% of patients without associated leukoplakia, whereas a balanced distribution was found for the pre-operative staging of the tumor.	0.8861465793433638
Conclusions: The prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with OSCC was low, compared to retrospective studies.	0.5396665036229068
The presence or absence of leukoplakia indicated no influence on the prognosis of the tumor, except of tumor size.	0.6684601691388387
The results emphasize that most OSCC develop from healthy appearing oral mucosa.	0.28595660491950353
Cutaneous angiosarcomas mainly arise on the scalp and face of older patients.	0.3786712058153347
They present with reddish nodules or plaques and tend to bleed and ulcerate.	0.24717338178253592
Angiosarcomas show an aggressive and recurrent course and have a high potential for metastasis.	0.6290898084105182
We report on a 48-year-old patient with unilateral eyelid edema as the first manifestation of an angiosarcoma.	0.7113485656194493
The clinical presentation, the history of contact allergy, the presence of antinuclear antibodies, and abnormal thyroid function tests favoured a non-neoplastic disease.	0.7023087208840719
However, multiple biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of a highly differentiated angiosarcoma.	0.8231305323561305
Staging of the patient revealed no metastasis.	0.944299510150137
After radical surgery including orbital exenteration and postoperative radiation therapy, no recurrence was observed with a follow up of 26 months.	0.6298139777038725
This case underlines the importance of including angiosarcoma in the differential diagnosis of unilateral eyelid edema.	0.40264847895017175
The Marburg Cardiomyopathy Study (MACAS) is a prospective observational study designed to determine the value of the following potential non-invasive arrhythmia risk predictors in more than 200 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) over a 5-year-follow-up period: New York Heart Association functional class, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and ejection fraction, left bundle branch block and atrial fibrillation on ECG, QTc and JTc-dispersion on 12-lead ECG, abnormal time-domain analysis and spectral turbulence analysis of the signal-averaged ECG, ventricular arrhythmias and heart-rate variability on 24-hour Holter ECG, baroreflex sensitivity, and microvolt T wave alternans during exercise.	0.6247715089359851
Abstract   The observation of extremely variable clinical courses for patients with renal cell carcinomas of an identical pathological stage as well as a comparable histological differentiation resp.	0.6862588099680218
growth pattern strongly indicates the existence of tumors harboring different biological aggressiveness.	0.2999689590710182
Currently available histopathological classification systems do not predict the biological behaviour of renal cell cancer as sufficiently as the establishment of a therapeutical strategy adjusted to the individual patient would require.	0.6358826784372054
The need for a more refined characterization of the biological potential of the indidual tumor results from the introduction of modified operative strategies as organ-preserving surgery, for example, as well as from the recently suggested application of an adjuvant systemic therapy adapted to the individual risk for tumor recurrence resp.	0.653564670090774
the development of progressive disease.	0.33170526217566904
Therefore, the clinically orientated basic scientist and the basic scientifically orientated clinician intensively try to determine prognostically important biological variables which would allow to better predict the biological aggressiveness of a single tumor in addition to "classical" prognostic parameters (T-stage, histological grading, growth patterns).	0.6296137782310193
In this context, several biological parameters including the identification of alterations on the DNA-, RNA- and protein level have been discussed as possible biological prognostic markers for renal cell cancer.	0.6204608876436128
The present review tries to reflect currently available biological characteristics of RCC which might gain clinical importance with regard to an individualized therapy in the near future.	0.4965656009238259
Until now reports of factitious disease have not been found in the ENT literature.	0.7089347512191754
In contrast, the dermatologic literature estimates an incidence from 0.01 to 0.26%.	0.6998681943970442
In order to achieve effective treatment for these patients, knowledge of the characteristic symptoms is fundamental.	0.631572815525017
The present paper describes the variety of disease possible, using three cases treated between 1992 and 1994 in the ENT Department of Cologne.	0.6594864118216974
According to the literature, females are involved in a ratio of 9:1, with the majority working in medically related professions.	0.7127436488585778
Depression and anorexia are typical symptoms.	0.24783944222256368
When a factitious disease is suspected, psychiatric consultation is essential.	0.47732692896723977
Confrontation of a suspect patient by the otolaryngologist is not often considered because several reports quote suicidal behavior in up to 25% of self-manipulating patients and tendencies to refuse to follow psychiatric treatment are considerable.	0.5080370410487098
Numerous different diseases lead to scarring alopecia with irreversible follicular destruction as a common ending.	0.40769508029130663
Current classifications are based on clinical, histopathological or prognostic parameters, as well as on pathogenetic criteria which allow only a rough assessment because the precise mechanisms leading to scarring alopecia are still unknown.	0.4917605079056191
Inadequacies of the established classifications are obvious when regarding special forms of scarring alopecia like lichen planopilaris or pseudopelade Brocq.	0.3717242770698284
In order to develop more satisfying classifications, recent insights into biology and pathology of the hair follicle and follicular cycling have to be considered.	0.616744397952496
The most important structures for the survival of the hair follicle are the epithelial stem cells which reside in the follicular bulge and the fibroblasts of the dermal papilla including the molecular communication between these two cell populations.	0.5810619885457209
Research in the field of scarring alopecia should aim at defining the pathological processes on any of the above mentioned levels which will lead to an irreversible damage of the hair follicle thus allowing the development of new therapeutic agents.	0.6598156861911517
Rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis is a rare dermatologic disorder seen in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.	0.6415774108309571
Clinically firm erythematous 3-5 mm papules are found mainly on the arms, the hips and the proximal thighs.	0.660931086967519
The lesions may be pruritic leading to excoriations and crusts.	0.3410473378368936
Histology reveals a dense dermal infiltrate with neutrophilic granulocytes, while leukocytoclasia may be seen, vasculitits is not observed.	0.48528794933768443
This overview of rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis may help remind the practioner to include this uncommon disorder in the differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis-related dermatoses.	0.4607133518438556
Background: The rehabilitation of low vision patients is of increasing importance since the number of these patients has grown rapidly.	0.7369284673489748
We wanted to evaluate the actual spectrum of patients concerning age and diagnoses and the appropriate low vision aids (LVA) in 1 year.	0.6049015170913655
It is generally accepted that most inguinal hernias should be operated electively.	0.4594708825133289
This study presents a risk calculation challenging this view.	0.36108256628619284
Three strategies are presented: prophylactic indication on principle (A), elective operation in every second case (B), and operation in case of strangulation only (C).	0.5490626767164214
On the basis of available epidemiological data it is calculated that, for the male German population aged 65 years and over 69 954 (A), 36 292 (B), and 2630 (C) inguinal hernia repairs would be necessary annually; 167 (A), 145 (B) and 123 (C) perioperative deaths would occur, connected with 1702 (A), 1373 (B) and 1048 (C) years of life lost, respectively.	0.5558893310166629
Thus, operation of every inguinal hernia would result in a (small) reduction of life expectancy.	0.743026592114023
These data provide evidence that in elderly patients the indication for operative treatment of inguinal hernias should depend upon symptoms and suffering.	0.6123768570873446
There is no reason to operate on asymptomatic patients because of a presumed risk of strangulation.	0.6551687611129269
Since first described by Kibler (1955) hyperalgetic areas of the skin in company with arthropathy or diseases of internal organs are known to be a useful sign to define the affected segment.	0.7195031000298758
While seldom utilized by physicians, physiotherapists frequently make use of these special findings concerning the skin as a common part of their daily work.	0.5612082925405922
A certain problem exists in ranging correctly the corresponding segment of the spine, this mostly caused by the inaccurate idea of anatomical facts.	0.5550794846239853
The actual as well as the former literature in this field shows very different views and opinions, all of them rather in contrast to the real anatomical findings.	0.6929953065185138
In the following the topographic-anatomic conditions are presented of which exact knowledge is necessary to evaluate the palpation's result "Kibler's plica positive" relative to its diagnostic valence.	0.5652834398307303
Aim of the study and methods: In the present study the correlation between ischemia induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias and a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials was investigated.	0.7806235330754229
In 16 patients with significant coronary artery disease and survived sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia an electrophysiologic study (EPS) was performed.	0.6926077340296152
Before EPS (t1), at every stimulation interval and after induction of a ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) the lactate concentration was measured in arterial blood and in the coronary sinus for calculation of the myocardial lactate extraction.	0.7114166015723402
Furthermore, before investigation, after induction of a VT/VF and after a 10 minute recovery phase an analysis of the signal averaged ECG was performed.	0.6733584099944935
Nine patients showed a so-called "lactate reversal", i.e., an increase of the lactate concentration in the coronary sinus over the concentration of the arterial blood as an expression of ischemia development, during inducibility of a VT/VF (group A).	0.703975463626226
The control group consisted of 7 patients without ischemia related VT/VF (group B).	0.574082737305922
Results: In group A significant changes of the three late potential criteria were found between t1 and t2 (QRS:115.61 +/- 13.86 vs. 126.06 +/- 16.74, p=0.08; RMS: 25.81 +/- 22.26 vs. 13.11 +/- 10.72, p=0.01; LAS: 37.72 +/- 19.26 vs. 50.06 +/- 10.72, p=0.01).	0.6440344795828272
In group B, no significant changes could be measured.	0.8059768050502724
Furthermore, the prevalence of late potentials increased in group A from 66% (t1) to 89% (t2), whereas in group B no increase was detectable.	0.8152924230685274
Conclusions: These data suggest a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials in correlation with the inducibility of ventricular tycharrhythmias due to ischemic circumstances.	0.5678185157072703
Therefore the dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials can be an expression of a modification of the arrhythmogenic substrate in arrhythmia endangered patients.	0.463565555496484
Recent studies and reviews continue to report a high mortality associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which involves a severe inflammatory reaction within the whole lung that is frequently associated with multiple-organ failure.	0.5676013231536332
Important factors contributing to the poor results in severe ARDS are the aggressive procedures required to maintain sufficient arterial oxygenation, such as mechanical ventilation with high inspiratory pressures and high inspired oxygen concentrations (FiO2) which themselves contribute to the progression of the disease.	0.5636272933989814
As no specific therapy that reduces or prevents the general inflammatory reaction is known, current therapy is limited to procedures that minimize peak inspiratory pressures and FiO2.	0.5324934442583695
Therefore, pressure- and volume-limited ventilation modes with positive end-expiratory pressure, controlled hypercapnia, differential lung ventilation when appropriate, positioning (particularly prone), and aggressive dehydration are used.	0.6308278603838646
Should these procedures fail to improve arterial gas exchange, the patients may be additionally treated by veno-venous extracorporeal gas exchange.	0.5556834667343841
To reduce the risk of severe haemorrhagic complications due to high levels of systemic heparinization, systems internally coated with covalently bound heparin, which allow a lower level of systemic anticoagulation, should be used.	0.5978519469939797
From April 1989 to August 1993, 89 patients were transferred to our intensive care unit for treatment of severe ARDS; 52 were treated by combining the described conventional methods without artificial gas exchange (survival rate 88%) and 37 additionally underwent artificial gas exchange (survival rate 57%).	0.612769503006663
The overall survival rate was 75%.	0.5658086310819309
On the basis of these experiences, we conclude that this step-by-step approach may improve survival in patients with severe ARDS.	0.6982518791199913
Cutis marmorata teleangiectatica congenita (CMTC) is a rare congenital vascular disorder of the venous system.	0.7527040157521734
In 50% of cases there are associated anomalies of other organ systems.	0.7157046426111999
Clinical improvement of the cutaneous manifestations is noted in most cases and usually occurs during the first year of life.	0.7651609428422235
We present a patient with CMTC with a band-like pattern following the L3 dermatome.	0.5759224096275022
At the age of 13 years, the skin manifestations worsened, with ulcerations and intermittent claudication.	0.7128980707783232
Angiographic imaging revealed stenosis of the deep femoral artery, and the circumflex femoral artery and the first perforating arteries were not visualized.	0.7178511241214774
To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of CMTC with anomalies of the large arteries.	0.6591280571598255
Introduction: The efficacy of vascular surgery in the treatment of popliteal arterial aneurysms (PAA) and the justification of conservative therapy was investigated in the present study.	0.8190587697300921
Materials and methods: From January 1985 to December 1996, 87 patients were operated on for PAA.	0.611763898873299
The clinical records were reviewed retrospectively and patients were categorized concerning PAA-related symptoms, vascular run-off, and material used for vascular reconstruction.	0.6048782690338655
Patients were examined, and the patency of the vascular reconstruction was checked by palpation and Doppler sonography.	0.7911889879778908
Results: The cumulative survival calculated using the Kaplan-Meier curve was 70% after 10 years.	0.7003427618567447
Asymptomatic patients had the best results and patients with acute ischemia, the worst.	0.9392875580583308
The outcome concerning patent vs. occluded run-off and autologous vs. heterologous bypass material was similar.	0.414381484524184
Conclusion: Asymptomatic and uncomplicated PAA should be treated surgically.	0.45013386090332913
Only PAA with a diameter less than 2 cm, and without thrombus on the vessel walls can be treated conservatively.	0.7246167108752359
Collodion baby is a clinical description for a transient condition of the newborn which is caused by various disorders of cornification.	0.5777486048183195
The majority of cases are due to autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis.	0.5054115309388237
In up to 10% of cases "self-healing" of the skin occurs.	1.0685799462605052
We report about a mature male baby who at birth was covered entirely with a shining, collodion-like membrane.	0.41255240200359133
There also were marked ectropion of the eyelids and eversion of the lips.	0.4020291119813861
After shedding of the membrane almost complete clearing of the skin occurred until the age of three months.	0.5821690543222587
In the case reported here skin biopsies taken on the 20th day of life showed discrete and non-specific ultrastructural changes, with no features of lamellar ichthyosis or other cornification disorders.	0.6428807482911423
Past research on the phenomenon of enhanced pain sensitivity in fibromyalgia syndome (FS) revealed evidence for both a higher pain magnitude in response to nociceptive stimuli (hyperalgesia) and a general perceptual amplification of sensations (hypervigilance).	0.579210394024578
In order to distinguish between these two aspects of disturbed sensory processing in FS, cerebral evoked potentials after brief painful laser and auditory stimuli were measured in 10 FS patients.	0.5095823139770634
Results were compared with those from age-matched painfree controls.	0.6339975732404061
Amplitudes of middle-latency (N1) and long-latency (P2) laser evoked potentials (LEPs) were significantly higher in FS than in controls.	0.6405975397006204
Furthermore, laser intensity at pain but not at sensation threshold was lower in FS than in controls.	0.4132364888676083
However, auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) did not differ between groups.	0.5446875688832887
Enhanced N1 and P2 amplitudes of LEPs suggest stronger sensory and attentional processing of nociceptive information in FS, respectively.	0.312209162494373
The concept of hypervigilance is challenged by the failure to find differences in auditory perception among FS and control patients.	0.43497294626384175
Yet, the importance of unpleasant intensities of auditory stimulation, not applied in this study, to reveal abnormal non-nociceptive perceptual amplification in FS is discussed.	0.6277157025950318

The highest rate of complications (22 %) was seen in patients with distal fractures of the fibula without additional plating (of the fibula).	0.8321093576738716
There was no deep infection.	0.498357122919999
Tibial fractures close to the ankle joint can be managed by unreamed nailing.	0.7087070297517509
Distal fractures of the fibula should be stabilized by additional plating.	0.6361107078203284
Because of the unreamed technique of implantation this procedure can also be used in grade II or III open fractures.	0.6892220976961279

Normal cells demonstrate a strictly limited growth potential and senescence after a defined number of cell divisions.	0.37144619801774764
In contrast, tumor cells often exhibit an apparently unlimited proliferation potential and are termed immortalized.	0.47660396064697774
It has been proposed that the progressive shortening of the tips of the eukaryotic chromosomes - the telomeres - is an important component of senescence and is involved in the control of cell cycle.	0.8545002520155243
The enzyme telomerase adds TTAGGG repeats onto mammalian telomeres, preventing their shortening.	0.3585235698424869
Telomerase is normally inactive in most somatic cells, but detectable in tumor cells.	0.5306718183704032
The activation of telomerase in malignant cancers seems to be an important step in tumorigenesis in order to gain the ability of indefinite proliferation and to become immortal.	0.6337709267918039

PCR-based diagnosis of infectious diseases, if performed according to appropriate quality standards, is a safe and effective technique with high sensitivity and specificity and results in an etiologically based diagnosis.	0.7594179078721511
The shift of age distribution within the population of industrialized societies has led to an increased need of treating diseases in elderly patients and at the same time in a higher number of patients bearing an increased operative risk.	0.6486555582737189
Today, the development of surgical techniques and intensive care treatment enables us to carry out numerous procedures in geriatric patients.	0.6721314466720212
Innovative surgical techniques like minimal invasive surgery with minor trauma due to the surgical approach changed patient's categories, also.	0.6437847766473653
Taken together with other procedures causing less operative stress indications for patients who were not operable previously have changed.	0.5491256881786941
New developments such as organ transplantation and immunosuppression also generated totally new groups of patients with very distinct conditions for the operative procedure.	0.549696107751182
Vanishing indications or selection of patients as in peptic ulcer disease changed the surgical approach completely: Negative selection has shifted elective operative interventions in ulcer disease to emergency procedures.	0.4928289771979051
Contrasting experiences made in most other countries and especially in the third world, in Germany economic restrictions have not been encountered as of yet.	0.7480028027310782
Economical conditions, an increase in surgical procedures in elderly patients and advances in medical science will continue to change the surgical patient's characteristics profoundly.	0.6973548707418882
From the physicians viewpoint we have to actively participate in this development by personal interaction with the patient, by interdisciplinary cooperation and prompt social and political action.	0.610613332811717
Osteoid osteomas are tumors with intense clinical symptoms and extensive reactive bone changes far exceeding the volume of the lesion itself.	0.5812739611473305
Because of their small size they can be approached by minimally invasive surgical procedures.	0.5117526037465173
We treated ten symptomatic patients with osteoid osteomas (n 6 hip point, n 1 iliac bone, n 1 femoral diaphysis, n2 tibial diaphysis) by excision of the nidus with a 3-mm Harlow-Wood needle using a percutaneous CT-guided approach.	0.6612080711281533
Seven patients with residual tumor were treated with either thermocautery (n 2) or sclerosis with 1 ml of 96% ethanol (n 5).	0.918939031497221
Six patients had instant and constant relief (3 years' observation) of their pain.	0.7695334236961956
In two patients a second transcutaneous intervention was successful.	0.5912954104184341
Only two patients needed open resection.	0.5179515261283171
Compared with the invasive open resection of the tumors, sometimes even putting the stability of the femoral neck at risk, transcutaneous CT-guided enucleation of the nidus of the osteoid osteoma with additional sclerotherapy is a good alternative method, especially in the region of the femoral neck.	0.7406253435003622
We live in an epoch that could be designated as the post-Gutenberg-era.	0.38525281984039833
Writing is no longer the dominant sign system.	0.5028344924243034
It is replaced by electronic signs.	0.23734599045036317
We consider approximately the year 1950 as the turning-point between these two epochs, because by then, in the years after the 2nd World War the American households were saturated with televisions.	0.6356333619519976
Thereby, the new sign system asserted itself.	0.5968086007673387
The topic of this article is the transformation of our sign system and thereby of our worlds of symbols, the leap from the world of written signs into the world of electronic signs, and the possibility born out of it to create electronic objects, which I prefer to call virtual objects.	0.6496760166401974
The manipulation of object-choice and object-relationships accompanying this change and the role assigned to analysts in this new world will be considered as well.	0.44731918583752317
These electronic signs developed quickly a life of their own.	0.3779123873019162
A totally new class of objects came into being, the class of virtual objects.	0.47942645341426826

This procedure is accompanied by an industrialization of object-choice and object-relationships.	0.4850813411232785
The manipulated object-choice and object-relationship is born and, moreover, a displacement of natural objects through virtual ones.	0.4691076904034643
A change of the socio-cultural understanding is also a consequence of this process.	0.6064167006883608
New patterns of socio-cultural understanding develop, that could be described as industrial feudalism.	0.5558662922498588
The goal of this article is to describe the transformation of our world of signs and the connected industrialization of object relationships, and to interprete them according to our present possibilities.	0.6949358139694902
In this article 34 randomized controlled trials examining peripherally mediated opioid effects after knee surgery are discussed.	0.503017398455844
All studies examined small doses of morphine injected intraarticularly at the end of knee surgery, but not all studies did show an analgesic effect of the peripheral opioid.	0.6948830683935759
Because of differing study designs a meta-analysis of the data is not possible.	0.6190665404018614

In this brief article I attempt to sketch a few salient insights from my career as a researcher and practitioner of psychotherapy: The key to successful therapy is undoubtedly the therapist's empathic listening, coupled with a series of other positive attributes and finely honed interpersonal skills.	0.4202331324969749
On the debit side, patients' hostility frequently evokes counterhostility from the therapist which not infrequently results in a negative outcome.	0.5533675446642318
Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a procedure for inserting a tracheal cannula without a large incision, without extensive dissection of pretracheal tissue, and without exposure of the trachea.	0.6073328418395513
The early complications of the technique are usually minor and late complications are rare.	0.7323974651113407
Although it is a simple procedure, it is not a minor operation.	1.0748992612008224
Users must be familiar with the technique, the indications and contra-indications for the procedure, as well as the complications.	0.6695559409236946
Proper training of the operation and knowledge of the procedure will avoid unnecessary complications.	0.7377750939703105
Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a relatively new technique for inserting a cannula in the tracheal lumen.	0.5499512575627112

A short history, the indications and contraindications, the early and late complications of the technique, and comparisons with other techniques as well as with conventional open tracheotomy are reviewed.	0.7924532451977035
In this study, a histologic and histomorphometric analysis of delayed and immediate-placed implants was performed.	0.5241784884116454
An implantation of 16 self-cutting conical titanium screw implants was carried out in 8 beagle dogs.	0.462428317352122
Of these implants, 8 were placed immediately after extraction of the second premolar and 8 implants were placed after 6 months of healing after extraction.	0.6610246412172817
For dynamic histomorphometry, fluorochrome bone markers were injected at two different times prior to euthanasia.	0.3052957535641549
The specimens were examined macroscopically and microscopically 8 months after implantation.	0.5365740301187234
A histologic, dynamic, and static histomorphometry was performed with the aid of different computer programs.	0.7161058504487776
A mean surface of osseointegration of 75.7% and a mean soft tissue implant contact surface of 24.2% was seen in immediate-placed implants.	0.6968691751398749
For delayed implantation, an osseointegrated surface of 80.7% and a soft tissue covering of 19.3% was examined.	0.8141822049752571
The fibrogenic structures in the cervical implant part were more dense and there were more adhesive epithelial elements (hemidesmosomes) around delayed implants.	0.45777957985231066
The result of the dynamic and static histomorphometry showed no significant differences in the two groups (P < 0.1).	0.8430727969876166
In conclusion, it can be stated that a new steady-state of the soft and hard tissue around dental implants was seen 8 months after implant insertion in both groups.	0.6487594882098385
There was a pseudoankylotic healing in the osseous part.	0.49474528065567674
The lower level of osseointegration in immediate-placed implants was caused by early resorption of bone in the crestal part.	0.41030978383868216
Thus, a larger part of the implant was surrounded by soft tissue and a long epithelial attachment resulted.	0.6928367235604382
Polydactyly may be preaxial or tibial (halluxside), postaxial or ulnar (side of the little toe) and central (middle toes).	0.452708963643645

Injections with botulinum toxin type A (BTX) are considered the first-line treatment for spasmodic torticollis (ST), blepharospasm (BL) and hemifacial spasm (HFS).	0.557810414174682
Because BTX brings only temporary and partial relief, patients frequently try other additional therapies to minimize their symptoms.	0.4330058616435825
The subjective rating of all therapies ever tried by patients with ST, BL and HFS was evaluated by using a simple questionnaire.	0.5352297165553256
Two hundred questionnaires were considered (112 TS, 54 BL, 34 HFS).	0.517395412650005
BTX was rated subjectively the best therapy in all three diagnostic groups (median: 2=good effect).	0.5700539701199601
Despite Citalopram and physiotherapy (median: 3=average effect), all other therapies were rated with a median of >=4 (=minimal effect).	0.6102180605097685
Patients with ST tried 7.7, patients with BL 2.4 and patients with HFS 2.6 different types of therapy.	0.8189462920272826
In conclusion, BTX is the most effective treatment for patients with ST, BL and HFS, as rated subjectively.	0.630838737022792
Further evaluation of therapies additional to BTX injections is recommended.	0.31531707811652004
The perioperative morbidity and mortality is mainly influenced by the type and duration of surgery as well as the patient's preoperative state of health.	0.839497680328836
Anesthesia per se, however, may also result in severe perioperative (patho)physiological changes, which may be both desired (e.g.	0.5974341581659547
analgesia, vasodilation in vascular surgery) or detrimental (e.g.	0.4472662301948274
hypothermia, ventilatory depression) and which may differ depending on the anesthetic technique used (e.g.	0.49127639114559624
general anesthesia vs. regional anesthesia).	0.377607803218886
Yet, all anesthestic techniques have in common, that their effects are not limited to the duration of the surgical intervention, but may expand far into the postoperative period.	0.8875666854081553
Therefore, many trials have been performed in the past aiming to compare the impact of different anesthetic techniques on the incidence of postoperative techniques, no significant advantage of one or the other technique has been identified up to now with respect to postoperative mortality or severe morbidity.	0.8213691447126502
This finding may be due to at least three factors.	0.4916612550681196
1) Many side-effects related to anesthesia - due to close postoperative monitoring - are detected and treated early in the postoperative phase (e.g.	0.6800359362521073
in the recovery room), thereby preventing serious complications.	0.5205667518229602
2) Postoperative mortality related exclusively to anesthesia probably is so low, that huge patient numbers would be required to demonstrate any significant differences between different techniques.	0.6108229357964813
3) Besides the factor 'anesthesia', may other factors contribute to the anesthesia related morbidity and mortality (e.g.	0.5517853819933978
the factor 'anesthetist') which are hardly quantified.	0.7413207559164564
The fact that clear advantages for a single technique have not yet been demonstrated must not, however, result in anesthetic 'nihilism'.	0.4897551140292905
Rather there may be good reasons in the individual patient (e.g.	0.5664188950556569
lack of a recovery room), to prefer a certain anesthetic technique or drug over another, in order to lower the individual risk of anesthesia.	0.5955350998883594
Whether the use of a certain technique - e.g.	0.6212942907709439
spinal or epidural anesthesia - may contribute to a reduction of specific postoperative surgical complications (e.g.	0.5864993138812704
rate of reocclusion subsequent to peripheral vascular surgery) is presently under investigation.	0.5399540695235892
This paper first describes how the project study on the regulation and monitoring of medical treatment arose.	0.5766073704211796
We then introduce its objectives, the members of the study group, the composition of the collective and selection of cases, and the methods used for ascertainment and recording of data.	0.7884996111034762

M. Linehan developed "dialectical behavioral therapy" specifically to treat chronically suicidal borderline patients.	0.3559812355552156
It rests on a biosocial model that assumes a disorder in the regulation of emotions and in tolerance of stress.	0.4088036544581867
The numerous dysfunctional patterns of behavior such as self-destructive behavior, inability to govern impulses or severe dissociative phenomena are regarded as attempts at problem-solving.	0.32222930822981904
This concept of therapy focuses on the continuing balance between the necessity of accepting maladaptive behavior patterns in both an intrapsychic and an interactional context while still working to change them.	0.431573384490968
A comprehensive manual outlines the clearly structured therapy and integrates a wide choice of therapeutic strategies.	0.362688811915714
Parallel to development of the therapy itself, a method also was developed for testing therapist adherence to the manual's guidelines, thus providing a basis for empirical evaluation.	0.6630101495731809
An initial controlled, randomized study demonstrated the significant superiority of this method to methods of unspecific psychotherapy at various levels.	0.5957175873725723
In the current endeavor to develop disorder-specific approaches to the treatment of personality disorders, "dialectical behavioral therapy" is a noteworthy model.	0.7620288609122067
Complications associated with the application of a halo device are not infrequent; however, osteomyelitis of the skull with a consecutive subdural abscess is a rare but severe complication.	0.7132964102313704
We present the case of a patient with a subdural abscess as a result of a local pin-track infection of the halo device, in whom pathological behavior was the primary clinical finding.	0.8038511625362055
The possible complications associated with the halo device are discussed with emphasis on associated head injuries and preexisting neurological diseases, as well as indications for the halo, clinical symptoms of pin-track infections, necessary diagnostic measurements and the appropriate treatment.	0.716026957543877
The attempt was made to explain dysfunctions of the motor system - analogical to electronic data processing systems - as a speciality of the regulation part of the motor system.	0.6208516132285676
Thereby dysfunctions can be seen as misplaced variables in the regulation software with not defined or unknown values of afferences or combination of afferences.	0.5098807004220748
This leads to a failure of the corresponding software modul that results in the loss of function which is regulated through this modul.	0.6676474151267292
Especially with changing of afference through manual treatment or through needling, a replacement of the variables can be reached and this leads to normal function.	0.5491172862792243
With this hypothesis all phenomens of dysfunctions can be explained.	0.39109383061839204
Empirical data on costs of care for chronically mentally ill patients in Germany are rare.	0.5111879334224223
There is a lack of cross-sectional studies as well as of any analysis of the long-term course of mental health care costs.	0.7124107328931525
This study combines data from two cost-studies on patients with schizophrenia, conducted in the same catchment area at an interval of 15 years, to draw conclusions about the long-term course of these costs.	0.6641462691960685
The direct costs of comprehensive community based mental health care had increased by 77.0% during 15 years, while the costs of a permanents stay in a long-term ward of a psychiatric hospital had increased by 78.5% in the same period.	0.6910285692677932
This increase was 27 and 28.5 per cent higher than the general rise in cost of living in Germany during the interval between the two studies.	0.6607490667878465
This higher-than-average increase in mental health care costs was accompanied by a much higher cost-effectiveness.	0.5229293512124578
Thus, this rise of costs must be seen as a consequence of the great deficits and the resulting basic improvement of care for chronically mentally ill patients in Germany, which was demanded by an expert-commission of the government in the mid-seventies.	0.7381006701529342
Background: The usefulness of Holter monitoring to detect rarely occuring symptoms seems to be limited.	0.5237817727921287
In adults the event recorder has already been a precise diagnostic tool in evaluating palpitations and syncopes.	0.5049932759334783
There have been few reports of the implementation of cardiac monitoring with an event recorder in children.	0.4983417702687023
The immunomodulating effect of primary surgical intervention was investigated in 33 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx.	0.5646277463385492
An operation time longer than 7 h was significantly associated with a decrease in lymphocytes, CD4+ T-lymphocytes and CD8+ T-lymphocytes.	0.5632930022875687
The CD4/CD8-ratio as a marker for the down-regulation of the cellular immune response was slightly decreased but was still in the normal range.	0.5953073638612341
CD4-lymphocyte counts increased 7 days after operation while CD8 lymphocytes were found elevated 4 weeks after sugery.	0.45837470668456753
The in vitro stimulation of the lymphocytes was impaired for 1 to 4 weeks.	0.5948462201062731
Interleukins, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor did not show any changes after surgery.	0.5339393003959697
Decreases of lymphocytes, especially CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, were significantly associated with the time of operation and the volume of blood loss.	0.9305859310449025
Extensive trauma, age, different kinds of anesthesia and intensive care interventions were not associated with specific immunomodulating effects, although these factors might be responsible for suppressing cytokine responses.	0.608942743247788
Both preclinical and clinical evidence support the usefulness of antidepressants in chronic pain treatment.	0.5902060102820251
Monoamine uptake inhibitors influence the neurotransmissions of noradrenaline (NA) and/or serotonin (5-HT); their effect on nociception is thought to take place predominantly within the spinal cord.	0.6063715607974256
Antidepressant drugs seem to differ in their properties as analgesics and as thymoleptics.	0.4423663714960386
The present work is aimed at correlating the special mechanism of action of antidepressants in diminishing nocicepetion with the pharmacological profile of these drugs in clinical pain treatment.	0.5633187818526153
From a preclinical, experimental point of view, it can be expected, that mixed type uptake blockers should be superior to selective NA or 5-HT uptake inhibitors.	0.618522123950846
The analgesic profile of antidepressants was established by a metaanalysis of clinical trials on the effect of these drugs, given alone or in combination with other analgetics, in chronic pain syndromes.	0.8023157741804962
57 Clinical trials were separated into 5 groups according to their scientific quality: [1] placebo-controlled double-blind studies with high power; [2] placebo-controlled double-blind studies with low power; [3-4] open controlled studies or studies with historical controls; [5] case reports.	0.7335954695988436
A study was positive if the tested antidepressant was more effective than placebo or the compared drug or seemed beneficial with respect to the interval of its previous absence.	0.5260977029640439
The most effective antidepressants in chronic pain treatment only included unselective monoamine reuptake inhibitors in the following rank order: amitriptyline > clomipramine >= desipramine >= imipramine >= doxepin.	0.7040838542843292
A statement about the appropriate dosage of these drugs in chronic pain treatment, however, must wait for properly conducted dose finding studies which include the measurement of plasma concentrations.	0.6013457902093052
Intensive care medicine for both surgical and medical patients has a common scientific and clinical basis.	0.6273700309442923
In critically ill patients the medical conditions are complex and can be managed only by specialists thoroughly trained in intensive care medicine.	0.5747932524318493
Therefore, surgeons as well as anesthesiologists must have a detailed theoretical and clinical knowledge of intensive care medicine.	0.5104897011784404
Surgical training places the emphasis on operative skills, while intraoperative management of the patient by the anesthesiologist calls for skills involved in intensive care medicine.	0.617234264800404
Interdisciplinary cooperation between specialists is essential to improve the quality of intensive care medicine further.	0.6916647314064679
The cooperation that already exists between surgeons and anesthesiologists makes closer collaboration in the future a logical step.	0.46384729757470283
In this review article data of retrospective studies on the therapeutic effects of oxygen are summarized and possible indications for this therapy suggested.	0.7189068778936979
Studies in infants with chronic lung disease (CLD) showed that (i) if SaO2 was kept >= 93 % via generous prescription of home oxygen, rates of sudden death were much lower than in studies where this was less generously prescribed, (ii) weight gain was significantly better with O2 therapy than without it, (iii) increasing SaO2 from 82 to 93 % by providing low-flow oxygen resulted in a 50 % reduction of pulmonary artery pressure, (iv) hypoxia could cause a significant increase in airway resistance, and (v) low-flow oxygen reduced the frequency of intermittent falls in SaO2 to < 85 % even in infants who had values of >= 90 % at rest.	0.7743906606817703
These data suggest that oxygen therapy should be considered in CLD infants if baseline SaO2 is < 93 %.	0.6116608534438756
For older infants, particularly with CF, only few data are available.	0.7641781866202323
In these patients oxygen may only be given if SaO2 is < 90 % unless there are clinical symptoms related to hypoxaemia, e. g. pulmonary hypertension.	0.6243001101603785
Regarding the practical aspects of home oxygen therapy, provision of liquid oxygen via nasal cannulae appears to be the method of choice.	0.5937607351734939
Side effects include the risk of CO2 retention, which occurs occasionally in children with CF or sleep-related upper airway obstruction, but has not been reported for infants with CLD.	0.7549317580772674
To identify this potential side effect and to determine the exact amount of oxygen required, performance of a sleep recording of SaO2 and CO2 with and without oxygen is suggested.	0.5012881230839445
In infants with CLD, home monitoring of oxygenation should also be considered.	0.6012554392995298
Fractures of the distal radius represent one of the most common fractures and do have high social-economic relevance.	0.7463181056076639
For treatement they need practicable classification and therapeutic standards.	0.27853497056339704
The demand for stable osteosynthesis of A3-, B2-B3 and C1-C2-fractures is connected to dorsal or volar internal fixation with plate and practical autogenous cancellous bone grafting, even for the elder patient.	0.4818435811813089
The isolated external fixation with K-wires represent special situation.	0.4317808198048379
Supply of implants and biodegradable materials will support this development.	0.30377111161314957
Introduction: Pheochromocytoma during pregnancy is rare and represents a high risk for mother and fetus.	0.6336650985461156
Due to the variable clinical presentation it may be mistaken for preeclampsia.	0.5491504734827063
Case: A 34-year-old primiapara with hypertension up to 240/120 mmHg.	0.4475486728446995
After diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma its resection together with lymph node metastasis in the 17th week of gestation was performed.	0.5729912839615836
Conclusion: The definitive diagnosis is confirmed by elevation of serum catecholamines and their metabolites in a 24-h urine collection.	0.6030729165066685
Localization during pregnancy can be made by ultrasound and MRI.	0.6769490844617653
The definitive treatment is surgical removal after administration of adrenergic blockers.	0.4022726472067881
If discovered later in pregnancy, delivery by elective caesarean section followed by tumor resection is recommended.	0.3547617606224585
Since about 10 % of pheochromocytomas are malignant, postpartum screening is required to detect and treat extraadrenal or metastatic tumors by MIBG scintigraphy, chemotherapy or surgical procedures.	0.6050219902832694
Ionizing radiation from natural or man-made sources may affect human health.	0.29084155168159065
The main consequence of low and moderate radiation doses is the induction of cancer.	0.4249474296479195
To quantify these effects both epidemiological studies and experimental radiobiological research are needed.	0.3370420857977238
The ensuing results of the studies are used to establish radiation protection principles and dose limits to protect the public from the effects of ionizing radiation.	0.6053435872766294
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with premature atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular death if untreated.	0.36109712195731375
In an asymptomatic 13-year-old girl we discovered an extensive hypoplasia of the abdominal aorta and the Aa.	0.631270244520306
iliacae, a combination which so far has not been described, that has not been reported before.	0.8540325367957302
The vascular hypoplasia was asymptomatic.	0.2299747121473553
Angiography additionally showed severe atherosclerosis of the Aa.	0.2596087977054143
After 13 months of low-density-lipoprotein(LDL)-apheresis angiographically there was no pregression, but even slight improvement of vascular the disease.	0.688940847802985
Discussion: Since severe atheromatous changes of systemic arteries may be missed by clinical examination, we strongly recommend complete imaging of all major systemic arteries in children with homozygous familial hypercholesterinemia.	0.5870620612945593
LDL-apheresis is the treatment of choice in these patients.	0.6546613555537687
Since 1993 almost 400 patients with port wine stains have been treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser.	0.4985350097413315
The therapeutic effect on 61 adult patients was evaluated.	0.49536814826345826
After a mean of 2.16 treatments the colour lightened by between 33% and 100% in 70% of these patients.	0.98684449164796
The best results were obtained in patients with plain pink port wine stains.	0.650542398983844
In this kind of port wine stains the argon laser has proved to be far less successful.	0.41331992002613704
The rate of adverse effects amounted to only 5%.	0.5453756419686565
The results are expected to be improved by further laser sessions.	0.8129954782308745
The flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser is an important advance in the treatment of port wine stains.	0.4476505423015976
Most craniofacial malformations result from a premature fusion of skull sutures.	0.39216822807938384
Depending on the scope of the sutures affected, the results are more or less distinct deformations of the facial and cranial skull with substantial negative effects on functional as well as esthetic aspects.	0.6677191772657284
The etiopathology is still unclear.	0.22336130637527649
Various therapies have been developed over the past 100 years.	0.6045916485261947
However, Tessier's technique of fronto-orbital advancement has been an important milestone in the treatment of these malformations.	0.6174835764684686
Numerous adjustments have since perfected this operational technique.	0.17706232871990216
It is now possible to treat practically all skull malformations with the surgical techniques available today.	0.5198392309302047
At the same time, these techniques have also aided the advancements in tumor surgery and traumatology.	0.6101356794721466
Injuries of the flexor tendon are usually open injuries.	0.48201939516052955
In most cases primary treatment is therefore seldom performed by orthopaedic surgeons.	0.4524813819925996
This is different for injuries of the extensor tendon.	0.35235706863904875
Three quarters of injuries of the extensor tendon are closed injuries.	0.40502879883794485
Therefore we do go into primary and secondary reconstruction of the flexor tendon, but focus on primary and secondary reconstruction of the extensor tendon in the most common zones (1, Th I, 3, Th III).	0.7716437790620243
The Shouldice operation has evolved to become the classic procedure for open pure tissue repair for inguinal hernias.	0.4176188557517939
The operation is an important part of a surgeon's repertoire as he may need to perform the procedure at some critical time, especially when faced with strangulation, when tension-free prosthetic repairs and laparoscopic approaches fail.	0.6647377866333637
When properly done, the Shouldice repair yields results that have set standards for all other techniques to emulate.	0.4932462172244527
Other particular advantages of the technique are: safety, the use of local anaesthesia, benign postoperative complications and the cost, which is the most reasonable of all surgical techniques.	0.8704662150996287
Acute occlusive mesenteric ischemia is caused by a local impairment of splanchnic blood flow and poses a particular surgical challenge.	0.5261560708092072
Acute superior mesenteric occlusion is a medical/surgical emergency mandating prompt diagnosis (clinical awareness, angiography) and therapy (exploratory laparotomy with possible arterial reconstruction; embolectomy, thrombectomy; and/or bowel resection).	0.5366185392828645
The difficulty of early diagnosis is probably the most important cause of the high mortality which varies from 70 % to 90 % in arterial and functional mesenteric ischemia and from 20 % to 70 % in an acute thrombosis of the mesenteric veins.	0.9792511346397585
Improved survival from nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is dependent upon the identification of high-risk groups and on aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures (intra-arterial infusion of papaverine through the angiographic catheter with or without bowel resection).	0.60860261769868
For assessment of bowel viability, the clinical judgement during first- or second-look exploration is still the most reliable parameter.	0.8227161726482767
The surgical management of chronic mesenteric ischemia includes aortomesenteric grafting and transaortic endarterectomy in the majority of patients with comorbidity of cardiovascular arteriosclerotic diseases and results in a high rate of symptom-free patients.	0.6450196514289039
Prophylactic reconstruction of visceral arteries is indicated only in certain limited circumstances.	0.41097911341159354
Thirty-nine of 63 patients undergoing deep anterior rectal resection received a straight coloanal anastomosis (CAA); the remaining 24 patients additionally had a colon-j-pouch (CPA) constructed.	0.47395574065333324
After pouch-anal anastomosis, local septic complications occurred in 12.5 % of patients compared to 20.5 % after coloanal anastomosis.	0.7897577013116233
Stool frequency after pouch-anal anastomosis was 3.3 per 24 h compared to 5.2 per 24 h after straight anastomosis within the first year after ileostomy closure (P = 0.053).	0.6866376541313807
Continence was slightly better in the pouch group (n. s.), and anal manometry showed a significant postoperative decrease only in resting pressure after straight coloanal anastomosis (P < 0.001).	0.6148742527643146
This study supports the construction of a colon-j-pouch after deep rectal resection, as the pouch-anal anastomosis has fewer local septic complications and seems to improve functional outcome.	0.6146744225448484
The introduction of flow-directed pulmonary artery (PA) catheters has helped to improve our knowledge of cardiovascular physiology.	0.48827000645484303
There have been several developments of this equipment in recent years, including continuous monitoring of mixed-venous O2 saturation (Sv\=O2) and cardiac output (CO).	0.5891929109184856
The high purchase price, however, is an obstacle to its use in the critically ill.	0.7017526396382723
The aim of the present study was to analyse the actual costs of these devices in comparison to standardly used intermittent monitoring of Sv\=O2 and CO.	0.5692354607028444
Purpose: Persistent hypotony with maculo-pathy is a severe complication of mitomycin C when used during filtration surgery.	0.4143801228446949
We wanted to know whether this complication can be controlled by a surgical reintervention yielding tight closure of the initial sclerostomy.	0.5937687493945738
The detection of cytokines may elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms that produce early systemic complications in acute interstitial (i) or necrotizing (n) pancreatitis (AP).	0.5958379133571962
The increase in the level of cytokines in the blood of patients with AP may correlate with the severity of the disease.	0.8551777512738681
In a prospective clinical trial from October 1992 to August 1993, 23 patients with AP were recruited and blood samples taken for cytokine detection by commercially available Elisa kits and C-reactive protein (CRP) by laser nephelometry.	0.5753382530481178
Six of 11 patients with nAP died either early (n = 1) or of late septic complications.	0.5890113208152136
The peak of cytokine and CRP level in the first 3 days of hospitalization was used for calculation.	0.7910360004468431
The IL-6 concentration in the blood reached up to 2600 pg/ml in the 1st few days, depending on the severity of AP, and dropped to almost zero in the next days, independently of the clinical course.	0.646932292016433
The differentiation of i- versus nAP, using a cutoff line of 600 pg/ml, was correct in 20 patients [87 %, sensitivity (SE): 82 %, specificity (SP): 91 %, P < 0.001].	0.7144327448855052
The blood levels of IL-8 reached a maximum of 1381 pg/ml in the 1st few days, depending on the severity of AP, and showed a correlation with the clinical course in the following days.	0.7203306678558097
The peak of IL-8 blood levels indicated correctly the severity of AP in 18 out of 23 patients using a cutoff level of 200 pg/ml (accuracy: 78 %, SE: 82 %, SP: 75 %, P < 0.01).	0.5700277478104083
The CRP levels increased up to a maximum of 535 mg/l and indicated the course of AP correctly in 18 out of 22 patients (SE and SP 82 %, P < 0.01).	0.5485510122472594
There was no correlation between cytokine blood levels and mortality.	0.5260729358822321
In the blood samples of five patients with i- or nAP, no TNF- was detectable.	0.8808721095676281
The blood levels of IL-6, and to a lesser extent of IL-8 and CRP, can predict the severity and early systemic complications of AP.	0.8267976549768501
The excessive rise in cytokines can be explained by the stimulation of immunological cells (macrophages, lymphocytes and endothelial cells) in the course of AP, inducing early systemic complications.	0.5730517792681841
The surface area and the microporosity of bone regeneration materials influence their chemical and biological properties.	0.41570812093648046
Therefore, the size of the specific surface area and the distribution of the pore diameters (pores < 1 µm) of bone regeneration materials were analyzed within this study.	0.6957524522204476
The analyzed hydroxyapatites were of synthetic, bovine, and phytotroph origin.	0.4786583036156746
The tricalcium phosphates and the bioglasses included only synthetic materials.	0.2237411221366833
The gas adsorption of each specimen was analyzed using a volumetric N2/Kr system (ASAP 2010, Micromeritics).	0.34031626630501444
Additionally, for materials with a specific surface area (> 2 m2/g) the pore size distribution was evaluated by the BJH-method.	0.8057719743888377
Two of the materials evaluated astonishingly large dimensions of the specific surface area (BioOss 79.7 m2/g, Algipore new 14.6 m2/g).	0.4619981268522549
A medium surface area was found for Algipore old (4.9 m2/g) and Interpore200 (2.64 m2/g).	0.8045310242066875
All other included materials showed only small sizes of the specific surface area (Ceros80 1.8 m2/g, Ceros82 1.31 m2/g, Cerasorb 1.2 m2/g, Biobase 0.7 m2/g, Endobone 0.7 m2/g, Perioglas 0.6 m2/g, Allotropat50 0.23 m2/g, Biogran 0.2 m2/g).	0.520919348061038
The materials with large and medium sizes of the specific surface area evaluated the following pore diameters: BioOss 2-50 nm, Algipore new 2-100 nm, Algipore old 5-50 nm, Interpore200 2-100 nm.	0.4692508998236045
Pore sizes less than 2 nm were not found in relevant numbers.	0.5137951075374694
The materials BioOss, old and new Algipore, and Interpore200 contain a large interconnecting mesopore system (diameter < 1 µm).	0.5644785957485338
For the materials Biobase, Endobone, Perioglas, Allotropat 50, and Biogran this cannot be assumed.	0.48490789213041163
The materials Ceros80, Ceros82, and Cerasorb evaluated a specific surface area between those and might include only a small part of these interconnecting pores.	0.5426453302530312
An influence of the interconnecting porosity and the different sizes of the specific surface areas on the biological behavior of the bone regeneration materials can be suggested.	0.6805213983518605
The literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from 1950 to 1995 was reviewed in four parts.	0.3480447957724949
In the present Part 4 ten possibly useful targets for future research are formulated:...	0.5830270378473625
Radiotherapy unequivocally has to be regarded as standard therapy in stage I and IIA/B testicular seminoma.	0.5598717938698989
Using low dose abdominal irradiation tumour control rates of 95-98 % in stage I disease and 80-95 % in stage IIA/B can be achieved.	0.7679390699505351
Disease specific survival reaches 100 %.	0.31456430167545535
Likewise, radiotherapy is treatment of first choice in case of testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN) in a solitary testis or in case of a double-sided TIN yielding safe eradication of the in-situ carcinoma of the testis.	0.6987670553538318
Objectives of further clinical research in radiotherapy of testicular malignancies aim at reduction of treatment intensity in order to minimize acute and late side effects of irradiation without compromising tumour control rates.	0.5425792904963735
A forty year old healthy adult man was admitted to our out-patient department because of a highly elevanted rheumatoid factor.	0.5755754266848975
Since the person was planning an extended stay in Africa, we performed an extensive history, clinical and laboratory examination to rule out oligosymptomatic inflammatory diseases.	0.7069938675464157
We further analyzed if the person presented genetic risk factors to develop rheumatic diseases in the future or if the presence of the rheumatoid factor could be a reaction to multiple immunizations.	0.6312677861849234
Possible explanations for an elevated rheumatoid factor including the genetic risk factors are discussed.	0.5141272954337669
A multifactorial etiology underlies the  majority of cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD).	0.4574792581897479
Both ill-defined environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of the disease.	0.5127825295982762
Allele 4 of ApoE is a genetic risk factor.	0.368005970056165
Its presence increases the risk of developing AD.	0.5763636341743886
However, presence of e4 is neither necessary nor sufficient for the disease to arise.	0.538810560357302
Apart from the common multifactorial forms of the disease, there are rare variants which are inherited as Mendelian traits.	0.6114730594425907
To date three genes are known that can be  mutated in these rare forms of AD.	0.4573619570054188
Of these, mutations in the gene presenilin 1 on chromosome 14 are most frequent.	0.47310952857923555
In addition, mutations in the gene presenilin 2 on chromosome 1 and in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP on chromosome 21) occur in autosomal dominant AD.	0.5127441072468791
This article reviews our present knowledge of the genetics of AD and discusses its relevance for patients with AD and their relatives.	0.6439385229656829
In recent years female psychoanalysts provided fertile approaches to an understanding of the mother-daughter-relationship with the conceptions of the 'lesbian complex' (Poluda-Korte), the 'symbiotic illusion' (Halberstadt-Freud), the 'higher permeability of the ego-boundaries' (Rohde-Dachser), and the 'conflict of separation-individuation which has to be resolved again and again throughout life' (Berger).	0.5395177920044968
In the light of these conceptions it is hypothesized that in analyses with both participants being of equal gender (female-female psychoanalyses) a specific intensity and quality of female aggression may manifest itself when certain threshold situations of the pre-oedipal mother-daughter-relationship are revided.	0.4462678270193846
Case vignettes and a literary example illustrate the risks as well as possible resolutions engendered by these early relationship dynamics, as these are reactivated in the here and now of the analyst's relationship towards her patient.	0.5013331481239431
There has been a marked increase in the incidence of pelvic fractures over the last few years.	0.6913030093553415
Associated injuries to the urogenital and vascular system as well as nerve injuries worsen the prognosis.	0.47120204140033717
Over a five year period 126 patients with severe pelvic trauma were treated.	0.5471656351211583
Out of these 39 (30.9%) sustained additional peripelvic injuries and represent the study sample.	0.6461120439977875
Type B injuries according to the AO classification occurred in 16 (41%) patients, type C fractures in 23 (59%) patients.	0.7995812845181566
The spleen, liver and kidney were the most frequently injured organs (58.9%), followed by urogenital lesions (46.6%), nerve injuries (25.6%) and vascular lesions (15.3%).	0.7019384675110719
The most common extrapelvic lesions were thoracic injuries in 56.4% and severe head injuries (GCS<8) in 33.3%.	0.7726392432965019
The mean Hannover Polytraumascore was 35.6 points, the mean Injury Severity Score 27.6 points.	0.7801251356938643
Osteosnthesis was performed in 21 pelvic ring fractures (53%), eight procedures (50%) in type B fractures and 13 (56%) in type C fractures.	0.8509200758384972
In type B injuries the anterior pelvic ring was stabilized with a tension band wiring in four cases, in two patients with an external fixator and with plate osteosynthesis in one case.	0.8751645580370331
In type C injuries the external fixator was applied as the only stabilizing procedure in six patients.	0.6627507968006955
In four cases the anterior ring was fixed with tension band wiring or plates and the dorsal aspect of the pelvic ring with sacral bars.	0.5900048627925456
Three patients had their additional acetabular fracture plated through a anterior approach.	0.41386608990706836
All surviving 28 patients were followed up for an average of 18 months (range 7--59 months) after the trauma.	0.8845067148585505
The patients were classified using the pelvic outcome score proposed by the German Society of Trauma Surgery.	0.6995251096976359
53.4% of the type B fractures showed a good clinical outcome, 47.6% a poor outcome.	0.8468450102934144
15.4% with type C fractures presented with a good outcome, 84.6% with a poor outcome.	0.8821998699347554

Urinary bladder ruptures are treated as an emergency, urethral lesions electively after four to six weeks .We recommend external fixation of the pelvis in the acute phase for control of both the osseous instability and control of haemorrhage through external compression.	0.7103148113609177
The treatment of choice for the anterior pelvic ring is tension band wiring or plating.	0.6442087917413608
If this is contraindicated due to an open fracture external fixation is the treatment of choice.	0.6958306168834908
Type C fractures require posterior ring stabilization which should be postponed until four days post admission.	0.38731007482015894
Dysfunction of serotonergic neurotransmission has been associated with two different psychopathological syndromes - impulsive aggressivity resulting form a lack of stimulation of the "behavior inhibition system" on the one hand and the manifestation of clinical depression and compulsive syndromes on the other.	0.58291106518342
The examination of primate behavior provides a model which may reconciliate these seemingly contradictory hypotheses.	0.4139839512100926
According to primate experiments, monoaminergic depletion results in anxious and desperate behavior only if the individual has previously been exposed to social isolation stress, which in turn induces a decrease in the central serotonin turnover rate.	0.5598007104168446
Young non-human primates who experience early social separation stress are anxious and fearful, while as adults they tend to be aggressive, consume excessive amounts of alcohol and are less intoxicated by alcohol intake.	0.4495142155137041
These observation indicate the importance of social separation stress in the pathogenesis of alcoholism and antisocial behavior and may point to prophylactic and pharmacological treatment strategies.	0.44381813182831353
The implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses (PCL) leads to greater trauma to the eye than endocapsular PCL implantation.	0.3866438280012807
Persistent breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier might impair the postoperative long-term prognosis.	0.5350459643104741
Using laser-tyndallometry, we quantified the disorder of the barrier function during the early postoperative phase and in the long-term postoperative course for both surgical procedures.	0.7575074434212447
During the first 3 postoperative days, flare values were three times higher in the group with transsclerally sutured PCL than in the conventional PCL group.	0.804068186464928
Cell counts after transscleral suture fixation (27.7 +/- 18.3/0.075 mm3) decreased slightly during the first 5 postoperative days.	0.6139114639290933
In contrast, the conventional PCL group regained the preoperative level (2.5 +/- 5.1) after 3 days.	0.8550555929646425
After 3 months, no significant differences in flare values and cell counts were seen between the two groups.	0.7023189462071806
After implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses, breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier was initially more pronounced than in conventional PCL implantation.	0.49267288361737294
However, the barrier function was re-established equally in both groups in the long term.	0.7080669346294467

Tracheostomy is considered the airway management of choice in long-term ventilated ICU patients.	0.6759524455175212
In the last few years, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) has been established as an attractive and safe alternative to conventional open tracheostomy.	0.7738636680936912
Recently, there is another percutaneous technique according to Fantoni with translaryngeal airway access (TLT) available.	0.44020422347530186
Our study seeks to evaluate TLT in terms of complications and practicability.	0.44147483635716017
In 47 patients of our surgical ICU, elective TLT was performed.	0.46397017334570123
Mean operative time was 9.8 +/- 10.9 (range 6-27) minutes.	0.7889196664447575
Severe complications, such as bleeding, aspiration or infection of the tracheostoma have never been noted.	0.48812557234113096
A slight detoriation of arterial oxygen tension occured in 25 patients intraoperatively, demanding to rise the concentration of inspired oxygen temporarily.	0.4411738891067702
However, no patient became hypoxic during the procedure.Since during the procedure gas exchange may worsen, TLT should not be employed in patients whose inspired oxygen concentration exceeds 80%.	0.6496511062973702
Despite the fact that severe complications associated with TLT have recently not yet been reported, physicians who perform TLT should be well-trained in the technique of conventional open tracheostomy, too.	0.5838283604825215
According to our present data, TLT seems to be an attractive and safe alternative to PDT.	0.7192275289422443
Nevertheless, for a definiteve evaluation of TLT, further investigations in larger groups of patients and in the long term seem to be necessary.	0.9559555028273409
There are no direct associations between testosterone levels and sexual function in the aging male.	0.6069374610082543
A study of 169 patients focusing on the relations of hormone levels and sexual dysfunction did not reveal associations between testosterone levels and the risk of altered sexual functions.	0.5598849737608897
In volunteers, in whom a hypogonadism was generated by the application of GnRH, no alteration in sexual reactions occurred.	0.6836486236894618
It is possible that other testosterone fractions are more meaningful than the total testosterone.	0.5590999894682248
However, all the known fractions correlate closely.	0.6723645769672117
The significance of a normal testosterone level for a normal erection has been rarely considered up to now.	0.6506098798636106
In an animal experiment, the intracavernous pressure, the density of -receptors, and the PDES activity depended on normal testosterone levels.	0.7832913436918931

In a 65 years old male patient 38 cc of a 7.45% potassium chloride-solution was inadvertently infused within 3 hours into an epidural catheter on the first postoperative day.	0.6189717317376636
The epidural potassium chloride administration resulted in a paresis and painful paraesthesia of the patient's legs and a level of sensory blockade to TH 11.	0.5368677449622837
Furthermore vegetative symptoms like hypertension and tachycardia were observed.	0.22401094639067284
For therapy a single bolus of 40 mg dexamethasone was administered intravenously followed by an epidural infusion of sodiumchloride 0,9% 99 cc/h for several hours.	0.4949568207657189
About 6 hours after the start of infusion all symptoms had disappeared.	0.3629490312478905
It is proposed that the use of colour-coded epidural catheter devices and coloured electrolyte solutions as well as infusion-pumps with a larger reservoir that reduce the frequency of syringe changes would be helpful in avoiding such complications.	0.4847509894791992
This paper reviews respiratory muscle/circulation interaction in congestive heart failure.	0.4288207950851691
Respiratory muscle dysfunction consisting of both reduced pressure - generating capacity and reduced endurance is well documented in these patients.	0.49613795271259237
The mechanisms underlying its development and the potential consequences especially in the development of dyspnea are then presented.	0.5524218007688272
Not only are respiratory muscles dysfunctioning in these patients, but under specific circumstances they can impede the circulation, such as during weaning from mechanical ventilation.	0.47241938866883293
The underlying pathophysiology and the theoretical model explaining this interesting interaction is finally discussed.	0.37009387930762083
Traumatic, perilunate dislocations are rare lesions, and one third of them are associated with perilunate dislocation fractures.	0.6982755060344605
Unfortunately, one quarter of all such fractures go unrecognized, although conventional X-rays can allow their diagnosis in as many as 48% of cases, which can be improved by performing CT or bone scan in addition to 62% and 95%, repectively.	0.7572075330919673

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon- (IFN-) were both administered subcutaneously (SC) in combination with intravenously (IV) applied 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for the treatment of patients with metastasized renal cell carcinoma (RCC).	0.78009757522548
The therapy protocol consisted of a treatment cycle of 8 weeks, which could be carried out in an outpatient regimen.	0.701653002641364
The IFN- was given in each of the 8 weeks (6-9 MU/m2 once to three times weekly SC) combined sequentially with IL-2 (5-20 MU/m2 three times weekly SC for 4 weeks) and 5-FU (750 mg/m2 IV weekly for 4 weeks).	0.8220364639280754
Among the 30 consecutive patients treated, in 2 cases a complete, and in 9 cases a partial, remission was achieved in patients with mostly lung and skeletal metastases, with an overall objective response rate of 37 %.	0.783040581826857
Mean response duration was 8 months (range 3-18 months).	0.6161456288092317
A stable state of the disease lasting 3-18 months was observed in 10 cases.	0.8973339414483353
The side effects were only slight and corresponded to toxicity grade I (n = 2), grade II (n = 22) and grade III (n = 6), according to the WHO classification.	0.6403371645261587
In conclusion, this triple-drug biochemotherapy demonstrated significant clinical effectiveness comparable with that of an aggressive IL-2 treatment regimen (applied IV), but without its high toxicity.	0.634606202804845
Compression therapy was employed for 4 weeks 20 patients with chronic venous insufficiency stage CVI I and CVI II according to Widmer's classification.	0.6351502626808244
Compression bandaging for 2 weeks was followed by compression stockings for 2 more weeks.	0.3638310995151797
The cutaneous microcirculation was evaluated before therapy, after 2 weeks and after finishing compression therapy after 4 weeks.	0.5965959508502122
Marked improvement in symptoms such as pain and itching was observed after 4 weeks, along with a significant reduction in lower limb volume.	0.5536974166211779
Video capillary microscopy revealed an increase in capillary density associated with a decrease in capillary diameter and pericapillary halo diameter.	0.46644157243716367
Compression treatment achieves at least part of its effect by improving the function of the skin microcirculation.	0.597658500281237
The efficacy of bandaging and stockings was similar.	0.2724441674086175
The splanchnic perfusion is reduced early in the course of any shock.	0.36445180857908094
The mucosa of the gut suffers most as it experiences a high oxygen demand even in the steady state.	0.4844566051022844
The specific arrangement of the micro vessels within the villus of the mucosa exposes the tip of the villus at the highest risk for ischemia, particularly in low flow states.	0.5712623547877371
As a consequence the integrity of the mucosal layer is compromised and dysfunction of the mucosal barrier may allow bacteria and toxins to translocate from the gut lumen.	0.5691526272737257
Activation of leukocytes and stimulation of cytokine synthesis may comprise a sustained inflammatory response syndrome.	0.38817967596715425
So far there is a good body of evidence that the splanchnic region may play an important role in the pathophysiological sequence from shock to organ dysfunction.	0.638348169618441
As pacing impedance is inversely related to pacing current, the increase of pacing impedance additionally decreases pacing current.	0.4655796101113133
Whether the impedance measurement at implantation predicts the outcome during follow-up, was studied in 87 patients who received the VDD-single lead UniPass 425 connected to the pacemaker Unity (Sulzer Intermedics).	0.5071698941772064
The impedance changes between implantation and 6 months follow-up were assessed for each patient.	0.6313674790481523
Similar impedance values were defined, if the two measurements were within a range <= -100 to +100 .	0.7617311437473926
Six-months impedance was lower or higher compared to implantation, if the difference exceeded > -100 or > +100 .	0.7311113505274432
At implantation, impedance was 535  +/-  98  (range: 333-811 ) and significantly increased to 604  +/-  160  (range: 361-1150 ) after 6 months.	0.7459427354941685
Mean difference between the two measurements was 69  +/-  162  (range: -336 bis +560 ).	0.8118513800255978
Similar impedance had 43 (implantation: 527  +/-  75 , 6 months: 531  +/-  87 ), lower values 11 (implantation: 660  +/-  83 , 6 months: 494  +/-  73 ) and higher values 33 patients (implantation: 503  +/-  99 , 6 months: 735  +/-  168 ).	0.6520236569138244
Compared to the patients with similar impedance patients with lower impedance had a significantly higher impedance values at implantation.	0.7259507985040565

Endothelin has both vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties and might, therefore, play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes and coronary atherosclerosis.	0.4615123884838189
The aim of the study was to characterize the mechanisms and kinetics of cardiac endothelin-1 (ET-1) release following a local endothelial injury during PTCA (group A) and after sustained myocardial ischemia (group B).	0.7551873883786794
Additionally, the precision of agreement between measurements in coronary sinus and peripheral venous samples should be analyzed.	0.5008343157434834
Since first described in the early 1990s, coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has evolved as a promising noninvasive modality for imaging of the coronary arteries and evaluation of coronary artery disease.	0.8332170138102026

A digitised three-dimensional (3-D) image of the face has many valuable uses.	0.7496573835641956
These include accurate measurements of facial morphology, clinical documentation and objective analyses of surgical procedures.	0.5618801876122644
A new system presented here, based on stereophotogrammetric techniques, instantaneously captures digitised images using high-resolution cameras.	0.4802797418393945
It has an accuracy of more than 0.5 mm RMS and creates the 3-D image from approximately 20,000 points.	0.6475000179667602
The principles of the image capturing are demonstrated and the potential uses discussed.	0.5899191782832001
Surgical changes of the soft tissue in two patients following orthognathic surgery are also illustrated.	0.701287667185709

A potential impact of tricyclic antidepressants on oral anticoagulation is controversial.	0.30423816688869804
Phenprocoumon - the most commonly used anticoagulant in Germany - is rarely considered in clinical trials.	0.950563244355109
In the present study, a potential drug-drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclics, causing an alteration in prothrombinemic effects, has been investigated.	0.646040721353828
To analyse the possible injuries of vertebral segments, especially the disc, after unstable thoracolumbar fractures stabilised with AO internal fixator, we performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the traumatised region after implant removal.	0.6952011229564102
There were two aspects of disc degeneration (DD): (1) biochemical changes and (2) structural damage.	0.6025169202269575
MRI detects biochemical processes as one aspect of DD that is often small even in the presence of greater structural damage of the nucleus pulposus caused by fracture.	0.46750644056755225
None of the patients presented with structural failure of the anulus fibrosus, which is the essential structural component of the vertebral segments with regard to stability.	0.8555588575131599
We observed biochemical changes more often in the lower of the two fracture-adjacent discs and alterations of discal shape more often in the upper of the two, whereas loss of height concerned both discs to approximately the same degree.	0.7583708226365342
The supporters of upper-disc resection in thoracolumbar fractures justify their procedure among other things with the structural disc damage, such as alteration of shape and loss of height (altogether more frequent in the upper disc).	0.5076456461304122
Our observations that a disc with a structurally altered nucleus pulposus can be biochemically intact and can show an intact anulus fibrosus are arguments in favour of disc preservation.	0.388019399735754
With regard to the upper disc, the widespread opinion that complete and regular disc damage requires a resection has to be revised.	0.6714504687159851
The question of whether the lower disc should be resected more often because of its greater biochemical changes cannot be answered by the present study alone.	0.6998948807037997
Besides the excellent static information in all anatomical structures of the vertebral column available by MRI, a repeat examination in a prone position yields dynamic information on the spinal cord in the case of suspected dorsal adhesions.	0.6316925353683899
To study the frequency and clinical aspects of cold urticaria in Central Europe, patient data from a university dermatology clinic and a private dermatology office between 1984-94 were analysed and the patients reexamined if possible.	0.5985971415901826
The incidence of cold urticaria was found to be 0.05%.	0.6377489684350145
Of the 56 patients with cold urticaria (31 women, 25 men), 49 had idiopathic cold urticaria.	0.6010141017846788
The mean age was 41.0 +/- 15.6 year, the mean duration of disease 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.	0.8493525469780668
Atopy was found in 46.5% of patients, and 23.2% of the patients suffered from other types of urticaria (cholinergic, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and heat-induced).	0.7230350269011261
Laboratory examinations were only rarely abnormal.	0.3207332061489856
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with generally only moderate symptomatic improvement.	0.6589393768886307
Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin, 1-2 mil IU/d over 2-4 weeks, n=18, or tetracyclines, 2 g/d over 2 weeks, n=10) induced full remission in 13 patients and symptomatic improvement in 8.	0.6381812345030422
During an average of 6.5 year-follow-up, 20 of 43 symptomatic patients went into spontaneous remission.	0.6519014477288729
The good therapeutic response to antibiotics in this study underlines the need for a better elucidation of the cause of cold urticaria, in view of possible infectious causes.	0.7372296771852715

A 37-year-old woman had intensive care for 105 days and artificial ventilation for 72 days because of a lung transplantation and multiple postoperative complications.	0.5542920997247482
She developed severe heterotopic ossification of both shoulders, the right elbow and both hip joints.	0.5880615323688948
Owing to complete joint stiffness, she was immobilized and unable to eat or drink without help.	0.3752756672446032
Operative treatment was performed in two procedures.	0.6918633632523062
The right shoulder and right elbow were operated on first; the right hip and later the left hip were operated on after recovery from the previous surgical procedures.	0.6201969458909629
After 22 months, there was a good functional result; the patient took part in all activities of daily life and was pain-free.	0.8129645508319117

Background: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is one of the most common forms of supraventricular tachycardia in the pediatric population.	0.6375318336741927
Patients and methods: 41 children with a mean age of 9.6 (3.7-16) years with recurrent atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) refractory to medical treatment (n=38) and recurrent syncope (n=3) underwent electrophysiologic (EP) study.	0.7434110655959935
In all patients dual AV-nodal physiology could be demonstrated during EP study and typical form of AVNRT (mean heart rate 220/min) could be induced by programmed atrial stimulation.	0.6566302185905794
A steerable 7 F ablation catheter was placed at the inferoparaseptal region of the tricupid valve annulus close to the orifice of the coronary sinus with the intention to record a late fractionated local atrial electrogram during sinus rhythm.	0.5259858489224698
Starting at this point radiofrequency current (500 kHz) with a target temperature of 70 °C was delivered with the intention to ablate the slow pathway.	0.6133531750015047
If a slowly accelerated junctional rhythm (<120/min) occurred during energy discharge, programmed atrial stimulation was repeated.	0.6006088023970264
Otherwise radiofrequency current was delivered step by step up to a septal position next to the tricuspid valve annulus.	0.4342163488605599
Slow pathway ablation was defined as lack of evidence of dual AV nodal pathways during repeated atrial stimulation.	0.48085609003163393
Slow pathway modulation was defined as maximal one atrial echoimpulse after ablation.	0.36809263403252895
Results: The number of energy applications ranged from 1-19 (median 6).	0.7219643561306166
In 35/41 patients slow pathway ablation could be achieved; in six patients the slow pathway was modulated.	0.5918697313151726
In none of the patients permanent high grade AV block was observed.	0.6153332393541764
During follow-up (mean 4.1 years) two patients had a recurrent episode of AVNRT after slow pathway modulation.	0.8476099816422735
All other patients are still free of AVNRT without medical treatment.	0.5543230953014774
Conclusion: Selective radiofrequency current ablation/modulation of the slow pathway is a safe and curative treatment of AVNRT in young patients.	0.5238922625301469
Since we had the impression that there was an increase in blood loss during mammaplasties after a change in the anesthesiology department responsible, we conducted a study to compare 28 cases from each anesthesiology department.	0.7077852270377295
All operations were carried out by the first author in succession using the same operative technique.	0.6327200909238612
The two groups did not differ in age, BMI, operative time, weight of resected tissue or preoperative laboratory.	0.7476709112796708
Blood loss was calculated from the perioperative drop in hemoglobin and patient's blood volume.	0.5005446506545933
Blood pressure, heart rate, medication and intravenous fluid supply were obtained from the anesthetic protocols.	0.4894430969774163
Results (means and standard deviations): Group I (n = 28) and [Group II (n = 28)]: total resected tissue 1862  +/-  928 g [1912  +/-  791 g]; Hb-preop.	0.5917303955016142
13.6  +/-  0.9 g/dl [13.8  +/-  0.8 g/dl]; Hb-postop.	0.7365252252863468
10.8  +/-  1.3 g/dl [9.7  +/-  1.3 g/dl] P = 0.006; Blood loss 970  +/-  339 ml [1443  +/-  456 ml] P < 0.001.	0.7289699559150981
After exclusion of surgical or biological causes hemodynamic effects of the anesthetic techniques were suspected as the reason for the significant difference in blood loss.	0.6594244689774732
MAP was elevated only initially, while the heart rate was considerably elevated throughout the procedures in group II.	0.773100265562704
During anesthesia with nitrous oxide and enflurane, the dose of enflurane in group I could be limited to 0.3-0.5 % after initial i. v. administration of 60 to 100 µg sufentanil, while in group II without opioids doses of 0.5-2 % were required.	0.9235970543100175
The well-known dose-dependend effect of enflurane on the peripheral vascular tone was not masked by vasoconstrictors at the operative site.	0.4471130546166946
Conclusions: Blood loss during mammaplasties can be affected considerably by the anaesthetic technique - even without deliberate hypotension.	0.645392276929525
Sufentanil can indirectly reduce the blood loss by lowering the necessary dose of enflurane.	0.5342775272969718
Blood transfusions can be avoided at mammaplasties.	0.5456504004751253
Continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine with the opioid fentanyl represents an effective analgesic method in the therapy of strong postoperative pain after major surgery.	0.5659409183852601
Preparation of the required infusion solution in syringes with a volume of 50 ml immediately prior to administration is routinely performed by nursing staff in Germany.	0.43399761779287793
The effort required for the preparation is associated with logistical and pharmaceutical difficulties.	0.45565308256399295
The preparation of a mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.06% and fentanyl 0.0002% in 250 ml infusion bags at the pharmacy of the University Hospital Mainz is described.	0.5643302301739924
To determine the physicochemical stability, the concentration of bupivacaine-HCl and fentanyl was assessed using HPLC over a period of 32 days; in addition the pH values were determined.	0.6879304443300291
After 32 days 95% of the bupivacaine hydrochloride and fentanyl baseline values were recorded.	0.4858640850196969
The pH baseline value had decreased from 5.48-5.52 to 0.5-0.7 units.	0.756165861591326
The measured values confirm the physicochemical stability of the mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.06% and fentanyl 0.0002% over a period of 32 days.	0.46047814818652666
The infusion bag can be stored for 4 weeks at room temperature.	0.4018915532915984
The programming of a cochlear implant speech processor used by young children is often difficult, especially when the stimulus level associated with maximum auditory loudness (MAL) needs to be determined.	0.5664977730460686
Excessively high stimulation should be avoided as this can have a traumatic effect.	0.5687924523923711
The aim of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between the intraoperatively determined electrical stapedius reflex threshold (ESRT) and the postoperatively determined MAL and hearing threshold for 27 patients, each having one of three implant types.	0.6283957486099255
The question of whether the ESRT provides a practical technique to simplify, improve and accelerate speech processor programming was investigated.	0.4645436806338438
For the monopolar stimulation mode used for the Med-El and Clarion implant systems, the average MAL and threshold was expressed as a percentage of the average ESRT across all electrodes.	0.5820591864966612
For the "common ground" stimulation mode used for the Nucleus implant system, a parabolic transformation was used to relate MAL and ESRT to one another.	0.5865471965649972
These transformations between MAL values calculated from the ESRT and the actual MAL values, determined psychoacoustically, diverged considerably from one another.	0.45521103462010604
Therefore, it was not possible to determine the MAL from the ESRT with certainty.	0.8657350146938972
The ESRT does, however, provide a means to estimate an approximate upper boundary for the MAL, apart from its use to control implant function.	0.400322264472367
The determination of the exact MAL will still need to be determined using behavioural techniques.	0.5934057375685228
Movements and vibrations of intraocular structures can be observed during vitrectomy with mechanical cutting systems.	0.45716638630858325
We experimentally compared these intraocular motion artifacts between mechanical and erbium:YAG laser vitrectomy.	0.2841503712215547
Spontaneous rupture und false aneurysms of the non-arteriosclerotic aorta are rare.	0.30836906061558517
We report on a 53-year-old patient with false aneurysm due to covered rupture of the thoraco abdominal aorta following sarcoidosis initially repaired by semicircumferential aortic end-to-end anastomosis.	0.5091245554470042
After 6 months local recurrence occurred and the afflicted aorta was replaced by autologous arterial graft, transferring the right iliac artery as aortic patch.	0.4749442391250249
The iliac reconstruction was performed by PTFE interposition.	0.5771855907480657
There was no specific therapy for sarcoidosis.	0.5913896677016526
At 1 year follow-up there was no recurrence and the patient is free of symptoms.	0.9027518331031611
In this biomechanical study the implanted Unreamed Humeral Nail (UHN) has been tested concerning bending and torsional stiffnesses.	0.4832079565198381
In literature other intramedullary implants have been critisized for insufficient rotatory stability especially in transverse and short oblique fractures of the humeral shaft.	0.4237484593795469
This study examined, whether the implanted UHN, as well as the UHN implanted with interfragmentary compression through a specific compression device, is able to augment torsional stiffness significantly.	0.6060810909312891
To evaluate bending and torsional stiffnesses, the UHN has been compared biomechanically to the Russell-Taylor humeral nail (RT) in paired mid-shaft osteotomized cadaveric humeri.	0.5127585135365512
Identic paired comparison has been performed with the UHN without and UHN with interfragmentary compression.	0.47294124231145446
In anterior-posterior, as well as medio-lateral direction stiffness under four-point-bending is significantly higher in stabilizing with the RT.	0.429499641857202
Under torsional loading with moments of 4 Nm, 6 Nm and 8 Nm the UHN reached more than the double torsional stiffness.	0.4586883290147357
The RT, which is only dynamically interlocked, owns a high initial "play" between bolts and nail itself.	0.5085176858836855
Through additional interfragmentary compression stiffness of the UHN under four-point-bending in anterior-posterior, as well as medio-lateral direction augments significantly.	0.36020136810276543
Also under torsional loading with moments of 4 Nm, 6 Nm und 8 Nm torsional stiffness increases with interfragmentary compression significantly.	0.39581944677527026
In comparison to other biomechanical studies of different autorship it is clear, that this statically interlocked intramedullary nailing of the humeral shaft is superior to non-statically interlocked types of nailing concerning their stabilizing potency in torsion and serves especially for fracture types, which are critically under rotation, as transverse or short oblique humeral shaft fractures.	0.616478005155984
While the different national health systems merge structurally, cost expansion in health care is a global challenge.	0.4878046054122417
Structural reforms have been developed during recent years in the USA which can be summarized as "managed care".	0.655824790472306
They are characterized by the evolution of an economically orientated system, in which units of medical therapy are generally handled like conventional economical goods.	0.6451713776096939
In managed-care models, patients are deliberately directed to the most economic forms of therapy.	0.6541505838325545
The spectrum of medical interventions as well as diagnostic or therapeutic patterns are predefined by a system of contracted guidelines, which lead to a standardization of processes.	0.6113719800338676
Financing and medical executive responsibilities fuse.	0.218969953572789
The autonomy of medical decisions is clearly reduced to enforce an integrated and economically oriented steering of the health system.	0.4401690281691276
Leadership is no longer primarily confined to doctors or scientists.	0.44884078412459
It is progressively shifting to financing institutions, managing directors or insurance companies.	0.2684769938478864
Structural changes currently are expanding rapidly in the U. S. and have meanwhile led to marked regional reductions of medical costs.	0.43418910388541126
Nevertheless, the US model is still far more expensive compared to the German system.	0.7035952642858719
Historical development, current concepts of US-managed care, its potential influence and general applicability to the German situation are discussed in an overview.	0.6657363217612545
On the subject of natriuretic peptides there is a great deal of controversy, and intensive research efforts have been made studying their effects on electrolyte homeostasis.	0.7604881300597716
In the early 1980s, a peptide that caused diuresis, natriuresis, and had a relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle was discovered independently by several groups.	0.6780028226673076
This was the breakthrough for the identification of natriuretic peptides, followed by the characterisation of the amino-acid sequences of several species.	0.509472778766439
Synthesis of the peptide, cloning of the encoding gene, identification and characterisation of specific receptors, as well as the development of antibodies and radioimmunoassays were rapidly accomplished.	0.5313301970118602
Research on the immunohistochemistry of cardiodilatin/atrial natriuretic peptide (CDD/ANP) and the regulation of CDD/ANP gene expression led to detection of the peptide in extra-atrial tissues.	0.5939737385773199
Later on, two new peptides were discovered brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).	0.5400677602108406
These peptides share structural features with CDD/ANP with regard to their 17-amino-acid-exhibiting loop bridged by a disulfide bond.	0.40833487584246886
Another recently discovered peptide is urodilatin (URO), a renal-borne new member of A-type natriuretic peptide.	0.4793273489678735
URO was isolated from human urine and consists of the same sequence as CDD/ANP, containing the 17-amino-acid residue loop of the circulating hormone with 4 additional amino acids located at the NH2-terminus of the peptide.	0.5140428173134481
Regarding physiological actions, data strongly support a close association between URO and urinary sodium excretion.	0.40786168827613295
The application of URO in animals revealed a stronger diuresis and natriuresis with a lower influence on arterial blood pressure compared to CDD/ANP-99-126.	0.4656405837321323
These results were encouraging for the use of URO in clinical trials as a tool to prevent acute renal failure (ARF) in patients following heart transplantation and for treatment of incipient ARF in patients following liver transplantation.	0.6961671848712934
Summarising the results of these two studies, URO represents a new approach for not only prevention, but also for treatment of ARF following organ transplantation.	0.8359882312180511
This opens up new possibilities for the treatment of ARF of other origins in intensive care medicine.	0.42144595236227356

Introduction: Bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy occur twice to three times more frequently than after an open procedure.	0.5181150900269423
Four different types of lesions may be differentiated by the Siewert classification: postoperative bile fistulas (type I), late strictures (type II), tangential injuries of the bile duct (type III) and defect lesions (type IV).	0.6635144197820348
The diagnostic and therapeutic management is demonstrated in relation to our own experience and the literature.	0.8953429065819982
Methods: Eleven patients (median age 43.8  +/-  17.2) with bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy were operatively treated between November 1993 and December 1998.	0.7260272176395426
Nine patients (four type-II lesions, five type-IV lesions) were referred from another hospital; 2 defect lesions out of 410 laparoscopic cholecystectomies (0.5 %) were documented in our own patient group.	0.7192540402774564
Results: Four patients with late strictures were operatively treated with a hepaticocholedochostomy (n = 2) or hepaticojejunostomy (n = 2) after 14.3  +/-  8.4 months and were discharged from hospital after 10.6  +/-  3.8 days.	0.822121230857223
In both cases with type-IV lesion and a short defect, an end-to-end anastomosis was successful (hospital stay 11.6  +/-  1.0 days).	0.7623478299902025
However, a retrocolic Roux-Y end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy was perfomed in all cases with a larger defect (n = 5; hospital stay 14.8  +/-  2.0 days).	0.769014795154708
The two defect lesions in our own group were detected by intraoperative cholangiography and immediately treated after conversion either with hepaticocholedocho-stomy or hepaticojejunostomy (hospital stay 11.2  +/-  0.6 days).	0.6177110874186539
Conclusions: The incidence of bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy might be kept down by anatomic preparation, selective intraoperative cholangiography and early consideration of conversion to open procedure.	0.4995547363517753
The clinical course after biliary tract injury can be positively influenced only by a standard diagnostic and operative procedure and by an early transfer to a specialized center.	0.5951706111757012
In the last years the incidence of renal cell carcinoma diagnosis increased about 15-20 %.	0.7347142463439489
The main aim of this study was to analyse the reason of the increase of incidence.	0.6073621362969392
In the present autopsy series comprising 23.801 autopsies the percentage of patients who died of renal cell carcinoma is 1,77 % in Jena and 1,55 % in Königgrätz (200.000 inhabitants each).	0.7989798865836795
Over this time the incidence of renal cell carcinoma in autopsies has increased.	0.5550779576042956
With the advent of atypical antipsychotics, quality of life for patients with schizophrenia has improved significantly.	0.6542981590631277
The positive effects are based not only on the compliance-enhancing reduction of extrapyramidal side effects but also due to improved cognitive function and social integration, shorter duration, and overall reduction of hospital treatment.	0.5736547851092539
The mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction is still high and according to recently published data amounts to 17 to 42%.	0.5463467125289067
In the seventies introduction of thrombolytic therapy has led to a dramatic reduction in mortality of non-perioperative myocardial infarction.	0.5553864058812358
However, in the perioperative situation thrombolytic therapy remains to be problematic in most cases because of expected severe bleeding complications.	0.6476256852968918
In the last 4-6 years acute-PTCA has been established in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction.	0.8582644005787937
Up to date no data are available concerning the effect of acute-PTCA on mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction.	0.5629581051737393
Nevertheless it can be assumed, that acute-PTCA will lead to a considerable reduction in mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction.	0.7378839217337001
Therefore, in patients with significant perioperative myocardial infarction immediate coronary angiography and, if indicated, acute-PTCA should be performed.	0.8456391655570163
In principle, thrombolytic therapy is considered to be contraindicated in the intra- or postoperative situation.	0.6743058976208608
However, if coronary angiography and PTCA are not possible, thrombolysis might be taken into consideration, in particular if the expected bleeding complications are small in relation to the expected benefit of thrombolysis.	0.774273821719833
Since acute-PTCA has been shown to remarkably reduce mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction, this group of patients should be especially considered.	0.6760214736673734

Furthermore it allows closed sonographic monitoring of early intrauterine pregnancy and distinction between normal and abnormal development of pregnancy.	0.40711817524109717
A prediction in terms of pregnancy outcome can be made regarding pregnancy complications or specific risks like vaginal bleeding, the demonstration of intrauterine hematoma, advanced maternal age, early growth delay or fetal bradycardia.	0.5839791454917702
Because of the marked heterogeneity of patient groups and the diverse causes of obstruction, surgical therapy of the small-bowel ileus is difficult to standardize.	0.7887801957441927
A homogeneous strategy of intraoperative handling of the obstructed bowel (decompression, endoluminal splinting) as well as abdominal closure would be desirable.	0.4305715526975079
Adhesiolysis remains the most common procedure.	0.6598288896661698
Small bowel plication is still used by a minority of surgeons with the Noble's technique replaced by the Child-Phillips' technique and its modifications.	0.46173430961391526
However, as a result of the lack of controlled studies, there is no large body of evidence available to support the use of plication, long tubes or any other specific surgical intervention.	0.7239959319651977

Therefore, the appropriateness of CPR has been questioned as a matter of the outcome, the patient's preferences, and the cost.	0.9826760866760894
The objective of this article is to analyse ethical issues in prehospital resuscitation.	0.5027324509731418
Arguments: CPR is bound by moral considerations that surround the use of any medical treatment.	0.4208787084086927
According to Beauchamp and Childress, the hierarchy of justification in biomedical ethics consists of ethical theories, principles, rules, and particular judgements and actions.	0.48761180738686927
The decision to start CPR is based on the medical judgement that a person is suffering from circulatory arrest.	0.5387486781554607
The decision is justified by the moral rule that the victim of a cardiac arrest has the right to survive and to receive CPR.	0.5768081949338844
Moral rules are more specific to contexts and are based on ethical principles.	0.42337306073539527
The principle of beneficence means the provision of benefits for the promotion of welfare.	0.33566755236223556
Talking about beneficence in resuscitation means once again reporting stories of success, as many victims of pre- and in-hospital sudden death have been saved in the past.	0.7108234845658904
Nevertheless, resuscitative efforts still remain unsuccessful in the majority of cases, involving the principle of nonmaleficence.	0.5189246876620469
There is potential harm in CPR.	0.20882310851618677
Survivors may recover cardiac function, but sustain severe hypoxic brain damage, at worst surviving without awakening for months or years.	0.5025807488593718
In particular, post-traumatic CPR is associated with an extremely poor outcome, leading to the issue of futility.	0.6357197011080881
However, futility should be defined in a strict fashion, as there might be an individual chance of survival.	0.606218545267272
The principle of respect for autonomy means the right of a patient to accept or reject medical treatment, which continues in emergency conditions and after the patient has lost consciousness.	0.7511923341198424
The time frame in CPR requires medical decision-making within seconds, and CPR is usually initiated without the patient's involvement.	0.5509370303711697
If the patient's wish's can be ascertained later on, life-sustaining therapies might be withdrawn at that time.	0.5413036563640047
Terminally ill but still competent patients should be encouraged to write a no-CPR document, which does not deny patients relief from severe symptoms, but might facilitate withholding resuscitative efforts at the scene.	0.5432658411510679
The principle of justice affects priorities in the allocation of health care resources.	0.4563542508036837
The decision made for a particular patient might delay or prevent emergency treatment in other patients who could receive greater benefit.	0.5258046999725158
Conclusions: The standard of care remains the prompt initiation of CPR.	0.6659198375808979
However, ethical principles such as beneficene, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice have to be applied in the unique setting of emergency medicine.	0.6656276087852255
Physicians have to consider the therapeutic efficacy of CPR, the potential risks, and the patient's preferences.	1.0294383349705793
Acting within the context of the therapeutic process is often equated with acting-out.	0.637537466119559
Subtile behaviour, too, as a part of the "complex system of sending and receiving unconscious signals" (Sandler) which serve for the patient to induce behavior of the transference object in the analyst or fulfilling his unconscious wishes is seen as acting-out or microacting-out (Treuniet).	0.6371110548087721
However, this delicate acting has no meaning, it is not symbolic or communicative action.	0.6692765944559291
It is aimed at inducing effects and interactions.	0.31492819517462284
It appears both on the side of the analyst and of the patient and is part of the unconscious communication in the therapeutic process.	0.9064761581769709
Diverse interactive means and ways will be demonstrated, how the analyst is moved to unnoticed acting and to handling the patient in an unnoticed manner in a certain way.	0.5071553735010854
The acting-reactions of the analyst may have the character of interpretations, by which he unintentionally demonstrates, in what a way he understands the patient.	0.5852144319507956
Background: The therapy of phimosis is circumcision.	0.6907646195242847
Since many years it has been discussed, whether phimosis is treatable with local estrogen application analogous to the treatment of labial synechia in girls.	0.5638855697997139
This conservative treatment depends on the presence of estrogen receptors (er-alpha) in male prepuce-cells.	0.5914431209008708
Findings in previous investigations have indicated that contrast-enhanced colour Doppler can be used to improve the demonstration of characteristic features of neovascularization in malignancies.	0.63634794937304
However, the quantification of the increase in colour Doppler signals after Levovist in the cited study relied only on descriptive criteria defined by the investigator, resulting in a subjective scoring system.	0.5586436460216941
A computer-assisted method for quantitative analysis of colour pixel density is a novel approach for objective assessment of colour Doppler signal after contrast media administration.	0.5449999731110869
After microbubble contrast medium injection in 47 patients, carcinomas and benign lesions behaved differently regarding degree, onset and duration of Doppler enhancement.	0.4328402560962016
However, the high interindividual variability and the temporal variations of the Doppler signal still limit the value of these criteria for prospective diagnosis.	0.6763172859295244
Rapid image-acquisition techniques are needed in order to apply the necessary mathematical processing before the contrast kinetics can be used for diagnostic purposes.	0.5896398141567741
Recent studies have shown that increased intraocular pressure following keratoplasty may cause progressive endothelial cell loss and thereby lead to early transplant failure.	0.45613628404736645
This study examined risk groups for development of postoperative glaucoma and thereby transplant failure.	0.4486013892899037
Dysphagia is a common complaint following surgical intervention in the oral cavity and hypopharynx, often leading to prolonged postoperative recovery.	0.657761293421949
Videofluoroscopy allows detailed visualization of deglutition, demonstrating the morphology as well as the functional aspects.	0.49842617636310227
Therefore, videofluoroscopy provides the basis for further therapeutic management.	0.5310048426017394
We discuss the pathology of deglutition in 19 patients recovering from tumor surgery of the oro- and hypopharynx.	0.6608351725655299
In most cases the results demonstrated severe impairment of both the oral and pharyngeal phase of deglutition.	0.6989895346350417
Our data emphasize the importance of the oral phase of deglutition for preparation and initiation of the following phases.	0.746503680501948
People who suffer a stroke most often experience a major crisis in their lives.	0.3655342555544657
This leads to psychological problems which are likely to influence the patient's life satisfaction, long-term rehabilitation outcome, and quality of life as much as the physical consequences caused by the stroke.	0.6966818821895497
The patient's ability to accept the new reality created by a disability as a part of their future life is therefore essential.	0.6030389397635543
This necessitates an individual coping strategy in the center of which is a mourning process, which unfolds in the same way as other experiences of vital threat, e.g.	0.6254452688107432
confrontation with one's own dying.	0.3558864969876691
Different stages of mourning that can also be found in stroke patients are nonacceptance of the facts, erupting emotions, parting with the former and finding of a new self as well as new perspectives for one's future.	0.5849869558882844
Whether a coping process is successful does not depend on the type of the defense mechanisms or stages, but essentially on their persistence.	0.6031658617492315
It is the task of the therapeutical team to support this process by applying a basic therapeutic behavior, stage-consistent interventions and a positive feedback.	0.6122937285900456
A failed process of coping may be one of the causes of the high prevalence of psychological disorders like depression and anxiety disorders in patients having sufferd a stroke.	0.6615392053271917
A 63-year-old woman developed a pruritic exanthema on the extremities after one hour of work in her garden pond in Planegg, Southern Bavaria.	0.4738125359108203
As the appropriate vectors (ducks and snails) were present, we made the tentative diagnosis of cercarial dermatitis (swimmer's itch).	0.5351452100642191
By different serological methods (cercarial fluorescent antibody test, cercarial Hüllen reaction, circumoval precipitin test) antibodies against cercariae could be demonstrated in the serum of the patient 14 days later.	0.5889794904465531
Cercarial dermatitis appears worldwide, but in Central Europe the disease is often not recognized.	0.8871302646691817
The current adjustment of cochlear implant (CI) speech processors is based on a knowledge of the lower and upper limits (T- and C-levels) for electrical stimulus currents.	0.700490548384597
These data are usually acquired from subjective classifications of individual patients.	0.42959888582317934
In cases with non-reliable patient responses, objective methods are necessary.	0.4466194270124789
Especially for the estimation of correct T-levels, auditory evoked potentials (AEP) can be applied, since they allow the determination of response thresholds in a frequency-specific manner.	0.6595247456778787
By determining the AEP of different latencies, late cortical responses can be registered almost without artifact contamination.	0.40879991662096904
These patients have been examined in 20 patients provided with 22- or 8-channel CI-systems (Nucleus or Med-El implants).	0.674301574165564
In all cases, clear responses and clearly discernible threshold transitions could be detected.	0.47574010700120706
By making use of acoustical stimulation in a free sound field, subjective hearing threshold and the T-levels of electrical stimulation could be verified.	0.4991286845761573
Since late responses are generated in the primary auditory cortex, their assessment permits a nearly integral functional control of the aided hearing system.	0.5255882856197984
To date, no problems have occured from maturation or attentional effects in either pediatric or adult patients.	0.4166684211372865
The applicability in very young children remains to be explored.	0.33055695885935565
Laparoscopic gastric banding has become a common procedure in bariatric surgery.	0.48376180535491625
Early as well as late complications are, in comparison to conventional techniques, rare.	0.7398340890373222
Complications arising from the operative technique are: perforation, early pouch dilatation, gastric slippage, infections of the port and the band, erosion and defects of the band tube.	0.6054801538804474
Insufficient weight loss and late pouch dilatation arise from unsatisfactory compliance on the part of the patient.	0.47041019911408366
In 7.5 % of 146 cases, reoperations were necessary.	0.690886929271554
Obstruction of the pouch stoma and a slippage resulted in total food intolerance.	0.44570985918563116
After radiologic diagnosis the band system should be deflated first and a naso-gastric tube applied.	0.30245278199518616
If this does not result in the pouch collapsing, a revision operation is needed.	0.7039828434617715
The significant legal and ecomonic ramifications of a positive drug test produce an incentive among users of illicit drugs to escape detection.	0.3557552877268686
Therefore, being the easiest body fluid to handle for drug screening urine is very often manipulated to test clean.	0.4235295877542066
Methods available to cause a negative result range from substitution of urine, adulteration of the collected specimen by various chemical agents and in-vivo manipulations.	0.48505057822365244
Among these, the preferred strategy is to increase fluid intake and urine flow so as to dilute the concentration of drugs below the threshold of detection.	0.5257915990615649
To determine the extent of possible specimen dilution the urinary creatinine concentration is generally determined.	0.48991621062478174
Based on data from uncontrolled and controlled fluid intake studies in the literature and physiological conditions of urinary excretion, the meaningfulness of creatinine concentration in randomly obtained urine samples is discussed.	0.600348441258272
A low creatinine concentration not clearly proving an intentional dilution of the sample, the application of GC/MS analysis or the concentration of the urine prior to drug screening is recommended for specimens exhibiting a "suspect" urinary creatinine concentration.	0.5731949102906608
Goal: Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring has a key role within the neuromonitoring, although ICP does not monitor processes of the central neuron directly and only with delay.	0.528416560894899
One of the important factors in ICP monitoring is measurement accuracy.	0.5649462631860607
For a better understanding of ICP probes and their differences, the function and principles of intracranial pressure transducers should be evaluated from a technical point of view.	0.6238442893846278
The therapy for spontaneous or artificial perforation of the esophagus remains a controversial matter.	0.5735807953914477
The following case report deals with the medical history of an artificial esophageal perforation after operative treatment of cervical disc disease.	0.6763532735444348
A 68-year-old male patient underwent a C4/C5 and C5/C6 discectomy with interbody fusion of C7-T1 vertebral body, according to Smith-Robinson.	0.3865191198753734
During this operation, a 3-cm-long lesion was made in the posterior wall of the esophagus, which was treated 24 h later with a primary suture.	0.8888281313673531
The clinical follow-up was complicated by mediastinitis with subsequent multiorgan failure.	0.5532467207375147
After recovery from this critical condition the patient complained of severe dysphagia, which was related to a persistent lesion in the posterior esophageal wall with endoscopically demonstrated dislocation of a screw.	0.6564341722521017
After removal of the screw, the lesion was covered by means of sternocleidomastoid myoplasty.	0.6777652672930833
Moderate postoperative dysphagia was successfully treated by bougienage.	0.4641294125313389
Introduction: The loss of functional capacity by peripheral nerve lesion is easy to be estimated: A certain neurologic dysfunction results in a characteristic reduction of the former individual capacity.	0.7401304143920368
In contrast, the effect of accompanying pain to every-day life and working ability is not known exactly.	0.5606811640161556
In this study, we compared the results of judgement in nerve lesions under the circumstances of additional pain syndromes.	0.6887703613055497
The guidelines of the International Union against Cancer are generally used to assess malignancy of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.	0.6628367993101549
Beside TNM-staging, histological grading is performed.	0.4508232643432027
This system has been extended by a selection of histological parameters which were studied with respect to prognosis, based on a review of 184 patients with squamous cell carcinoma.	0.6274405289494139
An increased malignancy was found in carcinomas with the following features: clinical diameter greater than 2 cm, low degree of keratinization, high degree of cellular polymorphism, high mitotic index and high tumor thickness index (metastases only from tumor thickness 2,4 mm and subcutaneous infiltration), desmoplasia and ulceration.	0.585714346504191
Consideration of histological tumor parameters improved prognosis assessment.	0.3276448827848164
Multivariate analyses with large case series are necessary to determine ranks of the prognostic factors.	0.47369374014061943
Therefore, the data analysis of all centers that contribute to the carcinoma registry will make a precise difinition of high- and low-risk carcinomas possible and can thus influence therapy and follow-up procedures.	0.8003366627767999
Surgical closure of atrial septal defects can nowadays be performed without preoperative cardiac catheterization.	0.38557320526581423
For a transcatheter closure, however, x-ray exposure has been indispensable.	0.47688295338731224
We report a closure of an atrial septal defect under transesophageal echocardiography without fluoroscopy.	0.5011608078020241
In field research, training intensity was tested during three different dances by recording the exercise heart rates.	0.44084599915617384
The subjects (twelve women from 59 to 77 years old) were tested once a week three times, over three minutes with a break of three minutes, three weeks in all.	0.5939497178117198
The sequence of the dances changed every week.	0.3403680198169061
Measurement of baroreflex sensitivity is a new method to identify patients after myocardial infarction with a high risk for sudden cardiac death, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.	0.8240984271809347
In this retrospective study the baroreflex sensitivity was obtained noninvasively by measuring the systolic blood pressure with a FINAPRES-device and correlating this with the R-R intervals of the ECG after raising blood pressure with an intravenous dose of Norfenefrinhydrochlorid (Novadral).	0.515668825225802
According to other investigators a correlation of >0.7 with a significance of p<0.05 was recommended for evaluable results with a baroreflex sensitivity <3 ms/mm Hg being judged as decreased.	0.5952448964641212
We investigated 302 patients (mean age 59 +/- 17 years, 224 males, 78 females).	0.6242929428719939
75% of the investigations showed acceptable results.	0.5686860819819743
In 77 cases (25%) reasonable results could not be achieved.	0.5173371005607171
We found premature ventricular beats to be responsible in 18 investigations (6% of all investigations).	0.7874486582967354
41 (13.1%) of all investigations were not evaluable because of bad correlation for unknown reason.	0.6725799956131054
When we looked closely at these nonevaluable results, we found a significantly higher number of patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (<40%), diabetes or inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the electrophysiologic study in this group.	0.7571445908935147
Embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas of the female genital tract usually occur during infancy in the vagina.	0.39972035401120387
Only in rare cases can they be found in the cervix, where they are most commonly seen in adolescence.	0.6852006614023913
Their prognosis seems to be good since the introduction of a combination of surgery and chemotherapy.	0.564636236894268
We report a case of cervical embryonal rhabdomysarcoma in IRS stage Ia in a 32-year-old female.	0.5390489191646088
After surgical resection and chemotherapy there has been no evidence of disease for 7 months.	0.7528302684053274
The case is compared with the published literature and prognostically relevant features, and possible problems in the differential diagnosis in biopsies are discussed.	0.7653581580241465
Between 1987 and 1993, 41 grade 3B open tibial shaft fractures were treated with the unreamed tibial nail (URTN n = 22) or an external fixator (FIX n = 19).	0.642566897252606
The method of treatment was left to the choice of the operating surgeon.	0.8404986898419634
Three below the knee amputations were performed, three patients died, and three were lost to follow-up.	0.7069333742806687
In all, 32 patients were followed up to union or at least for 1 year.	0.7069170749104419
There were no significant statistical differences between the two groups (P<0.2, chi-squared, t-test) with respect to fracture type, fracture location, age, gender or accompanying injuries.	0.7572297689938366
The URTN group showed significantly better results regarding time to full weight-bearing (URTN 11 +/- 4 weeks; FIX 20 +/- 11 weeks, P<0.01 M-W) Mann-Whitney Test, number of reoperations (URTN 1.04; FIX 2.89; P<0.01 M-W), isolated bone grafting (URTN 3/22; FIX 8/19; P<0.05 chi-squared), and average Karlström and Olerud score (URTN 30 +/- 4; FIX 26 +/- 5; P<0.05 M-W).	0.6440768451042257
In all, 15/17 URTN patients and only 6/15 FIX patients achieved unlimited walking distance (P<0.01 M-W).	0.5207016876374748
Time to bony union, infection, and nonunion were not significantly different between groups.	0.5128992540398045
By varying the light spectrum, impulse length, impulse sequences and fluences, the PhotoDermVL allows a large choice of individual treatment parameters.	0.5131191635272925
Superficial as well as deeper localized vascular malformations (essential telangiectases, port-wine stains, Poikiloderma of Civatte, hemangiomatous malformations) and cosmetically bothering hypertrichosis can be treated successfully with this high intensity polychromatic pulsed light source.	0.4548503488136902
Catheter ablation is an established method to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.	0.5743753747940404
However, the risks of catheter ablation have to bee weight against antiarrhythmic therapy.	0.5978568919096007
With catheter ablation AV-block III °, pulmonary embolism, pericardial tamponade (in some cases followed by death), arterial embolism as well as other complications have been described.	0.6814699240918879
Especially the long term consequences of prolonged fluoroscopy time are an increased risk for fatal malignancies in young patients.	0.5680282579506621
On the other hand the efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia has been shown.	0.703226554785109
The risk of proarrhythmia associated with the treatment with class 1 and class 3 antiarrhythmic drugs that has been documented in patients after mayocardial infarction and in heart failure patients cannot be transferred to patients without structural heart disease.	0.6936417043021585
It is concluded that drug therapy is still an important form of treatment in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.	0.7284689621361441
Background: Chloroquine keratopathy is known as a disease with epithelial deposits in the cornea.	0.5687765109536554
The appearance of corneal changes does not seem to be related to dose and duration of treatment.	0.45651074674201403
The purpose of this study was to investigate microscopic changes of corneal morphology in patients treated with chloroquine in vivo.	0.5605215011337614
Dermatological rehabilitation treatment can take different forms: climato-therapy, baths, phototherapy and psychosomatic treatments.	0.3684764078132998
Which of these treatments is of most benefit to any one patient depends on his or her illness.	0.4335658062075194
Accordingly, a psychosomatic approach to dermatological illness is indicated mainly when a psychological disorder and a dermatological disease coincide.	0.46785389531296867
In addtion, dermatoses with psychological triggers or overlays, and also depression, pre-existing emotional disorders and special motivation for psychotherapy should be considered for psychosomatic treatment.	0.6168085374053108
Finally, patients who are having trouble accepting or confronting malignant skin tumours may also benefit.	0.5694073567711553
We report about the possibility of electrophysiological diagnosis and therapy in the treatment of a symptomatic left ventricular tachycardia which could not be treated effectively by oral medical therapy in a 10 year old boy with no obvious structural heart disease.	0.7787545006866496
By right bundle-bloc-like QRS-complexes in the surface-ECG, the diagnosis of the ventricular origin of the tachycardia was confirmed by transesophageal-ECG.	0.6698121677321811
This was followed by the first electrophysiological examination that showed increased leftventricular vulnerability.	0.5573186204316285
During this electrophysiological examination the tachycardia was terminated by stimulated singular premature beats.	0.3247059498453603
An oral medical therapy with sotalol was started.	0.349461439027568
After the phase of saturation the next ventricular stimulation was done, that showed no sufficient protection of sotalol against VT.	0.520747893884255
So the decision was made for ventricular ablation.	0.3422333759195844
After 5 high frequency-applications no furhter ventricular tachycardia could be induced.	0.35963317976246933
Since this intervention the patient lives without symptoms.	0.3135272355795228
The vertebral bodies and vertebral arches show a characteristic distribution of cortical and cancellous bone.	0.4047556509480672
The pedicles are loaded by uniplanar bending that is reflected by the arrangement of the Corticalis.	0.3458828687355177
The ligaments of the vertebral column consist of longitudinal and (with exception of the lig.	0.8059655268102724
longitudinale anterius) horizontal/oblique segmental ligament bundles.	0.2264512723492831
In combination with the anulus fibrosus, the ligaments work as a kind of gear system.	0.5569054240197168
They regulate the process of movements of adjactent vertebral bodies in a very precise manner and control the final phase of motion.	0.5229280120217805
Besides maintaining the necessary amount of pretension the intervertebral disc distributes the loads uniformly onto the adjacent vertebral bodies.	0.3144521631589744
The intervertebral joints are important for guided motion, by restricting the extent in specific planes and directions.	0.5279161563955377
Because of their position, they are able to take up the shear forces and to simultaneously restrict them in different planes.	0.5905088198763394
The integrity of the fascia thoracolumbalis warrants the protective function of the autochthonuos muscles.	0.3601388558963278
Prolonged immobilization or physical inactivity has been shown to produce increased bone resorption due to enhanced osteoclastic activity and diminished bone formation.	0.39648823034635905
These skeletal changes are a typical complication in tetraplegic patients, who are at risk of developing hypocalcemia.	0.6945452688739624
Hypercalciuria is the most characteristic symptom.	0.606806153175887
Risk factors for development of malignant melanoma have been investigated in several case control studies during the last decade, with some variation in results, partly with geographical region.	0.7107327283944452
Four studies have been conducted under the auspices of the Central Malignant Melanoma Registry of the German Dermatological Society; these have yielded consistent results allowing the identification of risk factors for melanoma development.	0.6483586879341952
The numbers of common melanocytic naevi, of atypical melanocytic naevi and the frequency of actinic lentigines were found by multivariate regression analysis to be the most important independent risk factors for melanoma development.	0.6849770160455365
Additional factors were hair colour, skin type and a history of naevus growth.	0.4873548383081233
A classification of relative risks was established by considering the first three risk factors mentioned, without any clear improvement of classification when further additional significant factors were taken into accout.	0.5862707929524286
For example, in individuals with more than 50 common melanocytic naevi, 5 or more atypical melanocytic naevi and simultaneous presence of actinic lentigines the risk of developing melanoma was found to be 100-fold that in persons with 10 common melanocytic naevi or fewer and without atypical melanocytic naevi or actinic lentigines.	0.6387030173945598
Early recognition of melanomas may be substantially improved if these risk factors are considered.	0.4370526990510646
Furthermore, intermittent intensive sun exposure (sunburns as indicator) before the age of 20 induces the development of melanocytic naevi, and after the age of 20 it contributes to the development of actinic lentigines; both factors are associated with an increased risk of melanoma development.	0.6856921527540643
Problem: Clinical and ultrasound data of neonatal hips were analysed to answer the question whether a neonatal screening is necessary or not.	0.6209330261018594
Method: Children born between 1.	0.4535479992092445
1995 were examined clinically and by ultrasound.	0.5433558863616601
The data were analysed by SPSS/PC.	0.531578886294835
Results: 5069 children with 10 138 hips were examined.	0.34118054885008897
85 % were mature (type I), 14 % were physiologically immature (type IIa) and 1.2 % were pathological (IIc, D, IIIa).	0.8792707483947794
The comparison shows, that from 119 hips with pathological ultrasound findings only 44 (37 %) had positive clinical findings.	0.6461098705796138
A screening that is restricted to children with positive risk factors (positive family history or breech position) would result in half of the newborns with pathological hips not being treated in time.	0.49753901115954646
The interpretation of three-dimensional (3D) structures of the coronary tree and the myocardium by a clinician demands a subjective visual integration of two-dimensional (2D) images of cardiac diagnostic procedures like coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy.	0.5400152889187083
Although in the conventional analysis of 2D display scintigraphic myocardial perfusion segments are arbitrarily assigned to three major coronary artery systems, the standard myocardial perfusion distribution territories correspond with the individual pathologic-anatomic coronary tree in only 50-60% of the patients.	0.5839599415596229
Hence, the mental integration ob both 2D images of coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy does not necessarily allow an accurate assignment of particular myocardial perfusion regions to the corresponding vessels.	0.552078827947331
For an objective assignment of each vessel segment of the coronary tree to the corresponding myocardial regions, we have developed a 3D "fusion image" technique and applied it to patients with coronary artery disease.	0.7072119278396062
Cause-and-effect relationships may be more obvious with 3D data fusion and may enable an easier comparison of anatomy and physiology.	0.43450803288829426
The physician's duty of professional discretion is one of the basic tenets at the heart of the doctor's profession.	0.5974396493175019
It is laid down in the physicians' professional code and determined ultimately by the patient's right to self-determination, which is regulated in §203 of the German Criminal Code.	0.7016994436792712
It is established in the ordinance governing physicians' work and has its origin in the patient's right of self-determination.	0.6531251095830276
It is also regulated in §203 of the German Criminal Code.	0.519823278104454
An exception can be made to the duty of professional secrecy if a patient gives express permission for this or if it is allowed or required by law.	0.5568479390796841
Some such exceptions are also specified in the German Social Code, although the physician's duty of disclosure is then always precisely stated, particularly when medical data in the strictest sense of the phrase are concerned.	0.6510475056175548
Borderline cases are described to illustrate how the rules of professional medical discretion are breached in the course of day-to-day business transacted between the statutory accident insurance firms and the physicians under contract to them, and some hints are given on how this can be avoided.	0.54569571552933
We report on a 56-year-old renal allograft recipient receiving cyclosporin A immunosuppression.	0.46384910543037233
During this therapy he subsequently developed the following cutaneous neoplasms: squamous cell carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, Bowen's disease, actinic keratosis, sebaceous hyperplasia, a dysplastic naevus and, finally a nodular malignant melanoma.	0.4943731531166346
Adverse effects of the cyclosporin A therapy are discussed, with special reference to dermatologic effects and the implications for patient and doctor.	0.7695719438035469
With Multislice Spiral Computed Tomography (MSCT), existing indications for performing CT of the chest are strengthened and new applications are emerging.	0.5074595711047966
The high speed of MSCT improves efficiency, image quality and patient comfort of "routine"- imaging of the chest.	0.7523727293212121
The ability to cover large volumes with thin slices improves the evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary nodules and allows for high-quality secondary reconstruction.	0.5655172098572944
If a comprehensive diagnosis of the mediastinal structures and the pulmonary parenchyma is desired, MSCT for the first time allows reconstruction of contiguous and high- resolution (HRCT) sections from the same set of thin-collimation raw data.	0.6285058906132427
This way, contiguous chest images of superior and HRCT sections of equal image quality compared to conventional CT scanning can be obtained.	0.4626494335803942
Vascular protocols greatly benefit from the high speed of MSCT: For imaging the thoracic aorta or pulmonary emboli (PE), the amount of contrast material can be substantially reduced.	0.5949977053834842
Owing to thin collimation, the detection-rate of small peripheral emboli can be significantly increased.	0.5562592568030703
If indicated, the entire subphrenic venous system can be evaluated during the same session, without additional contrast material.	0.6914540651990341
Abstract   Basis of the modern shoulder implants is the Neer II-system, a non constrained total shoulder prosthesis with conforming radii of curvature and improved protection against dislocation.	0.5978199768049346
The second generation of shoulder prosthesis is based on the geometric shaft design of the Neer II prosthesis and offers not only a variety of modular head- and shaft-sizes but also through different radii a physiologic rotation-translation-mechanism.	0.5628796156892589
The third generation of humeral head prosthesis carries the concept of an anatomic reconstruction one step further and enables the surgeon to adjust the inclination and the eccentric offset of the humeral head to restore the centre of rotation.	0.5381044639402082
The latest development in shoulder arthroplasty are humeral head prosthesis with a fully variable 3-dimensional modularity to independently adjust the prosthestic head position regardless of the individual shaft geometry.	0.5085636803020457
This achieves a 3-dimensional adaptability of the prosthetic head about the stem axis in the coronary and in the sagittal plane.	0.6734170457212761
Besides of the humeral shaft prosthesis an alternative concept of shoulder joint replacement is established - the replacement of the humeral head articular surface.	0.6690829870817646
A hemispheric surface prosthesis - cup arthroplasty - is cemented onto the residual humeral head, which eliminates the obligatory humeral head resection and the reaming of the medullary canal.	0.566386902138997
Bipolar shoulder prosthesis are humeral shaft prosthesis with a bi-rotational head system.	0.3837776225819834
Their indication is limited to pre-existing lesions of the rotator cuff and/or the glenoid surface.	0.6721040711227708
The inverse total shoulder prosthesis reverses the articular surface morphology of the humeral head and the glenoid.	0.5497552788200247
The hemispheric glenoid component serves as the centre of rotation for the concave epiphyseal proximal humerus component.	0.3674110929323325
This implant is especially used in cases of massive rotator cuff deficiences.	0.42263441756313835
The role of shoulder prosthesis in treating acute humeral head fractures needs special consideration.	0.45556985346364337
A fracture prosthesis has to restore the exact length of the humerus, the centre of rotation, and the anatomical retroversion.	0.8224240146015201
Positioning of the tubercula and their adequate osteosynthesis is most critical and fundamental to ensure a correct healing process.	0.4297507328463979
A failed consolidation of the tubercula does not lead to a satisfying result.	0.4705256232539265
The shoulder joint replacement can be sufficiently fixated in cemented, cementless or hybrid techniques.	0.46120389368799314
Today several component design variations of cemented glenoid implants exist.	0.24100728461354956
Their main distinction is the fixation system which can be divided into two main groups - the keel - and the peg-shaped glenoid components.	0.8102118132971606
The peg-shaped anchorage system shall guarantee a greater stability against shear-forces.	0.27385607065657913
Cementless glenoid components consist of a polyethylen inlay and a surface treated metal-back with an integrated fixation system.	0.4137460238644201
These fixation systems are object of intensive biomechanical research and range from conventional screw fixation to specialised cone systems and self-cutting cage-screw-systems.	0.40956154650147647
The critical area of cementless glenoid components is the transition zone of the PE-inlay and the metal-back because of high force development.	0.49228987076466374
The question of implanting a hemi- or total shoulder prosthesis is answered by the morphologic changes of the glenoid articular surface, which includes the size of the subchondral defect and the underlying etiology of the shoulder joint disease, and the age of the patient.	0.9393588287061146
Preoperative planning must consist of an adequate radiologic work-up - X-ray, CT or MRI - to accurately assess the glenoid morphology.	0.7396535248942953
G. Walch categorised the different glenoid lesions and developed a very important classification of possible glenoid deformations.	0.46928859139249973
To compare and evaluate the operative results one must consider the different shoulder prosthesis and the discrepancies between a hemi- and a total shoulder prosthetic replacement.	0.6919091174671103
Looking at the loosening and survival rate of the implant the results are related to the type of prosthesis and the preoperative diagnosis.	0.7938115487689741
The Neer total shoulder prosthesis has a 15 year survival rate of 87 %, compared to 74 % of the hemi-prosthesis.	0.648019162053054
The objective for the future has to be to further advance the development of prosthetic components, especially for primary joint replacement in acute humeral head fractures.	0.6819077185380762
Another point of interest is how to reduce the still existing high loosening rates of the glenoid components.	0.5083759020152568
A fairly new research-field is the computer-assisted surgery, e. g. navigation systems and robotics.	0.5227333663289059
The computer-assisted navigation could be of great advantage to accurately find the individual resection plane (inclination and restroversion) of the humeral head.	0.5628117537152115
The use of a surgery-robot could be very helpful to reproducibly achieve the desired conformity of the articular surface when preparing the glenoid.	0.5367896124456464
Two patients with complete paralysis of the axillary nerve are reported on.	0.6263546598246623
One case is well documented.	0.45287122233163474
In both cases there was very good functional adaptation, resulting from hypertrophy of the rotator cuff so that there was only a slight or no loss of movement.	0.6700569336128906
The rotator cuff should therefore be exercised at an early stage when there is isolated axillary nerve damage.	0.511358451043454
The function of the supraspinous muscle is also discussed.	0.38469728832250744
Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach (1792-1847) is generally known as the founder of modern plastic surgery.	0.48458145265680774
One focus of his work, apart from the physiology of transplantation and operative techniques, was reconstructive oral and maxillofacial surgery.	0.5159124578176695
This special aspect of plastic surgery as well as Dieffenbach's biography is presented in this historic article.	0.459041508704727
When a lifeless person is found in a bath tub, the emergency physician is obliged to give medical assistance.	0.618120796150031
If the patient is dead on arrival, the manner of death will in most cases unsettled.	0.6451733525312473
In these cases the physician should inform the police immediately.	0.595929509789053
Any alteration of the scene of death should be avoided.	0.5280885518082965
The purpose of this review is to outline the laparoscopic-endoscopic procedures that we perform for early gastric cancer.	0.5051841721847302
These procedures were applied to 29 patients.	0.475955607046193
Preoperative work-up included gastric endoscopy, barium X-ray examination, endoscopic ultrasonography, and histological examination, and surgery was performed in patients diagnosed as having mucosal gastric cancer for which endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) was difficult.	0.7569965362517784
Laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach using the lesion-lifting method, by which a wedge resection is made while pulling up the full-thickness gastric wall, was carried out in the 16 patients with lesions of the anterior wall, lesser curvature, and greater curvature of the stomach.	0.7289629796283432
On pathological examination of resected specimens, the surgical margin and lymphatic or venous invasion were negative in all these patients.	0.5853113292399813
The histological depth of the lesions was m (mucosal cancer) in 15 patients and sm1 (slight cancer infiltration into the submucosal layer) in one.	0.7192823251559239
This one patient later underwent gastrectomy but no lymph node metastases were found.	0.4506147325390059
Oral nutrition was resumed for a mean ( +/-  SD) of 2.9  +/-  0.8 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.3  +/-  3.4 days.	0.8987791688495463
The 13 patients with lesions of the posterior wall of the stomach and near the cardia or the pylorus received laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection.	0.5665261600884235
Laparotomy was required in 1 of these patients due to intraoperative hemorrhage.	0.7294849178236352
The surgical margins were negative in all 12 patients in whom laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection was successful.	0.5062421859446247
Lymphatic or venous invasion was positive in 2, both of whom had sm1 cancer lesions of both of these patients were located in the cardiac region, total gastrectomy was avoided, and careful observation is continued.	0.7383069317097728
Oral nutrition was resumed 4.0  +/-  1.6 days after operation, and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12.0  +/-  3.5 days.	0.8749952460252464
In addition, no postoperative complication was noted after either procedure, and all patients have been recurrence free for a follow-up period of 460 months.	0.7141956015348252
Selected properly, these laparoscopic endoscopic procedures are considered to be curative and minimally invasive treatments for early gastric cancer.	0.4746581212216098
Between 1988 and 1997, tumor resection was carried out in 18 irradiated patients (group 1: 36-72 Gy, 83 implants) and 22 nonirradiated patients (group 2: 92 implants) in the mandible and floor of the mouth, and these patients subsequently underwent mandibular endosseous implant rehabilitation.	0.7657715823474138
A total of 23 patients were treated with exclusively implant-supported prostheses, and 16 with implant tissue-supported constructions.	0.7291207433633732
Between 1988 and 1991, group 1 and 2 patients received implant tissue-supported prostheses (using two to four implants).	0.7524269043629795
Due to prosthesis-related pressure lesions, the strategy has now been changed.	0.5134683511462379
Since 1992, group 1 patients have received exclusively implant-supported prostheses (using five to six implants), while group 2 patients have received implant tissue-supported constructions (using four implants).	0.6748674093367607
Special criteria for the success of implant-supported maxillofacial prosthetics were drawn up.	0.5736291983154174
With an average follow-up period of 37 months, 160 fixtures (91%) were clinically osseointegrated.	0.737871594551845
Both types of restoration provided sufficient oral rehabilitation.	0.24919437878565898
However, only completely implant-supported prostheses avoided soft tissue ulcers.	0.6288396500887382
The overall success rate was about 77% after 7 years in group 1 and about 87% after 9 years in group 2.	0.8585787429986306
With regard to implants placed after strategy change, the 5-year success rate was approximately 86% (group 1) and 94% (group 2).	0.7674544816497815
In irradiated patients, an exclusively implant-supported prosthesis without any mucosal contact (thus avoiding soft tissue ulcers with a potential to develop osteoradionecrosis) should therefore be fabricated.	0.5689229253474335
Implant tissue-supported restoration is also possible in nonirradiated oral cancer patients.	0.5217647657398181
Extracorporal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been postulated as an additional therapeutic option in nonunion after fracture treatment.	0.5974429946010084
We have reexamined patients with nonunions treated at our institution to evaluate the efficacy of the method.	0.6282164620664131
In a prospective nonrandomized study patients were investigated with a minimum duration of nonunion of 6 months.	0.7735384960613463
Following 2 cycles of ESWT with 2000 impulses/18 kV, the reevaluation was performed at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment.	0.6922109863304977
A total of 27 pseudarthroses was reevaluated, in 11 one or more reosteosyntheses had been performed prior to ESWT.	0.6586103021112686
Following ESWT we found a success rate of 41 % (n = 11).	0.675597494000451
The clinical evidence of subjective, clinical improvement was found in 5 of these patients within 1 month, in all of these patients within a period of 3 months.	0.9068924401383185
Radiologic evidence of improvement occurred in none of these patients within 1 month, in all of these patients within 6 months.	0.8294305928315283
ESWT appears to represent an additional treatment option in patients with longstanding nonunion.	0.5610364291481501
If no improvement occurs, the maximum delay of reosteosynthesis is three months.	0.533982455193411
Over a period of 11 years a total of 140 liver resections for non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine hepatic metastases were performed in 127 patients (73 women, 54 men; median age 53 years).	0.5935821223683515
There were 120 first, 14 second and 6 third liver resections.	0.4874765291893004
Primary tumors were: breast cancer (n = 34), leiomyosarcoma (n = 20), pancreatic cancer (n = 16), renal cell carcinoma (n = 13), melanoma (n = 9), gastric cancer (n = 9), lung cancer (n = 6) and adrenal cancer (n = 6) and miscellaneous tumors (n = 14).	0.5589206850160384
Extrahepatic tumor manifestation (including synchronous primary tumors) was found in 69/140 cases (49 %); 61 of 120 patients with a first liver resection had extrahepatic tumor (51 %).	0.7585477005786065
In the 120 first liver resections, 82 (68 %) R0, 13 (11 %) R1 and 25 (21 %) R2 excisions were possible.	0.7056318356976358
Median survival after first liver resection was 20 months; after R0 resection a median survival of 28 months and after R1/2 resection of 8 months was achieved.	0.6080699914377574
The 5-year survival rate was 16 % for the total group, 24 % in patients with R0 resection and 0 % for R1/2 resections.	0.9518327946021893
After a second liver resection (n = 14) there was a median survival of 28 months (5-year-survival-rate of 21 %) for all patients and of 41 months (5-year survival rate 38 %) after R0 resection.	0.8633742006289734
Morbidity and mortality after the first liver resection were 32.5 % and 5.8 %, respectively.	0.9724718946792527
In patients without extrahepatic tumor at the time of the first liver resection a median survival of 32 months (5-year survival rate 25 %) and 7 months was achieved after R0 resection and R1/2 resection, respectively.	0.8010375293803341
In case of extrahepatic tumor the median survival was 24 months (5-year survival rate 23 %) for R0 resection compared to 8 months after R1/2 resection.	0.6998681925200888
These data suggest that not the presence of extrahepatic tumor but rather the possibility of a R0 resection is most decisive for the prognosis after liver resection.	0.6417878843377443
We conclude that patients with liver metastases of non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine tumors may benefit from liver resection.	0.5413717655452983
Similar to colorectal metastases, a second or third liver resection can be worthwhile in selected cases.	0.4988379949139235
Even in more unfavorable tumor entities, several cases of long-term survival were observed after surgical therapy.	0.7532036914003576
Therefore, the indication for liver resection should be considered carefully in every single case.	0.7151007692994839
Generalizations about the outcomes of psychotherapy are essentially based on research on brief therapies with quite short follow-up.	0.38659637063484603
The present paper is a survey of some of the findings in an effectiveness study of psychoanalysis and long-term psychotherapy, typically psychoanalytically oriented, in private practice.	0.7189867602436927
The design was a three-wave panel comprising more than 700 patients.	0.4230432885008562
At the end of the third wave, 418 patients in different phases of treatment remained in the sample.	0.42139612564416523
Across a reconstructed time scale covering roughly seven years, before, during, and after treatment, the 74 psychoanalysis cases described a very positive development, whereas the development among the 331 psychotherapy cases was moderately positive.	0.6771240879707066
The findings emphasize the importance of extended follow-up.	0.41924867142915384
When therapist variables are considered, therapeutic experience had complex or mixed associations with patients outcome.	0.42985777915276446
Especially positive were high age and many years, in private practice, after licensing.	0.629085279986752
Therapeutic ideals and attitudes divided the therapist group in three subgroups, one of which was characterized by purely classical psychoanalytic views on the values of support, friendliness etc.	0.5223618857365945
Therapists in the classically psychoanalytic cluster were found to do poorly with patients in psychotherapy, in contrast to patients in psychoanalysis.	0.6609575859533147
It is concluded that psychoanalysis and psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy are qualitatively different.	0.3564296248628135
Experimental studies and open clinical trials have suggested intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) as a potentially effective treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).	0.6609584331882568
The Austrian Immunoglobulin in Multiple Sclerosis (AIMS) study tested this assumption by examining 148 patients with relapsing-remitting MS in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled fashion (75 IVIg, 73 placebo).	0.49733509380696433
Monthly administration of IVIg in a dosage of 0.15-0.20 g/kg over a period of 2 years slowed the progression of or even reversed disability as evident in a total of 24% of patients and almost halved the number of relapses in comparison to placebo treatment.	0.6579130535216454
Therapeutic efficacy was noted within the first 6 months of treatment and was not correlated to the severity of disability (mild neurological sins without disability to ambulatory with assistance) at study entry.	0.6726929968085096
Overall the magnitude of treatment effects of IVIg was comparable to that reported for beta-interferon and copolymer 1.	0.551084663870547
Further ongoing studies will have to clarify the future role of IVIg in the treatment of MS, in particular in the progressive forms of the disease.	0.7232622722274514
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare cause of ischemic heart disease.	0.6136774304675945
Incidence, etiology and optimal treatment are ill-defined.	0.38316592980812586
Between July 1995 and December 1997, we prospectively identified 42 patients (36 men, six women, mean age 59 +/- 12 years) with spontaneous coronary artery dissection among 3803 consecutive angiographic examinations in which the diagnosis of coronary artery disease was established for the first time (incidence 1.1%).	0.7681031528293166
In comparison to the remaining study population with stable angina pectoris (8 cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection among 2852 patients; incidence: 0.3%), the incidence of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was significantly higher in the patient subgroups with acute myocardial infarction (13/450; 2.9%) and with unstable angina pectoris or postinfarction angina (21/501; 4.2%).	0.7755865534404146
Dissection was most frequently located in the left anterior descending coronary artery (19 cases), followed by the right coronary artery (15 cases) and the left circumflex coronary artery (8 cases).	0.8552866349091757
Because of an ambiguous angiographic lesion appearance intravascular ultrasound imaging was performed in 13 patients to confirm the diagnosis.	0.6012273404946067
The presumed etiology of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was atherosclerotic plaque rupture in 35 cases, heavy physical exercise in four cases and hormonal influences related to pregnancy and contraception in one case.	0.5016291114706519
In two cases, no obvious risk factor could be identified.	0.6465018951528891
Therapy consisted of intracoronary stenting in 24 patients (including ten patients with acute myocardial infarction), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 8 patients and balloon angioplasty (PTCA) in seven patients.	0.7814891253654257
Three patients were treated conservatively.	0.8141882564123243
Introduction: Since the introduction of laparoscopic hernioplasty the TAPP procedure (transabdominal preperitoneal approach) has become the most widely used technique.	0.6776726626470008
Many surgeons have changed to the total extraperitoneal approach (TEP), because they fear the consequences of a peritoneal lesion.	0.5607993910450074
Method: We evaluated our results with TAPP in a retrospective study, with special attention to complications caused by the approach.	0.7928915679038774
We operated on 460 hernias in 390 patients in a period of 5 years.	0.5378435926533319
Results: Complication rates and recurrence rates were similar to those after TEP.	0.6300180658454438
There was a marked learning curve with decrease of both rates during the evaluated years.	0.491417918171963
There were no complications related to the transabdominal approach other than trocar hernias, the rate of which could be reduced by eliminating the learning curve and by using smaller trocar diameter.	0.6686824536775811
Conclusion: We see no reason to change from TAPP to the TEP technique.	0.5056561663482744
This article examines the use and acceptance of ticket machines, automatic teller machines (ATMs) and telephone cards by the elderly in four European regions.	0.4954429511377402
The analyses are based on data from an international project entitled "Keeping the Elderly Mobile", collected in Mannheim (former West Germany; N=404 home-dwelling respondents), Chemnitz (former East Germany; N=400), Ancona (Italy; N=600), and Jyväskylä (Finland; N=618).	0.45666938377635424
The random sample was stratified by age and gender in each country.	0.33808158387766124
Two generations of men and women (aged 55-74 and 75+ years, respectively) participated in the study.	0.6050290028093941
Results show that respondents generally made little use of the three technologies under investigation: in fact, the majority of respondents does not use them at all.	0.6625942078806122
The most frequently used devices were ATMs in Chemnitz and ticket machines and telephone cards in Mannheim.	0.4125038548498629
On the basis of logistic regression analysis, age was the most important explanatory factor for the three technologies and for all four regions, i.e., the users were mostly the "young-old."	0.6760283123019701
Education was a more important variable than gender.	0.45705076276163203
In all four regions, the majority of the respondents who used the technologies assessed felt that each of them made life easier; nevertheless, ticket machines make life more difficult to almost every third user in Mannheim.	0.5146538948798891
Interesting differences and similarities among the towns were also found.	0.3295222372150055
The present study exhibits preliminary results regarding elderly and technology which future research should investigate in greater depth.	0.44289427723824454
In order to examine the efficacy of whole body acupuncture additionally applied to drug treatment in depression, a single-blind placebo-controlled study with 70 inpatients administered to three different treatment groups has been carried out.	0.6453832767868928
All patients were pharmacologically treated with the tetracyclic antidepressant mianserin.	0.5932075270908433
The verum group (n=22) received acupuncture at specific points considered to be effective in the treatment of depression.	0.5218965588730614
The placebo group (n=24) was treated with acupuncture at non-specific locations and the control group (n=24) received only pharmacological treatment.	0.6610271449331583
Acupuncture was applied three times a week over a period of four weeks.	0.47841978202966084
Psychopathology was rated by judges blind to verum/placebo conditions twice a week over eight weeks with the CGI, GAS, BRMS and BfS rating scales.	0.36964211992922785
Additionally applied acupuncture improved the course of depression more than pharmacological treatment with mianserin did by itself.	0.4139761829398272
However, we could not detect any differences between placebo and verum acupuncture.	0.667505570151977
Acute heart failure consists of decompensated chronic heart failure, acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.	0.4716141954299283
While decompensated heart failure shows little therapeutic difficulties therapy of pulmonary edema is more sophisticated.	0.4178319215903723
Cardiogenic shock, however is still a therapeutic challenge.	0.8837750248064228
For therapy of cardiogenic shock positive inotropes, phosphodiesterase-inhibitors and various assist devices are currently in use.	0.4885010399409188
If it is not possible to correct underlying diseases, mortality of cardiogenic shock is still high.	0.8046936688245153
Two years after the diagnosis of Sézary syndrome, a 50-year old female patient experienced attacks of painful ischemia of both hands and feet, leading to acral necrosis.	0.6390976182532644
Another 59-year old patient presented with severe pain in his feet, secondary to ischemia.	0.744343866789501
This was the first symptom of a T-cell-chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	0.8013607522189973
Similar cases have only occasionally been described.	0.3971717622205164
The relationship between acral ischemia and T-cell-lymphoma is not clear but is discussed in this article.	0.810225953225203
The clinical features of progression sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo in combina-tion with the radiologic finding of a contrast- enhancing mass within the inner auditory canal are suggestive of an acoustic neuroma.	0.576091962264062
We report our findings in a 57-year-old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease who was presumed to have a neuroma.	0.6727237984852258
A large malignant lymphoma of the cerebellopontine angle presented clinically with a primary acoustic none palsy and no other central neurological deficits.	0.4855970310147156
Both the primary radiological examinations and the exclusively peripheral nerve palsy failed to indicate manifestationes of a lymphoma.	0.455537205481781
The development of a progressive facial palsy within 8 weeks of presentation and an atypi-cal occipital headache were uncommon findings for an acoustic neuroma.	0.49461293466316686
Such changes in symptoms despite the occurrence of car-dinal symptoms require further diagnostic measures.	0.3623665490076606
Manifestations of a malignant lymphoma in the cerebellopontine angle are extremely rare.	0.6051713017586378
To our knowledge a case of an intracerebral lymphoma in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome has never been reported before.	0.7235334010164327
Cutaneous blisters on a corpse are not only of forensic interest regarding their etiology and genesis but also the time of origin, particularly the problem of vital, agonal, supravital or postmortem occurrence of cutaneous blisters could be of forensic value.	0.6434480530746767
The aim of this work was to summarize the causative spectrum of cutaneous blisters, including poisonous plants and animals, drugs and toxic substances.	0.7144508622786008
The time of origin of cutaneous blisters were evaluated in selected forensically relevant cases.	0.698542419260153
The purpose of the present study was to compare two sedation regimens with either propofol (P) or methohexital (M) for elective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with respect to safety, side effects, recovery, and discharge time.	0.8536986126157406
Pharmacological thrombolysis is a valuable therapeutic modality for embolic arterial occlusion.	0.4921295712200881
Nevertheless, thorough evaluation of the indications is imperative to avoid serious complications.	0.5590817864884131
The most frequent complication is hemorrhage.	0.6688371218589416
Of these, the intracerebral hemorrhages are rare, but when they do occur they are an immediate threat to life they are accompanied by very severe complications, and they have an extremely poor prognosis.	0.64116141978267
Within 58 months 361 patients were treated at our neurosurgical clinic with intracerebral hematomas.	0.5849102957520143
In 22 patients (6.1%) the hematoma developed as a complication of systemic thrombolysis.	0.7637255520373718
Two of these patients had been treated for occlusion of the central retinal artery.	1.0190656609708033
One patient died: the other survived but was severely disabled.	0.6868203524863554
The latter patient experienced no benefit from the thrombolysis as for as the underlying ophthalmologic disease was concerned.	0.5129526930855848
These worrying examples stress the necessity for careful evaluation of risk factors and the natural history of the underlying disease for which systemic thrombolysis is indicated.	0.6904282299798671
Local selective (or superselective) thrombolysis is preferable to the systemic procedure, provided that the indications are equally strictly observed and are less likely to lead to severe complications.	0.6266007459082665
We report on a 61-year-old patient with considerable insufficiency of a quadricuspid aortic valve and coronary three vessel disease.	0.5963450120311551
The congenital quadricuspid aortic valve has become symptomatic due to the development of (post-endocarditic) insufficiency only in the advanced stage of life.	0.5888924011126785
It was treated by replacement of the aortic valve and bypass myocardial revascularization.	0.6448595702943031
The physiopathology of quadricuspid aortic valve will be discussed.	0.2776102206106635
Due to its high prevalence, atopic dermatitis is an important problem in the dermatologic practice.	0.7237516000047687
The chronicity of the disease together with numerous triggering factors of varying individual impact create a complex situation which is difficult to manage under the current circumstances in our health care system.	0.531825831130545
We describe the concept of an outpatient clinic especially for atopic dermatitis as established in our Department of Dermatology.	0.7289432105967457
A high degree of standardization is combined with a high measure of individual care.	0.663425895380758
The aims of this clinic are an optimized outpatient management of atopic dermatitis, the gathering of epidemiologic data, the performance of controlled studies, and potentially the reduction of costs.	0.6930160685717401
Abstract:  Traumatic cerebral aneurysms are rare in severely head-injured patients.	0.5593178467125578
We present the first case of a traumatic aneurysm of the A1/A2 junction.	0.6395277203098254
Purpose: Although the relationship between optic pits and macular lesions was described nearly a century ago, the pathology and pathogenesis of macular detachment remain unclear.	0.6141456998840972
Recent OCT studies have shown schisislike spaces in connection with the disc.	0.46767595325741146
None of the hypotheses of pathogenesis proposed so far could have been proven.	0.5303279861326758
Besides the hypothesis of exudation, the role of the vitreoretinal interface is kept in the background of discussion.	0.5770351936825632
We describe a case of macular detachment associated with optic pit that regained full vision after pars plana vitrectomy with laser coagulation and gas tamponade over a follow-up of 26 months.	0.49333139467826953
The purpose of our case report is to emphasize the role of the vitreoretinal interface in the pathogenesis of macular detachment associated with optic pits.	0.6621539896727021
Sclerosing adenosis of the prostate is a benign lesion, which was not recognized until a few years ago.	0.7088641295500351
As in sclerosing adenosis of the breast, a background of various hyperplastic changes is commonly also present in the prostate.	0.5973287300979573
An incidence of 2.8 % was reported in one series of resected hyperplastic prostatic glands.	0.7143965513694128
As demonstrated in this case report, the main problem lies in the differential diagnosis between sclerosing adenosis and highly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	0.7640684529799565
Histological diagnosis of sclerosing adenosis based on routine HE sections is supplemented by immunohistochemical methods.	0.35101221032941493
Important diagnostic criteria of sclerosing adenosis are the presence of basal cell differentiation, which is demonstrated by cytokeratin 903, and signs of possible myoepithelial differentiation, with expression of S-100 and/or smooth muscle actin.	0.7468433390210258
These antibody expressions are lacking with in the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	0.3951307042457056
Nevertheless, in a small number of cases this differential diagnosis remains impossible, even after the application of immunohistochemical methods.	0.8707213628374207
Further studies are needed to shed some light on the relations between sclerosing adenosis, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	0.4662845105790136
So far, there appears to be no evidence of a direct relationship between sclerosing adenosis of the prostate and an elevated risk of carcinoma.	0.7814323077234441
Benign intracavitary cardiac tumors lead to "malignant" complications, so early diagnosis and adequate treatment are of vital importance.	0.6023356334343387
Our investigation summarizes a 10-year experience after surgical treatment of 29 patients suffering from benign intracavitary cardiac tumors.	0.5744231325829057
The postoperative histological examination revealed a myxoma in 27 cases; in 2 cases a papillary fibroelastoma was diagnosed.	0.6268090691297605
The main symptom in 19 patients was dyspnea.	0.5559316160172698
In 8 cases an embolic event occurred.	0.45315165924374684
All patients underwent extirpation of the tumor.	0.6630651960807212
Early mortality was 10 %, while late mortality was 4 %.	0.5866912836715817
The treatment of choice of benign intracavitary cardiac tumors is extirpation, which, due to unpredictable embolic complications, is to be carried out immediately should the tumor have a lobulated tuberous surface.	0.6804496444823491
In such cases the descriptive function of echocardiography is of considerable importance.	0.4813434655801863
We present a case of a 48 year old man who complained of progressive dyspnoe.	0.7228266093815326
Radiograph revealed a large tumor in the left lung.	0.8237061300607624
Biopsy was performed and revealed beneath a normal bronchial epithelium polymorph tumor cells admixed with some histiocytes.	0.435547712797932
These tumor cells were strongly pigmented and expressed HMB-45 and protein S-100 immunohistochemically.	0.5223255675399104
Malignant melanoma of the bronchus was included in the differential diagnosis.	0.5272867336107909
A thoracotomy and left lower lobe resection was performed.	0.3994156206035934
The lung is an uncommon localisation of angiomyolipoma with so far three reported cases.	0.517011275602986
Lipoma, leiomyoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis have to be included in the differential diagnosis.	0.472691512586248
The peculiarity of this case is the presence of multiple pigmented tumor cells that express HMB-45.	0.5895887405082931
This has not been reported yet.	0.7293199948403204
Background: The maximum number of cell divisions of a certain cell population is genetically fixed so that aging cells become non-dividing (senescent) at least.	0.6112074470044588
This replicative life span, also known as "hayflick limit", is probably defined by a "critical" length of the telomeres.	0.6054420929599206
Telomeres are special DNA-sequences located at the four ends of the chromosomes which are shortened with each cell cycle.	0.43385729933535017
Cells of most, but not all malignant tumours have been shown to reactivate the enzyme telomerase so that telomeres can be reconstructed, "Hayflick limit" can be overcome, and unlimited cell division can be established.	0.6702694120655297
This study was undertaken to elucidate whether telomerase reactivation is used by uveal melanoma cells.	0.5107590933932433
A total of 113 patients with acute and chronic instability of the ulnar collateral ligament metacarpal phalangeal (MP) joint of the thumb were treated surgically between 1980 and 1985; 82 patients were followed up after a mean period of 10 years.	0.677039745021908
Of 59 patients with acute injuries, 52 were painfree with full stability of the MP joint; 23 patients with chronic instability and tendon grafting also showed restoration of stability.	0.6177177099543357
Nevertheless, the range of motion was reduced severely and opposition of the thumb was impaired.	0.6654433726028848
The results of follow-up reveal that acute reattachment of the injured ulnar collateral ligament is more effective.	0.614197209781504
The purpose of this study was to assess the role of spiral computed tomography (SCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the preoperative work-up of patients with pancreatic carcinoma, regarding local resectability and vascular involvement.	0.6722427685300945
Methods and materials: A total of 28 patients (19 men and 9 women; mean age 58 years) with known or highly suspected carcinoma of the pancreas were included in this study.	0.7853307028784599
All patients prospectively underwent MRI ( +/-  gadolinium-DTPA) and SCT (3-phase examination) as preoperative diagnostic imaging studies, and laparotomy was carried out within 7 days, irrespective of the MRI or SCT findings.	0.7405093008912561
SCT and MR studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, without knowing the results of the surgical exploration.	0.6890487600810841
Standardized image analysis was correlated with findings at laparatomy.	0.34043491008684945
Results: Laparotomy identified 10 patients to be suitable for surgical resection and 18 pancreatic carcinomas to be unresectable.	0.5684152913582473
In 17 of 18 non-resectable carcinomas MRI and SCT were able to obtain correct information about unresectability (sensitivity 94 %), in 7 (MRI), resp.	0.6241008463006613
8 (SCT) carcinomas were correctly considered to be resectable (sensitivity 70 % for MRI and 80 % for SCT).	0.7947008426897062
The presence of vascular involvement was depicted by SCT with a sensitivity of 82-100 % and 62-100 % by MRI.	0.6561867432648014
The specificity varied between 85-100 % for SCT and 77-100 % for MRI.	0.7943331293146731
Conclusion: Both MRI and SCT are good techniques for the preoperative work-up of pancreatic carcinomas in order to obtain a correct assessment of local resectability.	0.6797463921176159
Pancreatic pseudocysts occur as a complication in the natural course of acute or chronic pancreatitis, with a spontaneous resolution rate of 40 % to 60 %.	0.8031122727174721
The incidence of pseudocysts in the course of chronic pancreatitis amounts to 60 %.	0.5450426799891945
Pseudocysts have to be differentiated from neoplastic or congenital pancreatic cystic lesions.	0.42111660105327703
Careful diagnostic work-up including ERCP and CT scanning is mandatory in the management of pancreatic pseudocysts.	0.39008443828797784
The indication for treatment depends on the development of symptoms or complications.	0.5914762325088238
Pain is present in up to 90 % of all patients, and the rate of complications varies between 2 % and 55 %.	0.9129691310377193
Pancreatic pseudocysts are usually an epiphenomenon of chronic pancreatitis.	0.4983042769613257
Pancreatic resection therefore represents a causative treatment.	0.23574157917225524
New percutaneous and endoscopic techniques for draining pseudocysts are challenging the previous hegemony of the surgeon.	0.3555153831229036
However, so far no prospectively collected data are available comparing the results of interventional and surgical drainage procedures.	0.6980201028686492
Therefore, in most symptomatic cases surgery is considered the treatment of choice.	0.8483443146548922
A 28-year-old drug addict who had injected intravenously died of hepatic failure and coma caused by fulminant hepatitis (simultaneously: hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C and superinfection by delta hepatitis).	0.4672140039534434
Liver histology disclosed cirrhosis with severe necrotizing hepatitis and extensive microvesicular steatosis, compatible with a delta virus infection.	0.31520612386756724
Moderate pulmonary fat embolism (grade I-II according to Falzi) was accompanied by fat deposits in alveolar macrophages.	0.6100552212763275
It is postulated that protracted fat mobilization from necrotizing hepatocytes may be the cause of pulmonary fat embolism; the extravasation of fat from the vessels into the alveoli results in phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages.	0.4887933541095265
Suicide on railways (either by being run over by or jumping in front of a train) is one of the 'hardest' suicide methods.	0.5189983274596255
In Austria, 617 suicides or attempted suicides on railways were registered between 1990 and 1994.	0.3275161464434289
This amounts to 5.73 % of all suicides committed in this period with women showing a higher percentage than men.	0.6627912342257005
In both men and women there was a predominance of younger age groups; the mean age was higher in women than in men (48.0 vs 40.4 years).	0.8107323288021192
There was a significant increase in suicides or attempted suicides on railways after a television report on the stress suffered by train drivers concerning possible suicides.	0.4997198936310011
Persuading the mass media to treat the subject of 'suicide' with reserve and with greater caution, even when not presenting a distinct suicide model, may be of importance in general suicide prevention.	0.6537059341157814
For decades the results of elective lymph node dissection (ELND) are differently discussed, so that it is not definitely recommended at present the less so since the morbidity of this operation can't be neglected.	0.6374234068728887
Since the beginning of 1995 we practice a gamma-probe guided sentinel lymphonodectomy (SLNE) on patients with melanoma from a Breslow tumor thickness of 1 mm upward, after injecting a colloidal 99m-Tc labelled tin (II) - sulfid solution around the tumor or the scar, if the tumor has been excided before.	0.5610700584780051
By this method, that allows a selection of patients who according clinically to a stage I or II (UICC) but even histopathologically to a stage III and who are profiting of a removal of the regional lymph nodes, the sentinel node can be exactly localised, tissue-sparing removed at minimal complication rates and the completeness of the removal can be verified by measurements of the radioactivity.	0.6998164622691997
When finding metastases in the histopathological examination of the node a dissection of the whole region follows.	0.6017855195017938
During rehabilitation of patients suffering from a recent hip fracture, we evaluated the development of several aspects of their subjective well-being (n=87, age: 70 to 94).	0.6617462303817303
In most cases, a deterioration of subjective well-being due to the consequences of the hip fracture could be prevented; the well-being improved in most cases.	0.8090036601987899
When discharged, the subjective well-being of our patients was comparable to the well-being of similar-aged people living at home.	0.8740433016560629
Antidepressants are used in demented patients for treating depressive symptoms as well as other non-cognitive symptoms including agitation, aggression and irritability.	0.4743946195918596
As patients are usually elderly, a dose adjustment is mandatory for all classes of antidepressants.	0.5662163547467353
New antidepressants such as the SSRIs and the reversible MAO inhibitors should be the first-line agents in these patients, because their efficacy is not different from that of classic TCA, but they have advantages regarding frequency of adverse effects, ease of use and safety.	0.6590214938602954
Improvement in cognitive performance, however, may not be expected from the new antidepressants.	0.5919860580951115
For the treatment of agitation, aggression and irritabiltiy, antipychotics and benzodiazepines are in frequent use, although their adverse effects are particularly problematic in demented patiens.	0.46821799461324076
Good alternatives are the antidepressant trazodone and citalopram.	0.26180755949964857
All medications mentioned have been studied on small patient samples, so treatment recommendations must be given cautiously.	0.5669222672595368
The application of laser energy to joint capsular tissues resulted in the reduction of the joint capsule.	0.6420543026296202
Primary clinical results of combined laser-assisted capsular shrinkage (LACS) and multiple suture repair (Caspari) for arthroscopic stabilization procedure of anterior shoulder instability are presented.	0.6545205774572108
From July 1997 to October 1998, 18 patients (2 female, 16 male; mean age 27.9 years; range 16-42 years) with anterior instability and recurrent dislocations of the shoulder received a combined arthroscopic stabilization procedure.	0.827707756684896
The operative technique involved the use of transglenoid sutures to repair the labrum and shift the capsule (Caspari) and LACS.	0.5246712766832753
Laser energy was applied using a Ho: YAG laser (10 W, 1 J, 10 pulses/s, total energy: 1500-2000 J).	0.6025706550669704
The patients were followed for an average of 9 months (range 4-20 months).	0.9041590895383932
From June 1992 to Februrary 1996, arthroscopic suture stabilization without laser shrinkage was performed on 17 patients (2 female, 15 male; age 25.9 years/range 18-37 years).	0.6416016288839935
The average follow-up in this group was 4.5 years (range 2-5.5 years), and we found 41.2% (7/17) recurrent dislocations.	1.0069075554319176
After combined arthroscopic procedure of multiple suture repair (Caspari) and LACS, a significantly (chi-squared test, P = 0.05) lower recurrence rate was obtained.	0.6077918697907716
Only in one patient (5.6%, 1/18) did we find this failure.	0.8509728023126099
No complications occurred in either group.	0.2849061968425493
The combination of arthroscopic LACS and Caspari's technique of multiple suture repair in cases of posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability and recurrent dislocations is promising.	0.5615879672121914
Although, no long-term results are available, the method seems to be suitable for associating low recurrence rates with the advantages of arthroscopic surgery.	0.7807800602417756
Simple bone cysts are asymptomatic, benign lesions which are usually an incidental finding on a radiograph.	0.560082278319466
Etiology and treatment are controversially discussed.	0.5602746415017182
The weightbearing status of the calcaneus and possible pathologic fracturing lead many authors to recommend therapeutic measures after diagnosis has been made.	0.5271254726273316
We present a case report of an intact unicameral bone cyst of the calcaneus concomitant with tibial and talar fractures following crush trauma.	0.6640799856321953
Several types of treatment for simple bone cysts of the calcaneus have been suggested.	0.609726654197975
The question whether treatment is unconditionally necessary is controversially discussed.	0.4074408313168076
It is the author's opinion, that asymptomatic bone cysts of the calcaneus require no further treatment.	0.6902181992497701
Facial neuromyography is an objective electrophysiologic measurement used to assess prognosis for recovery from facial paralysis.	0.40884242000024235
In the present study variability over time of the amplitude ratio in healthy subjects was investigated.	0.7227415577659417
Twenty healthy subjects underwent four neuromyographic tests at intervals of one week.	0.31053112615658035
The study group consisted of 12 males and 8 females.	0.5384652822218251
Ages ranged from 23 to 36 years.	0.25082198970329517
The stimulation intensity required for supramaximal stimulation was 14.6 mA on average.	0.48921637117064104
The mean of the intra-individual side-to-side difference of the evoked compound action potential was 32.5%.	0.5408666982396776
Results of the four repeated tests ranged from no to 80% side-to-side differences in the same individual.	0.7079286912992945
The hypothesis of symmetrical evoked facial compound potentials was not supported by our data.	0.3922969789732117
As with previous investigators we found significant side-to-side differences in healthy subjects.	0.48935987523510344
Furthermore, we could also show for the first time that the amplitude ratio was not constant in every individual at repeated measurements.	0.716588296797357
We conclude that there is a physiological variability that must be taken into account in the interpretation of facial nerve neuromyography.	0.5871465840025916
To compare patient dose and image quality of electron-beam-CT vs. spiral-CT by means of phantom measurements.	0.5414468092460956
An EBCT scanner (C-150 XP) and a spiral-CT scanner (GE  HiSpeed Advantage) were used to scan three different phantoms.	0.7315593897325019
Administered dose, high contrast (HC) resolution, low contrast (LC) lesion detectability and the width of the radiation beams were measured.	0.5773304730979993
EBCT showed 25-35% lower HC resolution in comparison to spiral-CT. LC lesion detectability showed equivalent results for S/N vs. patient dose using 3 mm collimation with EBCT and spiral-CT, whereas spiral-CT was superior for 1,5 and 6 mm collimation.	0.6192677034016881
Dose measurements revealed a 2 fold higher patient dose using EBCT with 1,5 mm or 6 mm collimation compared to spiral-CT using equivalent scan parameters.	0.529639237679997
No differences were seen using 3 mm collimation.	0.473589801869685
Differences were due to insufficient beamside collimation of the EBCT.	0.353521292126218
The use of EBCT with 6 mm collimation should be avoided, because of impaired performance.	0.7209780162290679
Using 3 mm collimation, EBCT showed comparable performance like state of the art spiral-CT despite lower HC resolution.	0.5325666902187001
In an experimental study, the biomechanical qualities of the combined Kirschner wire osteosynthesis (KWO) in the unstable Colles' fracture were analyzed.	0.6176016685128058
This type of pin fixation is our preferred osteosynthesis in the treatment of unstable Colles' fracture because it allows immediate functional therapy.	0.5135644688723033
It represents a modification of Kapandji's dynamic KWO, compensating for the insufficient volar stability by means of the conventional static KWO.	0.4603530096284497
Clinical experience according to the anatomical and functional results, was very encouraging suggesting that a clinical concept based on the biomechanical principles of combined KWO and its single components should be constituted.	0.6901788519439874
Simulation of the unstable Colles' fracture was realized by dorsal wedge osteotomy of the distal end of the radius using cadaveric material.	0.5434319544139911
This fracture model was subsequently pinned using the different KWO types and tested by a standardized vector energy testing device regarding its stability in the four main loading directions.	0.4944537655738132
The combined KWO unifies the advantage of volar stability of the conventional KWO with the high dorsal stability of dynamic KWO.	0.5787329572689175
The main functional principle of dynamic KWO with regard to its axial stability consists in the repositioning of the dorsal bone fragmentation zone and hence the reconstitution of cortical load transmission.	0.4699787269420708
Besides its good stabilization, dynamic KWO also leads to optimal alignment of the distal metaphyseal fragment.	0.5530393098975932
Furthermore, the experiments yielded important information about technical aspects of the surgical procedure, which helps us to avoid anatomical and functional deficiencies.	0.7304828155413807
Based on these experimental findings, the surgical technique of combined KWO was standardized.	0.863297749006342
Purpose: It is difficult to measure the topography of the cornea with high resolution and visualize it on a map displaying refraction.	0.6346930681698452
This is demonstrated by the ongoing improvement and further development of different methods and by the fact that users of these techniques are not always satisfied.	0.7996848898772223
We present the case of a 2-year-old boy who was brought to hospital with extensive scalding of the face.	0.7435494494057503
The clinicians raised the suspicion of a physical maltreatment of the child.	0.4470509085694493
Because of the morphological findings the medico-legal expert came to the conclusion that maltreatment was proven.	0.5056966761393006
During the criminal proceedings at the appeal court contrary opinions on the morphological findings of the injury between the clinical expert and the medico-legal expert became obvious.	0.6023662566973804
Findings of the physical examination of the child and the experimental studies on immersion and pouring of water and the influence of clothing in case of wetting with hot water were presented which confirmed that the injury was caused by maltreatment.	0.5910558605079791
The opinion of the clinical expert which supported the case of the accused could be refuted.	0.646811937762177
During the final legal proceedings the opinions of the clinical expert had been sufficient for the court to justify an acquittal "in dubio pro reo".	0.5169360229567694
Anterior thoracoscopic interbody stabilization and fusion was performed in 163 patients.	0.5291139650722042
Lesions treated were located between T4 and L3, most frequently occuring at T12/L2.	0.4416761512766223
Operative time decreased dramatically as experience was gained with the procedure.	0.30546828144858346
2 patients early in the series successfully were converted to an open procedure.	0.3893197258318155
One positioning related pressure harm on the thoracodorsal nerve and one irritation of the L1 root at the entrance site were both transitory.	0.346220502639226
Postoperative control by X-ray and CTscan showed correct positioning of the bone graft, as well as the fixation device in all patients.	0.7157770595376426
Our experience with this minimally invasive procedure demonstrated the feasibility of the method.	0.6446832864020958
Major advantages compared to the open procedure are reduced morbidity of the approach, postoperative pain reduction, early recovery of function and shortened hospital stay.	0.6648334657844157
In order to restore function and esthetics in mandibular hypoplasia, transplantation of osteochondral grafts and the distraction osteogenesis technique are used alternatively.	0.4709959394318428
In a retrospective study the indication, growth and complication rate of osteochondral graft and distraction osteogenesis cases in mandibular hypoplasia were compared.	0.5937505629923183
In total, 12 patients (4-14 years old; 7 female, 5 male) with different grades of mandibular hypoplasia received osteochondral grafts (7 costochondral, 5 iliac crest; observation period 4-9 years).	0.752468966460238
In 5 patients (10-12 years old; 1 female, 4 male), distraction osteogenesis was performed (observation period 10 months to 3 1/2 years).	0.6887897933016749
In the results, according to the literature, the range of growth after osteochondral grafting varied considerably, approximate normal growth was noticed in only two cases.	0.549450091085225
On the other hand, all patients treated by distraction osteogenesis showed a stable increase of bone length as expected.	0.6685349014315002
After osteochondral grafts, adequate growth is to be expected in the minority of cases and it does not seem predictable in individual cases.	0.7047923253721632
Therefore, the indication for osteochondral grafts should be restricted to severe hypoplasia, where the local amount of bone does not allow the use of a distraction device, and to cases where support of the mandibula at the skull base is necessary.	0.7447308556487225
In all other cases of mandibular hypoplasia in children, distraction osteogenesis should be discussed as the primary option, even if in the long term a second surgical procedure should be necesssary.	0.7063758960764484
To evaluate the predictive value of MRI in the early postoperative course after cruciate ligament replacement, a prospective study was performed.	0.9393279251529436
Twenty patients with reconstructed anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament were examined clinically and with contrast-enhanced MRI 2, 12, 24 weeks, 1 and 2 years postoperatively.	0.7255673106660424
The clinical examinations were evaluated according to the scores by Lysholm, OAK and IKDC.	0.3966861011244985
The MRI scans (SP 63, 1.5 Tesla) were evaluated regarding the quality and signal intensity of the reconstructed ligament.	0.8583242691776886
During the first postoperative year a significant increase in signal intensity and inhomogeneity of the neoligament in MRI was observed in 16 patients with an average value for signal/noise of 1.1 2 weeks postoperatively up to 6.9 1 year postoperatively.	0.8386337247693617
In 12 patients the reconstructed ligament could not be evaluated in the 1-year postoperative MRI, whereas none of these patients was suspected clinically of having instability.	0.8635445100118522
In the 2-year postoperative MRI, the signal intensity of the neoligament was found to be decreasing again with improvement in judgement.	0.7027743935935585
Miniplate osteosynthesis is a standard method for the surgical treatment of mandible fractures today.	0.7056966891054601
Apart from easy handling, in the majority of cases it also ensures adequate fracture stability.	0.6525006137767887
The treatment of fractures of very atrophic mandibles as well as mandibular defects and comminuted fractures with miniplates and rigid plates is often difficult or only possible to an inadequate extent.	0.5424853222586902
Titanium mesh has proved successful for the treatment of such fractures.	0.5097849516898693
Compared with conventional miniplates this mesh is outstanding for its considerably higher stability due to its given geometry.	0.4249771516790516
The titanium mesh can be adapted and screwed individually in any situation, in contrast to miniplates and rigid plates.	0.5083854248192645
As a result, complications such as fracture gap infections and pseudoarthrosis can be avoided to a great extent.	0.6076831208939362
Non-invasive methods to identify absent or persistent myocardial viability have gained increasing importance in the therapeutic management and risk stratification of patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.	0.6899307802911252
Myocardial scintigraphy using thallium-201 and positron emission tomography with metabolic imaging of myocardial glucose metabolism, using fluorine-18 fluoro-deoxyglucose, are today the most widely used nuclear methods for the assessment of myocardial viability.	0.5463600956751153
Besides the prediction of reversible regional and global myocardial dysfunction following coronary revascularization, both methods have demonstrated the ability to identify patient subgroups who will benefit most with regard to cardiac prognosis and survival and those patients in whom coronary revascularization has a limited effect with regard to survival and cardiac events.	0.576300998208531
This short review summarizes the clinical impact of both imaging modalities on todays diagnostic approach in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.	0.4158630367762307
An elderly woman was found dead in her farm house lying in a pool of blood and was partially unclothed.	0.43109068221015545
Blood was also discovered in several rooms on the first floor.	0.47422028228801444
The investigation at the scene led to the conclusion of a sexual murder.	0.7242264928950126
The autopsy however revealed the source of the hemorrhage to be a renal artery aneurysm which had ruptured in the adjacent renal pelvis.	0.6149004514279227
The woman has obviously been surprised by the sudden bleeding which produced the impressive pattern of blood stains on the floor and finally a fatal hemorrhage.	0.36506462965322856
A similar case of a ruptured renal artery aneurysm and bleeding to death via the urinary tract has not yet been described.	0.6227964274999005
In the ankle (talocrural) joint, the lower end of the tibia and fibula embrace the trochlea tali.	0.7243826458164265
Thus, an approximately uniaxial joint is formed which permits dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot against the leg.	0.5491078681354922
Due to the geometry of the trochlea tali, conjunct lateral rotation of the fibula against the tibia occurs at the tibiofibular articulations synchronously with active dorsiflexion at the ankle joint.	0.49457762227119645
Movements at the talocrural joints are mainly limited by the opposing muscles as well as by strong collateral ligaments.	0.4757455217716674
Talus and calcaneus form a functional unit connected by posterior and anterior articulations.	0.39758119488368837
The posterior articulation is the subtalar (talocalcaneal) joint; in the anterior articulation, talar facets of the calcaneus together with the posterior surface of the navicular and the superior fibrocartilaginous surface of the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament form a concavity for the talar head.	0.575267304713579
Thus, the talocalcaneonavicular joint is a compound and - like the subtalar joint - a multiaxial articulation.	0.7413843610561534
On the weight-bearing foot, the distal tarsus and metatarsus are pronated and supinated against the talus in order to maintain plantigrade contact.	0.48674071934629304
When the foot is off the ground, these movements are modified to eversion and inversion, also involving the calcaneocuboid joint.	0.5203508580161077
In addition, movements between the calcaneus and cuboid also occur during pronative or supinative changes between the fore- and hindfoot.	0.5162453059960522
Limitation of movements is due to leg muscles as well as strong ligaments.	0.3794398078831864
Finally, the cuneonavicular, cuboideonavicular, intercuneiform and cuneocuboid joints permit some additional alterations of the loaded foot in contact with the ground.	0.44991567767491725
A case of primary splenic angiosarcoma with involvement of two accessory spleens is presented.	0.4484554074713799
The tumor cells are immunoreactive for endothelial markers (CD 31, CD 34, factor VIII associated antigen) and express also histiocytic antigens (CD 68, lysozyme, Cathepsin D, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin) as well as CD 8.	0.5887544972833264
This marker profile suggests that the presented angiosarcoma originates from sinus cells with  histiocytic and endothelial differentiation and may be regarded as the malignant variant of littoral cells angioma.	0.5413413759401707
Despite major advances in knowledge and development of efficient techniques for pain control, many patients on surgical wards suffer from modest to severe pain following surgery or trauma.	0.5242227596866408
Therefore, in the University Hospital of Kiel, Germany, an anaesthesiology-based acute pain service (APS) was started in 1985 to improve this situation.	0.7165469562455895
The anaesthesiologist in training who manages the recovery unit serves as an APS for surgical wards and is supervised by a consultant.	0.4686380406813476
The anaesthesists on call are responsible after regular working hours.	0.23764687053236802
The activities of the APS are as follows: 1.	0.433413053415788
Induction of sufficient postoperative analgesia in the recovery unit for all surgical patients.	0.5649633618043403
Clinical rounds on all patients receiving epidural analgesia (EA), other forms of regional analgesia, or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) every morning and throughout the day if necessary.	0.5860983244316685
Additional consultations for postoperative pain management for other patients on request.	0.5071584575503602
Assessment and documentation of the clinical status of the patient, quality of analgesia, and side effects.	0.8496889678965702
Writing orders for further treatment.	0.315750564935702
Continuing consultations and informal education for ward nurses, physiotherapists, and surgical staff; formal medical training for ward nurses in postoperative pain management.	0.5659107209219677
From 1985 to 1992, 1947 patients on normal wards were treated (EA: 1736, PCA: 183).	0.38882838465491104
Epidural analgesia was performed using a standard protocol with bupivacaine 0.175% - 0.25% infused continuously with top-ups if needed (mean 240 mg/day, range 75 - 600 mg; median duration 7 days, range 1 - 53, Table 1).	0.7211383034668932
Demand for further treatment was proved by day-to-day withdrawal.	0.5398449349231984
Since the introduction of an APS, complications of EA such as hypotension (1985/1986: 5.1%; 1987/1992: 0.5%, Table 3) and insufficient analgesia due to dislocation or other technical complications could be reduced significantly (Table 3).	0.6663048868412131
Dermal infections were seen in 2.6% of patients, with a significantly higher incidence in patients with arteriosclerotic diseases (4.1%).	0.9210708670990708
Epidural opioids were used in only 46 selected cases on surgical wards.	0.48451197140916624
Nevertheless, 2 cases of marked respiratory depression occurred.	0.6560768109128375
The overall risk of complications during postoperative EA could be reduced from 1 : 11 cases in the first 2 years to 1 : 20 in the last 6 years since introducing the APS.	0.6720252661218795
For other regional procedures (e.g., interpleural analgesia) no complications were recorded.	0.4723410891838846
PCA was performed using a standard protocol with tramadol or piritramide without background infusion (Table 6).	0.5556224900293774
The loading dose was titrated in the recovery unit.	0.4649455437517175
The median duration of PCA was 4 days (range 1 - 23); the median dose of piritramide was 45 mg/day (range 3 - 226 mg).	0.7308526075898195
Two cases of somnolence and respiratory depression occurred.	0.45979130478918634
In this period there were 8 potential life-threatening complications due to postoperative pain therapy; 4 occurred during standard surgical pain management (3 cases of severe respiratory depression after i.m.	0.7802374560768794
piritramide (unsuccessfull resuscitation), tramadol, and buprenorphine; 1 small child with multiorgan failure after paracetamol intoxication).	0.45329169786534357
In those cases the APS was not involved.	0.46148650278502895
There are insufficient data for comparison of the incidence of complications following standard management of postoperative pain relief without an APS, i.e., i.m.	0.6316316116150036
injections of opioids on request, but severe and sometimes lethal complications have been reported.	0.5906580559523313
Since the majority of patients used EA or PCA for several days, it is again emphasised that these techniques should not be restricted to high-dependency areas such as intensive care or recovery units.	0.5749635299674496
The introduction of an APS is an adequate approach to more efficient and safer pain management on surgical wards.	0.4586378743430991
This requires standard protocols (Table 7), standardised monitoring and trained ward nurses.	0.48171403179638833
Lambdoid synostosis can manifest unilaterally, bilaterally or in combination with other craniosynostoses.	0.38420838131160534
Using the concept of fronto-orbital advancement we developed occipital advancement in order to correct unilateral or bilateral lambdoid synostosis.	0.44157317157880355
The process involves striped transversal osteotomy, removal, remodelling and advancement of the occipital region.	0.41882187399574444
It allows precise, reproducible and predictable positioning of the segments.	0.45521303767815924
Artificial sutures are created as a result of the osteotomy.	0.49127616288761794
The remodelling leads to a well-proportioned skull shape and advancement to an increase in the intracranial volume.	0.5578063772077764

Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy is a rare neoplasm of neural crest origin.	0.5732333171828967
It almost always occurs in children younger than one year of age with a predilection for the anterior maxillary ridge.	0.5113452018336352
Although it usually follows a benign course, local destruction as well as metastasis and death may result from the tumor.	0.6536496042751061
Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor is most commonly treated by surgery.	0.4345383715686523
10-15% of the lesions recur.	0.8884689580663192
We report the case of a 2-month-old infant suffering from melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy of the premaxilla who was successfully treated with a combination of various chemotherapeutic agents in order to spare the child a mutilating operation or the late effects of radiation.	0.5792170685679466
Computer-assisted techniques were introduced in spine surgery in the 1990s to improve accuracy and safety of operative procedures.	0.6359852286796368
Several reports on clinical results of computer-aided screw insertion in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine as well as the sacro-iliac joints are available.	0.651484193571527
They show a significant decrease of screw malplacement rates as compared to conventional insertion techniques.	0.6270833014626738
Over the past years, antioxidants, and particularly vitamin E, have received considerable attention in the treatment of human diseases.	0.710967943440693
In rheumatology, interest has been given to the treatment and prevention of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.	0.7732102188160173
However, the concept of using antioxidant nutrients as potential remedies is not new.	0.5153853977993568
As early as the sixties, first case reports have described beneficial effects of vitamin E in the therapy of osteoarthritis.	0.580049971014699
Nonetheless, most of the following studies were not conducted properly, thus, not allowing valid inferences about the efficacy of vitamin E. Newer studies with sound methodology have shown a beneficial effect in rheumatic diseases, mainly in the reduction of pain.	0.7545100676261384
This paper reviews current and past studies about vitamin E in the treatment of rheumatic diseases.	0.5310887797689997
Patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (i.v.-PCA) represents the gold standard in the management of acute postoperative pain.	0.638292428221314
However, in many countries i.v.-PCA is rarely used.	0.7960936727359647
Recent clinical studies demonstrated that intranasal fentanyl titration provides a rapid and safe form and pain management.	0.4795671704315837
In the present study we investigated patients' acceptance and assessment of patient-controlled intranasal analgesia (PCINA) and compared it to intravenous PCA and the customarily prescribed pain therapy.	0.6503752708056263
Unreamed nailing with solid tibial nails is an accepted method of treatment for open tibial shaft fractures up to grade III and of closed tibial fractures with severe soft tissue damage.	0.5684125218640134
However, fatigue failure of the distal locking bolts is a frequent complication.	0.8883828360452561
We report a mechanical study investigating the fatigue limit of six different types of locking bolts used in solid tibial nails (Biorigid Tibial nail/aap, UTN/ace, STN/Howmedica, TLN/Howmedica, R & T Tibial nail/Smith & Nephew, AO/ASIF UTN/Synthes).	0.421485323434432
Our results prove a direct correlation between the bolt's diameter and mechanical properties.	0.4399435626239875
Further more we found that bolts with a continuing thread were weaker than bolts of the same diameter with only a short thread and an increased diameter at the nail's aperture.	0.5297127076488184
Our results suggest that mobilization with half of the average body weight (350N) allows osseous consolidation without fatigue failure of any of the tested locking bolts.	0.5131124214198329
Some of the tested locking bolts may even withstand full weight-bearing in a physiological walking cycle, but will not withstand the stress of a running cycle.	0.5243733249458559
Voiding dysfunctions secondary to failure of adequate relaxation of the striated urinary sphincter or the smooth bladder neck should be considered in children with urinary day time incontinence and/or enuresis and recurrent urinary tract infections.	0.5335516160957998
The urodynamic findings resemble to those obtained in neuropathic bladders, but only a minority of the children suffer from neurologic disorders or anatomical obstruction.	0.6069770425289847
In the majority of cases a developmental delay of the central nervous system responsible for urinary control is assumed.	0.5323968081006434
Behavioural disturbances play another important etiological role.	0.19842757464814378
Therapy is based on behavioural modification.	0.3581568559145712
We report on two patients with granulomatous rosacea and another patient with granulomatous perioral dermatitis who responded well to dapsone.	0.5723831315076489
Dapsone has a pharmacological double function as both an antibiotic and an antiphlogistic drug.	0.34198072645880107
Before the introduction of isotretinoin, dapsone had its place in the treatment of severe acne.	0.5141098812396598
To date, its use in granulomatous rosacea has not been described.	0.7033205719004084
When hematologic parameters are monitored, dapsone is considered a safe and cost-effective drug, especially in countries where isotretinoin is not readily available.	0.664983383176883
However, the definite value of dapsone in granulomatous rosacea should be established by a controlled study.	0.5921633755091005
Anaesthesia both for adenotomy (AT) and for tonsillectomy (TE) frequently presents a challenge.	0.6191091286542222
On one hand, children scheduled for adenotomy often have upper airway infections and are thus at risk of laryngo- and bronchospasm; on the other hand the ENT surgeon and the anaesthetist have to share the "workspace" in the patient's mouth.	0.7747947593024305
Since the succinyl choline debate in the early 1990s, the question of the best muscle relaxant has gone hand in hand with that of the most appropriate means of securing the airway.	0.7022237655377609
The concept of the laryngeal mask as airway was initially greeted with scepticism.	0.46229125591598946
Following several years' use of the mask for this purpose in AT and TE in young children, we report our experience and summarise the literature on this topic.	0.7288844935777189
The laryngeal mask represents a safe alternative to intubation, provided there is close cooperation with the ENT surgeon.	0.6427127399740253
Topical corticosteroids (CS) are frequently used to treat of allergic contact dermatitis, so that their own potential for sensitization is rarely detected.	0.674115220814066
However, increasing numbers of hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids have been reported during the last 10 years, and allergic skin reactions to over 50 particular compounds have been observed.	0.7115871554682842
CS must now be regarded as a rather frequent contact allergen, the prevalence being twice as high in women as in men.	0.5994777656275265
Contact allergy to CS is clinically characterized by a chronic and persistent, corticosteroid-resistant dermatitis.	0.48266548100381934
In general, hypersensitivity to CS is a type I and/or type IV mediated allergic reaction.	0.5357975439223933
Cross-sensitivity between individual corticosteroid preparations has been described owing to their closely related chemical structures (e.g.	0.39317773574576725
hydrocortisone and tixocortol pivalate).	0.1229063027937644
Contact allergy to CS can be confirmed by patch-tests, intradermal injection tests or application tests; because of the delayed appearance of positive skin reactions a prolonged evaluation period of up to 120 h is recommended.	0.4785638816859658
For routine screening the use of the patient's own material and of tixocortol pivalate and budesonide as test marker substances seems appropriate.	0.5845040369907446
The development of further marker substances is a target for ongoing research.	0.3949457024475937
The alliance concepts are defined as being the description of the dynamic interaction of all cognitive and emotional factors which promote the analytic process.	0.561883385234363
The historical significance and the development of the three predominant alliance concepts, these being the implicit "standard alliance" of Freud, Zetzel's therapeutic alliance and Greenson's working alliance, are to be described.	0.6425416523027097
All alliance concepts refer to a general, essentially reality-oriented relationship anchored in the personal and the human domain, which forms the background for the therapeutic process and the basis for the analytic interpretation work.	0.6559873482863576
Nonetheless, the dynamic force of the alliances is substantiated by factors of the transference.	0.6350070317624866
The alliances are therefore not faced with the transference, but rather with the resistance.	0.6282326493852315
We report on a 15-months-old girl with a history of recurrent phlegmones of the lower eyelid, dacryocystitides, conjunctivities and mucositis together with growth-retardation, chronic obstipation and anal prolaps.	0.5861219541153746
During a period of 19 days absolute neutropenia was observed.	0.3047500258432699
Retrospectively, neutrophil counts were between 0-500/µl from birth on.	0.3439482422400468
Bone marrow biopsy revealed an arrest of maturation of granulopoiesis at the stage of promyelocytes.	0.45171751983960035
Continuous therapy with 10  µg/kg/d of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) induced 12-day oscillations of blood neutrophil counts.	0.5994122225022456
There were no oscillations of counts of other blood cell lines.	0.5495028030131152
Growth retardation and prolaps of anus normalized, and few intercurrent bacterial infections, pneumonia and impetigo contagiosa occurred.	0.4490089444618194
A mutation in the G-CSF-receptor gene was not found in this patient.	0.6852334970810671
After 2 years of therapy, a reduction of rhG-CSF dose (application every 2 days) lead to a severe neutropenia.	0.6714509808671202
We report a 31-year-old renal transplant patient treated with cyclosporin A who developed an unusual sebaceous gland hyperplasia accompanied by a disseminated follicular spiny hyperkeratosis.	0.570708157381347
Those alterations were most evident on his face and limbs.	0.3656489410050835
In some locations hairy hyperkeratosis with authentic hair neogenesis was found.	0.21079980384310157
The histology of these alterations showed a marked hyperkeratosis of the hair follicles with formation of hair-like spikes either alone or in connection with hairs.	0.6285133943537928
The presence of true hairs distinguishes our case from the morphologically similar disseminated spiked hyperkeratosis and other spiny keratinization disorders.	0.32138780569728254
Scanning electron microscopy helped to demonstrate the hair-like structure of these keratoses.	0.5162769097403633
Some of the sebaceous glands showed cystic widening of their lumina, which were filled with abundant amorphous eosinophilic material, a finding similar to earlier observations.	0.6170326784160043
Our case demonstrates that these skin alterations should be classified as side effects of cyclosporin A and that they are apparently dose-dependent.	0.5601686568294258
Background: Since increased intraoperative iris irritation can lead to increased postoperative inflammation, we are interested in postoperative reactions to several varied surgical procedures.	0.5982691070291553
We performed pupil stretching, iridotomy with iris suture, and partial sphincterectomy.	0.5008428609727874
Reports of accidental alkaloid-intoxications with plants of the nightshade family, in  particular Datura-species are well known in pediatric care.	0.4900885663431089
The intentional abuse as a hallucinogenic drug in adolescents became more frequent in recent years.	0.4056666861977654
Two patients, a 14- resp.	0.576992870961392
16-year old boy were admitted to the intensive care units of our hospitals  because of a severe central anticholinergic syndrome after ingestion of tea from Angel's Trumpet blossoms for experimental reasons.	0.6670526891775529
Patient's history in the first somnolent patient was not available at the time of admission, a routine immunological drug screening of the patient's urine had been negative.	0.8012557983323596
In the present case of a granular cell tumor an abdomino-thoracal resection of the esophagus was performed in a 41-year-old patient after preoperative diagnosis had suggested esophageal cancer.	0.7645813632797142
Granular cell tumors (Abrikossoff's tumor) of the esophagus are rather rare tumors of neuroectodermal benign histogenesis.	0.6210273518313205
Diagnosis can be obtained by endoscopic and histological study and immunohistochemical forceps biopsy.	0.5391475107725271
Because of the peculiar histological feature of the tumor, it can be mistaken for an squamous cell carcinoma.	0.7202653184539398
In the guidelines for determination of the blood alcohol level for forensic purposes, a correction factor of 1.2 has been established for the conversion of serum alcohol into blood alcohol based on the relationship of the water content between serum and whole blood.	0.796472718479582
The reliability of the determination of the blood alcohol level is dependent on the possible minimum and maximum values of this correction factor.	0.6031934958905859
In a comprehensive multicenter study consisting of 833 samples, which can be considered representative of persons involved in offences under the drinking and driving act, an average quotient of 1.16 was found with minimum and maximum values of 1.08 and 1.21 respectively.	0.6760636843175989
In 96% of the cases the quotient was between 1.13 and 1.19 and the deviation of the quotient from the average value was less than 3%.	0.7583987210109876
From these results it can be assumed that the determination of blood alcohol is obviously more reliable than previously presumed.	0.6097237688612365
In Germany, if the dermatologist has definite proof that a patient's skin disorder is severe or chronic, work-related and requiring a change in occupation, then he or she must issue a Berufskrankheitenanzeige (loosely translated as occupational disease notification).	0.5421905169938751
The patient's consent is not required for this mandatory form, which has to be submitted even if the patient is opposed.	0.8702889679070515
On the other hand, if there is only a possible connection between the occupation and the skin disorder, or if the skin disease is neither severe nor chronic nor threatening pursuit of the occupation, then the dermatologist needs only write a Hautarztbericht (dermatologist's report).	0.5927368666737436
The patient's permission is required for this less formal document.	0.6457370471896527
Bone marrow involvement is often observed in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors.	0.5200767233957839
Sensitive immunological and molecular biological methods allow the detection of isolated transformed cells in bone marrow samples.	0.5203251903693752
Like normal hematopoietic cells, tumor cells interact with bone marrow stroma through adhesion molecules.	0.4686073908455213
Since adhesion mulecules play an essential role in the invasion and proliferation of malignant cells, new therapeutic approaches involving the inhibition of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are conceivable.	0.5647881502885485
With the development of powerful computer systems, computer-assisted medical diagnosis and therapy have become common over the last 10 years.	0.6199743575663695
Even in the surgical field, computer- and robotic-assisted techniques are becoming practical but are not yet used on a daily basis.	0.6945599205597357
In the orthopaedic field, computer and robotic assistance is used in planning and performing demanding three-dimensional osteotomies, setting pedicle screws in the spine and milling the femoral medullary canal in total hip replacement.	0.5546488620246691
This article introduces a computer- and robotic-assisted system for performing arthroplasty in total knee replacement procedures.	0.5321116071963239
The hand is very exposed to injuries in the daily man's work.	0.5732269285988281
The multiple functions of the hand are based on vitality, sensibility, motor function and stability.	0.555249987884934
In severe hand injuries the functional results of the repair are often very poor.	0.6846839891936531
In a complex injury of the hand we are faced with the damage of the soft tissue and bone and the loss of vitality and function of the hand.	0.8039747534124339
The cause of hand injuries are mainly a crush trauma or the rotating saw.	0.464691837366799
Basically, we recommend an extended primary repair.	0.7419229900421634
After the radical debridement we have to reconstruct the damaged structures.	0.5009677185610487
We start doing the osteosynthesis and stabilization of the joints.	0.5042223696122092
Thereafter, suturing of extensor and flexor tendons.	0.25911609920870915
Then, we do the microsurgical reconstructions of vessels and nerves.	0.6032234471450038
In case tendons and bones are exposed we have to cover the defect with a pedicled or a free flap.	0.5736387285549118
In a long ischemic time we have to change our concept and do the reconstruction of the vessels first.	0.6669170200508816
Our results in vitality and sensibility are listed.	0.2764958472286424
In the result of a complex hand injury each single functional restoration is very important.	0.5794386753527853
Therefore, it is necessary that severe hand injuries are treated at well established centres for hand surgery.	0.6675151777702991
A 34-year-old women had a hen's egg-sized supernumerary mammary gland with no nipple or areola in the left anterior axillary line for the last 8 years.	0.486114267443527
The main complaint about the axillary "lump" was that it was aesthetically displeasing, and it was excised.	0.6486176069851619
The importance of an axillary breast lies in the possibility that pathologic changes could develop in its substance and that clinically it could be confused with a lipoma.	0.5159267644756443
Early diagnosis and correct excision are usually recommended.	0.42961400486068413
Paclitaxel and docetaxel are potent drugs that are effective in the treatment of malignant tumors.	0.49691832066144764
The cytotoxic action of these drugs is not fully understood, but it appears to be mediated mainly through mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis.	0.666841986286146
Because no information is available on the antiangiogenesis action of docetaxel, the investigations were performed to determine whether inhibition of neoangiogenesis plays a role in docetaxel's antitumor efficacy.	0.6793479124515971
Four different mouse tumors, two squamous cell carcinomas (SCC-IV; SCC-VII) and two adenocarcinomas (MCA-4; MCA-29) were assayed for angiogenic activity using the in vivo i.c.	0.6103482562285685
Tumor cells (5 x 105) were injected i.c.	0.7628021049601695
into the skin flap over the abdominal wall, and the number of new blood vessels at the tumor cell injection site was determined 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days later.	0.825821786766264
The mice were treated with docetaxel (Taxotere - 31.3 mg/kg i.v.)	0.600688658050342
1 or 4 days after tumor cell injection.	0.5165609970103677
The number of new blood vessels increased with time.	0.37198961853067664
Docetaxel reduced the number of newly formed blood vessels in MCAs, but not in SCCs.	0.7686387939895617
The reduction was associated with slower tumor growth.	0.3315562079298012
In a separate set of experiments we observed that docetaxel's inhibitory effect on the two MCAs was histologically associated with massive tumor cell destruction by means of both apoptosis and necrosis.	0.5020987833533295
This was not observed for the two SCCs.	0.7469663916181126
Since no reduction in blood vessels occurred in tumors unresponsive to docetaxel, the inhibition of neoangiogenesis in docetaxel-responsive tumors was likely the result of a decrease in angiogenic stimuli due to docetaxel's destruction of tumor cells.	0.5619249664528168
A patient on long term parenteral nutrition developed acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin changes.	0.32483929571105497
Just as in the autosomal recessive disorder, acrodermatitis enteropathica, the lesions in our patient were caused by zinc deficiency.	0.7024576161009222
Replacement therapy with zinc led to rapid improvement.	0.2743210036090948
A measurement system was developed that permits objective comparisons of the sound conduction of middle ear implants.	0.4369704577552003
The implants are fitted into a mechanical middle ear model which approximates the impedances of the eardrum and the inner ear.	0.41692638029497303
A defined signal within the frequency range of 0-5 kHz is provided by a miniaturized loudspeaker at the input to the model and is  measured by a probe microphone.	0.5662026989377967
Displacement of an artificial stapes footplate at the output of the model is measured by a fiberoptic probe with a sensitivity of 5 nm.	0.5209138393128323
The transmission function is calculated as the quotient of the output and the input signal.	0.45785434369431766
This system can be used to evaluate the sound-transmitting properties of different middle ear implants excepting other influences, such as surgical techniques.	0.618355979688493
This work details the measurement system and demonstrates basic influences on the sound-transmission of middle ear implants.	0.48417855522623876
In acute myocardial infarction intracoronary stenting is superior to PTCA regarding interventional success and occurrence of cardiac events.	0.35911475004971505
It is, however, uncertain whether myocardial function also improves with stenting.	0.32787165736165946
We, therefore, assessed angiographic parameters of myocardial function in patients with acute myocardial infarction who were treated with primary PTCA and received additional stenting in case of an unsatisfactory angiographic result (provisional stenting).	0.6615451622732544
In order to perform accurate low-flow anaesthesia ventilation, it is desirable to avoid the influence of fresh gas flow (FGF) and inspiration duration (ID) on the resulting minute volume (MV).	0.7039696514805782
The Sulla 808V anaesthesia ventilator (Draeger, Luebeck, Germany) is originally not equipped with a fresh-gas decoupling (FGD) device.	0.4875660741203449
Therefore, changes of FGF and ID settings applied during controlled ventilation may lead to alterations of the resulting MV.	0.5337474205042135
Recently, a low-cost FGD device (Carbamed, Bern-Liebefeld, Switzerland) has been developed, which can be inserted into the circle system.	0.6509400054625636
We investigated the effect of this device on MV in the Sulla 808V anaesthesia apparatus.	0.503706412573221
Background: In a multicenter study the association of psychosocial stress and the use of psychosocial support in patients with diabetes mellitus was evaluated.	0.7218858897210271
The diagnosis Prader-Willi-Syndrome (PWS) in the neonate is difficult because features like neonatal hypotonia and feeding problems are easily misdiagnosed as a consequence of peripartal asphyxia.	0.5159775126970682
Craniofacial abnormalities like narrow bifrontal diameter, almond shaped palpebral fissures and openend downturned mouth are underdiagnosed especially if respiratory treatment is necessary.	0.2943526828604983
Hypogonadism in girls and in milder expression in boys (for example cryptorchism) are common and unspecific signs at that age.	0.5463170749066004
Typical features like obesity and hyperphagia, small hands and feet and small stature are not expressed until the second year.	0.47760585460548305
The clinical course of PWS in the neonate is demonstrated in two cases.	0.6430803179113819
Diagnostic criteria and therapeutic intervention are discussed.	0.48031024073363665
Hydrops fetalis as a seldom feature in PWS has to be taken into consideration.	0.3840102584414062
Diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) are an instrument for classification of inpatient cases.	0.678977945230259
DRGs are finding ever broader implementation internationally.	0.17341001862646999
Targets for using DRGs are hospital financing and budgeting, cost accounting and quality assurance.	0.4123413419340526
The present survey covering 18 countries shows that so far DRGs are most frequently used for budgeting purposes.	0.5085860308345592
In addition to DRG-based reimbursement, further quality assurance is necessary, but this is only being implemented with hesitation.	0.6765933882116762
The coverage planned for all inpatient cases through DRG-based reimbursement in Germany from 2003 on is a pioneering challenge internationally.	0.3869936531209845
Background: By law, applicants for driver's licenses not only have to have sufficient vision, but also have to use this sight reliably.	0.581917427965692
The nystagmus patient takes advantage of ocularly induced head turns and other forms of compensation.	0.3022528384345335
In the approved test procedures he is deprived of such compensations.	0.2982236909601985
Sinde the introduction of the bladder drainage technique, the number of pancreas transplants performed has now reached 1000/year worldwide.	0.538850247078252
Most of these transplants have been performed in the United States.	0.7058266892044421
In contrast, the number of pancreas transplants performed in the Eurotransplant community has remained at a low level for several years.	0.5372575408992656
The results of a consecutive series of 20 simultaneous pancreas/kidney grafts (SPK) performed between June 1994 and October 1995 demonstrate that high graft function rates of 83.5 % for pancreas and kidney grafts can be achieved.	0.6153857262735708
Therefore SPK can be recommended as a standard procedure for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease in Germany, too.	0.6773459710855432
Intubation and Positive End Expiratory Pressure Ventilation (PEEP) is a well established therapeutic strategy for impaired lung function, particularly following blunt chest trauma.	0.6636412594882921
Complications of this regime are however also well known and pose the question why non-invasive forms of respiratory assistance such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) have only gained minor popularity.	0.5527838984228608
In a prospective study, 30 patients who had suffered blunt chest trauma were treated with CPAP administered by mask.	0.7575718214399138
The regime consisted of continuous administration of CPAP by a face-mask, with gradually increasing periods of spontaneous breathing.	0.46859439610522907
Initially a FiO2 of 0.33 (range 0,28-0,38) proved necessary.	0.7219538057942789
The initial CPAP level was 7 mbar (range 5-8) with an (Assisted Spontaneous Breathing) ASB of 15 mbar (range 13-18).	0.7535454846026366
FiO2 and CPAP/ASB levels were subsequently gradually reduced until no longer necessary.	0.28345877538187864
In all patients intubation and ventilation was avoided by this regimen.	0.5899071369949077
The treatment was well accepted by all patients and common ventilation associated complications such as pneumonia did not occur.	0.560404481237234
In comparison with the former standard method of treatment the average ICU stay was dramatically reduced, principally due to not having to gradually wean patients from ventilation and sedation.	0.5331122302668457
Other positive benefits include normal communication and feeding with active early mobilisation leading to faster recovery, both physical and psychological.	0.4641974660044907
We conclude that non-invasive respiratory techniques should be used more frequently and recommend further studies are undertaken to define the indications.	0.6456111451848334
Abstract:  Clinical findings and the correct assessment of the morphology and degree of stenosis is a decidant point in the conservative and operative therapy of carotid stenosis.	0.7148867675326871
Diagnosis should be reached fast, sure and cost-effective with a high sensitivity and specifity.	0.662970636624201
Current methods for articular cartilage repair are unpredictable with respect to clinical success.	0.4222369392307364
In the present study, we investigated the ability of cells from articular cartilage, perichondrium, and costochondral resting zone to form new cartilage when loaded onto biodegradable scaffolds and implanted into calf muscle pouches of nu/nu mice.	0.5763427604337344
Prior in vitro studies showed that platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), but not transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor, or bone morphogenetic protein-2 promoted proliferation and extracellular matrix sulfation of resting zone chondrocytes without causing the cells to exhibit a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype.	0.6062667236307929
TGF-1 has also been shown to stimulate chondrogenesis by multipotent chondroprogenitor cells like those in the perichondrium.	0.5122305614803174
In addition, PDGF-BB has been shown to modulate chondrogensis by resting zone cells implanted in poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffolds.	0.49680944762253776
In the present study we examined whether the cartilage formation is dependent on state of chondrocyte maturation and whether the pretreatment of chondrocytes with growth factors has an influence on the cartilage formation.	0.6675896538127785
Scaffolds were manufactured from 80 % PLG with a 75:25 lactide:glycolide ratio and 20 % modified PLG with a 50:50 lactide:glycolide ratio (PLG-H scaffolds).	0.5218591009584049
For each experimental group, four nude mice received two identical implants, one in each calf muscle resulting in an N = 8 implants: PLG-H scaffolds alone; PLG-H scaffolds with cells derived from either the femoral articular cartilage, costochondral periochondrium, or costochondral resting zone cartilage of 125 g male Sprague-Dawley rats; PLG-H scaffolds with either articular chondrocytes or resting zone chondrocytes that were pretreated with 37,5 ng/ml rhPDGF-BB for 4 h or 24 h before implantation, or with perichondrial cells treated with PDGF-BB plus 0,22 ng/ml rhTGF-1 for 4 h and 24 h. At 4 or 8 weeks after implantation, samples were harvested and analyzed histomorphometrically for new cartilage formed, area of residual implant and area of fibrous connective tissue.	0.5272111506897423
Only resting zone cells showed the ability to form new cartilage at a heterotopic site in this study.	0.5357676519746577
There was no neocartilage found in nude mice with implants loaded with either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells.	0.39080524716895515
Pretreatment of resting zone chondrocytes for 4 h prior to implantation significantly increased the amount of newly formed cartilage after 8 weeks and suppressed chondrocyte hypertrophy.	0.585659283205814
The amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells decreased with time, whereas the amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing resting zone chondrocytes pretreated with PDGF-BB was increased.	0.44994180517080323
The results showed that resting zone cells can be successfully incorporated into biodegradable porous PLG scaffolds and can induce new cartilage formation in a non-weight-bearing site.	0.5677619878748437
Articular chondrocytes as well as perichondrial cells did not have the capacity for neochondrogenesis when implanted heterotopically in this model.	0.46488758308914546
Bone tumors represent a group of tumors of various dignity.	0.5271681091930875
In spite of this single tumor entities may display strong morphological resemblance to each other which can in turn result in profound difficulties in differential diagnosis.	0.40313145882045043
The biological behaviour of a tumor is mainly determined by its rate of proliferation.	0.6174354845791312
In this study the rate of proliferation of 64 bone tumors (30 high-grade central osteosarcomas, 6 low-grade osteosarcomas, 8 giant cell tumors, 8 aneurysmatic bone cysts, 5 osteoidosteomas/osteoblastomas, 7 fibrous dysplasias and 5 cases of a myositis ossificans) were analysed.	0.8497607142669132
Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections using the MIB-1 monoclonal antibody.	0.5449693069394602
MIB-1 recognizes the proliferation-associated Ki-67 protein which is expressed during the active phases of the cell cycle but cannot be detected in senescent cells.	0.5728998450301706
Among high-grade central osteosarcomas a significantly higher rate of proliferation (average value 30 %) was found in comparison with low-grade osteosarcomas and other benign intraosseous bone tumors.	0.8785160666286296
This approach proved to be very useful in the distinction between high-grade and low-grade osteosarcomas as well as bone-forming intraosseous tumors.	0.8279226003763253
However distinguishing low-grade osteosarcomas from benign bone tumors by determining only the rate of proliferation was not possible, although interestingly, the proliferative rate of myositis ossificans, a purely reactive lesion, was in the range of the values determined for high-grade osteosarcoma.	0.7642531567279728
Over the past century numerous graft materials have been used for the reconstruction of the cruciate ligament of the knee.	0.7204785112726906
Among the autologous tissues that are currently recommended as graft materials, the central bone patellar tendon bone graft, a quadrupled hamstring graft and the central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance.	0.5570023207184899
With some limitations, allograft materials can also be used.	0.48081048272822774
Each of the three mentioned grafts has specific features regarding morphological and structural properties, graft fixation and graft incorporation.	0.5128770427034343
Clinical studies have failed to identify any of the three grafts as superior to the others.	0.6875375146256982
When choosing the graft for surgery the different anatomy and function of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments have to be considered.	0.6193078242111746
For the treatment of multiple ligament injuries and for revision cases, thorough preoperative planning is necessary and modified graft selection may be required.	0.5890654680755821
Myasthenic crisis is a lifethreatening complication of myasthenia gravis due to respiratory failure and inability to swallow and cough up secretions.	0.4317803204849522
Frequent causes are intercurrent infections, fluctuations due to the natural history of the disease and insufficient immunosuppressive treatment prior to the crisis.	0.694517115381859
Early referral to an experienced neurologist is essential.	0.26831084096454494
Specific therapy consists of symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, crisis management with plasmapheresis or immunoglobulins and immunosuppression with clucocorticoids.	0.3804288136618721
Infections must be treated vigorously.	0.24321285686740382
Thymectomy in patients with previously unrecognized myasthenia gravis is never urgently indicated and should be postponed until the patient is stabilized.	0.5455140005647854
In cases of impending respiratory failure and severe swallowing difficulties, early and elective admission to a specialized neurological intensive care unit and elective intubation should be performed.	0.6033924621376517
Adequate nursing care of intubated patients and a set of prophylactic measures are essential to avoid complications adversely affecting prognosis.	0.4820493672063539
Whenever it can be achieved, the best therapy of myasthenic crisis is its prevention by appropriate long-term management and follow-up of patients with myasthenia gravis.	0.7986025140297321
In a retrospective analysis we evaluated 48 patients who had been arthroscopically treated for tendinitis calcarea.	0.7478530602271061
The calcific deposit was removed whenever possible and all patients were treated by arthroscopic subacromial decompression.	0.7447045552115478
In subjects who showed subacromial stenosis by X-ray or by intraoperative findings, an arthroscopic acromioplasty was performed.	0.5563049217369869
At follow-up all patients were evaluated according to the Constant score.	0.6932760049018377
Additionally all pre- and postoperative X-rays were reviewed.	0.7454915520357935
After surgery the Constant score significantly improved.	0.49631801118263874
In all cases where acromioplasty was performed, a flattening of the bony configuration was achieved.	0.6814228350582914
The X-ray analysis showed that no calcific deposit with blurred borders converted to sharp borders.	0.41469610808881974
There was also no deposit that converted from a transparent appearance to a dense structure.	0.4396112258494357
Patients with disappearance of the calcific deposit postoperatively had significantly better outcome than patients with no change in the X-ray.	0.4696412783386439
An additional acromioplasty did not improve the results.	0.3410401695178089
The aim of arthroscopic treatment of calcific tendinitis has to be the removal of the calcific deposit.	0.8092958547537358
Acromioplasty does not lead to further improvement of the result.	0.6428776130736976
Preventive strategies aim to reduce gastric acidity (H2ms (sucralfate, antacids, pirenzepine) and to normalize gastric mucosal microcirculation (sucralfate, pirenzepine).	0.47457022959824485
Thus, the most important prophylactic measure is an optimized emergency and ICU regime aiming to improve oxygenation and microcirculation.	0.6200311774509042
All specific drugs used for stress ulcer prophylaxis have been shown to be effective in prospective controlled studies.	0.48201196854792794
Furthermore, pirenzepine has been found to be superior to H2-antagonists, at least in neurosurgical patients.	0.5997399181258424
Insufficient or no data exist to support the use of prostaglandins or omeprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.	0.4012615598947393
The most important adverse effect of stress ulcer prophylaxis is nosocomial pneumonia due to gastric alkalinization.	0.45972416920207104
This may occur in long-term ventilated patients with a gastric pH>4 and may account for up to 50% of all nosocomial pneumonias in certain groups of patients.	0.7629255126610593
Mortality is not influenced by antacids or H2-antagonists, while sucralfate has been shown to reduce mortality, most probably by inhibition of bacterial translocation.	0.604107029567796
Three years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy, a 66-year-old man suffered from dyspnea and showed symptoms mainly due to right heart failure.	0.5638890137289416
Malignant tumor cells were discovered within extensive pleural effusion.	0.4605803831869676
Computed tomography revealed two lesions of the liver suspicious of metastases, and recurrent blood in the stools was evident.	0.6543126600142956
The patient deteriorated rapidly and died 3 weeks after admission.	0.41923094935570265
Autopsy findings included an adenocarcinoma of the cecum (grade II) with metastases to the liver.	0.7316340165782217
High-grade immunoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of plasmoblastic differentiation was diagnosed, located within the mediastinal soft tissue and infiltrating the peri- and myocardium.	0.5677897660070024
Mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged with histological verification of malignant lymphoma.	0.4729820014018496
The lymphatic tumor masses had caused considerable compression of the heart and vessels, leading to the signs of cardiac failure.	0.6456903093750043
The development of metastasizing colonic carcinoma and high-grade immunoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 3 years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy must be considered an unusual combination.	0.6273515602482519
Malignant lymphomas following heart transplantation have been described several times.	0.5553163131131414
Infection rates are important markers for clinical quality assurance.	0.3608685438264239
For internal control, they may only be used under the condition of homogeneous data collection and evaluation according to identical standard operating procedures during the entire investigation period.	0.5536480095110599
For inter-hospital comparison, they may only be used if additionally the observed patient groups are well defined and comparable.	0.5543060824777738
A survey of the infection rates published during the last 6 years in the German traumatological literature (n = 71) indeed shows (concerning series later than 1985) similar infection rates for procedures in less and in more problematic anatomical regions and in clean and contaminated situations of about 2 - 3%, after open injuries sporadically max.	0.6496724233368357
Finally, it is demonstrated that conclusions concerning a general "risk of infection" based on infection rates for specific surgical procedures are not possible and vice versa.	0.7024508350544395
We strongly recommend the future application of a standardized definition of wound infection.	0.5032349793517131
The differentiation between deep and superficial infection should be abandoned.	0.5212704246677805
For all mentioned "infection rates" it should be indicated whether it is with reference to the risk of infection of a specific procedure or only a general statement.	0.630050832553757
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are useful techniques for the objective documentation of the relation between the femoral head and the acetabulum after closed or open reduction of a developmental dislocation of the hip joint.	0.7039325131890021
Before the ossification nucleus of the femoral head is sufficiently developed, MRI is preferred.	0.6515878291724256
For the evaluation of reduction from the 2nd year on, MRI and CT are equivalent.	0.5691509054987978
However, in older children MRI may also be indicated for the evaluation of cartilaginous structures or the diagnosis of femoral head necrosis.	0.7313048500491806
CT in older patients may also be useful for 30 analysis of bony structures, e. g. for planning complex osteotomies.	0.6174823635143328
Careful diagnostic and early therapy are especially important in cases of scaphoid fractures.	0.49734281511089623
This is due to the patients being mostly young and the high number of non-unions of these carpal bones.	0.6310662807772267
Conservative and various operative treatments are therapeutical options.	0.3147989160566749
Out of the patients who underwent surgery from January 1993 to February 1999 42 patients with a scaphoid fracture and 88 patients with a scaphoid non-union were, in addition to standard X-ray examination, examined clinically and by MRI pre- and post-operatively.	0.8882319773438524
Fractures of the scaphoid were treated by Herbert screw fixtion.	0.6521821883775063
When there is a possibility that tissue samples have been interchanged, DNA analysis of the histological specimens can be carried out to correctly assign the specimens to a patient.	0.5861343799216563

A review of 110 children with Burkitt's lymphoma admitted to the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu during a 7-year period revealed a preponderance of males over females (1.9 : 1) and a peak incidence at five years.	0.7282693598867636
The main sites affected initially by the tumour in order of frequency were the face and abdomen.	0.4983547683333833
The spinal column, spleen, and lungs were less affected.	0.6430817659698743
It is postulated that an interaction between malarial and Epstein-Barr virus infections and malnutrition are important in the aetiology of the tumour.	0.6018325111100475
The most effective drug is cyclophosphamide.	0.5859750721666973
A combination of this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in inducing remissions, but is better than the single agent in preventing systemic relapse.	0.6406890471269672
Follow-up of the patients revealed good survival.	1.1196946931484315
The consumption of the jet set drug Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymetamphetamine, abbreviated to MDMA) by young people is increasing markedly.	0.6208135012275344

The term "mild cognitive impairment" refers to cognitive deficits which exceed normal physiological aging processes, but do not fulfill the criteria for dementia.	0.48645792111307645
The prevalence rates of four current concepts were compared in a sample of 202 healthy 60-64 year-old participants recruited from the interdisciplinary longitudinal study on adult development and aging (ILSE).	0.47369986047820306
Furthermore, the relationships between cognitive deficits and psychological and sociodemographic variables were examined.	0.5371980516133608
The following prevalence rates were determined: 13.5% for age-associated memory impairment, 6.5% for age-consistent memory impairment, 1.5% for late-life forgetfulness and 23.5% for aging-associated cognitive decline.	0.8118368974691623
Subjective cognitive complaints did not correlate with results obtained from neuropsychological tests.	0.4584918917924669
Significant correlations were however found between subjective cognitive complaints and higher scores on depression and neuroticism scales.	0.40751601651766156
Significant correlations were also found between a reduced test performance and a lower educational level and socioeconomic status.	0.5778711187292664
Longitudinal studies are warranted to further elucidate the predictive value of these diagnostic concepts.	0.46968053932068227
In a retrospective study, we evaluated 180 patients treated for painful spondylolisthesis with combined anterior and posterior fusion.	0.7086309777242963
Group I included 90 patients treated by anterior fusion with the transperitoneal approach.	0.5651301605472075
Group II included 90 patients operated on with a retroperitoneal approach.	0.4504268529916435

On the basis of our findings, we recommend the transperitoneal approach for anterior interbody fusion L5 to S1 or L4 to S1.	0.580799924901392
Coronary surgery is at this point of time the standard therapy of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis.	0.7287125059958232
Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is performed only in bail out situations.	0.5292574362825161
The number of publications of successful percutaneous intervention in unprotected left main coronary stenosis is increasing because of increasing use of stents and ticlopidine to avoid stent-thrombosis.	0.4522200838397491
Within the context of an extensive study of electroconvulsive therapy at the Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Bonn 15 patients suffering from therapy-resistent Major depression (DSM III-R) were examined with a detailed psychometric test battery, containing memory- and nonmemory tests.	0.6439621349662287
The test battery had been applied short time before, during and after the treatment with 10 ECT applied unilateral over the nondominant hemisphere.	0.6306104230561156
Comparing the test performances before and 1-2 days after the end of the series there were only few remarkable changes: a significant decrease was diagnosed exclusively in 30 min delayed recall of verbal items, while visual short-term memory and visual-constructive performance showed a significant improvement (in spite of unilateral stimulation on the right side).	0.7830203468519575
None of the other cognitive functions inclusively speed of performances and reaction time was detracted short time after the end of the ECT-treatment, instead all the measures improved albeit not significantly.	0.4931131937789
Between responders to treatment (50% improvement in HAMD) and non-responders no significant differences neither before nor after the treatment were detected.	0.6922985206952578
The non-responders had in nearly all of the tests some better (but not significantly) results despite being older than the group of responders.	0.5941982991865795
In this study we assessed the drawing abilities in 37 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.	0.5568071336089521
Drawing abilities (drawing: house, flower, clock; Rey-Osterrieth figure; copying: MMST-figure; Rey-Osterrieth figure) were quantified with different rating schemes and related to other neuropsychological assessments.	0.3895250313797588
All patients underwent a positron emission tomography with 18-FDG.	0.6718507869453799
Drawing performance was highly correlated with severity of dementia - expressed in MMST scores (r=0.78; p<0.0001) - with visuo-spatial short-term memory (r=-0.69; p=0.001), and writing abilities (r=-0.77; p<0.0001).	0.5532514841499806

Since the first dermatological outpatient clinic was started in Dresden in 1869, it has seen the practice of dermatology in the broadest sense, with scientific research activity and innovation.	0.663816895779216
The good working relationship between the dermatologists in private practice and those in the clinics has been the main factor in this successful development.	0.5998556174307721
The traditional background of the following sectors is highlighted: outpatient clinic, X-ray and UV ligth treatment, allergology and occupational dermatology, psychosomatic dermatology, dermatosurgery, and phlebology.	0.5965487275077811
A 12-year-old girl from Zaire with Aids (CDC: P2 D1) presented with a generalized molluscum contagiosum infection.	0.5954193639327451
She had suffered from systemic cryptococcosis and from cryptosporidiosis several months before admission.	0.3896433889203
While molluscum contagiosum infection is usually a self-limiting disease in immunocompetent persons, a fulminant appearance and persistence of giant mollusca occurs with advanced immunodeficiency.	0.5091427697479435
Histological and immunohistological examinations showed a severe diminution of Langerhans and T cell populations that might enhance the dissemination of the infection.	0.43226888913454153
Molluscum-like lesions of cryptococci have been described, and cutaneous cryptococcosis is the main condition to be considered in the differential diagnosis.	0.7196806271823534
Further differential diagnoses should include American and African histoplasmosis, and the cutaneous manifestations of mycobacterial infections, of toxoplasmosis and of Pneumocystis carinii infection.	0.6522214641345817
The search for vascular structures in skin tumors by incident light microscopy has revealed a surprisingly high proportion of vascularized tumours.	0.4224405159134825
Characteristic vascular patterns, in some cases highly tumour-specific, have been defined.	0.7118820138261064
The vascular structure is a valuable feature for characterization and differentiation of skin tumours, especially for amelanotic malignant melanoma.	0.6912862312174384
We propose a flowchart procedure for analysis and diagnosis of skin tumours using incident light microscopy, which appears to be valuable for advanced image analytic techniques.	0.5313250879474252
Introduction: The treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects still represents a problem that has not yet been solved satisfactorily.	0.639942095979682
Current methods used to cover defects in the knee joint are osteochondral cylinder transplantation (OCT) and autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT).	0.6079415019541196
Methods: With a prospective clinical investigation, at the time being with 2-year results, we have examined ACT in comparison to OCT in 20 patients with regard to clinical and histomorphological (histology, immunohistochemistry, RES) outcome.	0.8665038869167785
Results: We found equally good results with both methods in Lysholm, Meyers and Tegner Activity Scores.	0.6242903342254514
Histomorphologic evaluation of biopsies obtained by arthroscopy after ACT showed a defect filling in all cases, mainly with fibrous cartilage, while localized areas of hyalinelike regenerative cartilage were documented near the base.We did not see any histomorphologically visible change in the transplants after OCT.	0.5055945151278888
Conclusion: At the time we prefer OCT instead of ACT given the correct indication.	0.6565997660234548

Repeated EEG recordings revealed no epileptic discharges.	0.2190846632876009
In both patients, duplex ultrasonography revealed an occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) contralateral to the side of the RIMs.	0.5429419868889024
Blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to ICA occlusion were reduced and vasomotor reactivity to hypercapnia was absent.	0.42412463726561517
After elevation of blood pressure both patients became asymptomatic.	0.524519008326842
We suggest that in patients with episodes of RIMs, Doppler sonography and tests of cerebral vascular reserve capacity should be performed to search for a hemodynamic origin of these symptoms.	0.6833872890668116

Retrospectively analyzing the history of three patients with gastrointesinal stromal tumors (GIST) treated over a period of 1 year in the surgical department of our regional hospital, we tried to answer the following questions: using the current recommendations in the literature, how are the macro- and microscopic features and clinical presentation to be interpreted?	0.7293042411605535
Which prognostic and therapeutic conclusions should we draw, giving special consideration to practice-orientated management of such cases.	0.5134904313756263
The patients were 65, 75 and 88 years old respectively, and in each case the GIST manifested as recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.	0.7797986549558252
During surgical treatment four gastric tumors ranging in cross section between 2.5 and 8 cm were found.	0.5690606423586109
The GIST diagnosis was established after light microscopic and immunohistochemical examinations.	0.379125232230497
Going through the current literature, a large number of structural and immunohistochemical criteria have come to light for determining its classification and potential malignancy.	0.5180567433384531
On the other hand, very few subsequent recommendations concerning therapy and prognosis can be found and follow-up recomendations are almost unavailable.	0.5517684645524915
We conclude that GISTs are difficult to diagnose because of their locality and that their clinical behavior is uncertain.	0.511080922343516
The potential malignancy, on the other hand, requires a well-founded diagnostic procedure in the form of the best possible pre-therapeutic staging.	0.5907280062242964
Furthermore, initially radical surgical treatment should be adopted and the follow-up should be adapted to the risk involved.	0.6278987443106171
The latter is arbitrary and further clinical studies are required.	0.5157004994484221
In animal experiments and clinical studies liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons improves gas exchange and breathing mechanics in damaged lungs.	0.5536094472534328
According to the data on the toxicity of perfluorcarbons available today, it could potentially be applied in infants in the future, too.	0.8586026641603293
However, the catalogue of unanswered questions is still too long for controlled clinical phase III studies to be conducted.	0.47484635673166803
Further possible applications of liquid ventilation offer hope of solving open therapeutic and diagnostic problems.	0.415034025308479
Taking into account all available data about liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons today, we still do not know whether it is a real alternative method for respiratory support; however, further studies to investigate whether the method is an alternative strategy for artificial ventilation in neonates are justified.	0.6991134159563046
The role of elective lymph node dissection (ELND) in primary malignant melanoma is controversial.	0.6005210374049269
Our purpose was to evaluate the benefit of ELND regarding survival and disease-free survival in malignant melanoma of the trunk and extremities.	0.7022272694832501
By matched-pair analysis, 375 patients treated by wide local excision (WLE) plus ELND were compared to 375 patients treated by WLE only.	0.548791580239473
There was no difference in survival between the two treatment groups; however, the disease-free interval was significantly higher in the collective treated by WLE plus ELND (P<0.05).	0.7101972602830828
Increased survival rates were noted for intermediate tumor thickness of 1.51-4.0 mm for the WLE+ELND group although the difference was not significant (P=0.14), and disease-free survival was significantly improved in this group (P<0.001).	0.7594415238780718
ELND elicited a higher benefit in male patients with intermediate thickness melanoma.	0.37874982148505015
Our results confirm the findings of several studies that ELND improves the outcome after primary treament of malignant melanoma of intermediate tumor thickness.	0.6608438722236017
7 patients (5 female, 2 male; age:  22-81 years; average age=58,1 J) with recurrent necrotizing ANCA-negative, non leucocytoclastic vasculitis, were enrolled into this study.	0.7717344201491178
Disease was resistant to prior conservative therapy, and therefore patients received high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) - (dose: 1,0 g/kg body weight daily dose 0,25 g/kg body weight over 4 consecutive days).	0.6569742832983628
All patients responded rapidly to this therapeutic regimen.	0.32729164752232043
Specifically immediate pain relief was striking.	0.43878340996833004
Complete clearance of disease was observed in 5 out of 7 patients within 6 months while receiving IVIG (0,5 g/kg body weight) every 4 weeks for one year.	0.7602193630381211
In 2 out of 5 patients ulceration and vasculitis healed completly and therapy could be stopped after 6 months.	0.449959693684566
In one patient treatment had to be discontinued due to decreasing kidney function.	0.5346440755479117
The data presented demonstrate that IVIG is an  effective and valuable therapeutic modality in treatment of severe vasculitis resistant to conventional therapy.	0.5263248901402254
However consideration of costs, effectiveness and possible side effects is needed for this therapeutic regime.	0.5869143974433368
After orthopedic surgery, skeletal muscle will enter the rehabilitation process in weakened condition due to the following characteristics.	0.5462603451932958
After use of a tourniquet during surgery, the muscle suffers ischemia/reperfusion damage due to oxidative stress, resulting in structural impairment.	0.5753917198841152
The resulting immobilization leads to muscular atrophy, with a loss of calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress being of etiological significance.	0.5279644971899619
Degeneration of muscle fibers as well as regeneration occurs in muscle while still immobilized.	0.3925988123462745
After remobilization, the muscle has impaired functional capacity and frequently shows disturbances in its innervation pattern.	0.48635008038123095
High mechanical loading should therefore be avoided, and electrical stimulation may be applied to facilitate recovery.	0.600196950904904
Considering the role of oxygen radicals, supplementation with vitamin E appears generally recommendable.	0.38714557241386155
The timing of surgery and postoperative radiotherapy - especially if combined with chemotherapy - has been a subject of interest over the past years.	0.9418978998751251
This analysis was based on a literature review of mostly retrospective publications.	0.6258024000479845
Data concerning the interval between surgery and radiotherapy were correlated with the locoregional control, incidence of distant metastases and prognosis of breast cancer, lung carcinoma, and head and neck carcinomas.	0.7268783901842931
The reviewed data did not show a clear relationship of the time interval between surgery and start of radiotherapy and locoregional control.	0.6254007987812221
However, evaluation of the data was difficult, because in most publications, retrospective analyses were performed and other prognostically more relevant parameters may influence locoregional control stronger than the time interval.	0.6630075884558753
In patients with head and neck carcinomas, there is a negative effect of time interval between surgery and radiotherapy on local control if unfavorable factors exist, i. e., close surgical margins, unfavorable pathohistological parameters and low radiation dose.	0.5784104102671536
In patients with breast cancer who do not receive chemotherapy, there are inconsistent reports in the literature.	0.6366658265614163
If additional chemotherapy is necessary, the sequence surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy seems adequate.	0.6158377234109373
Although some data suggest that delaying the initiation of radiotherapy due to chemotherapy may increase the risk or local recurrences, there may, on the other hand, be an increased likelihood of systemic metastases, if radiotherapy is applied before chemotherapy.	0.6626736248707044
Concerning lung cancer, only one retrospective analysis exists suggesting a better survival of patients with an interval of more than 36 days between surgery and radiotherapy as compared to patients with a shorter interval.	0.827643962842846

With the baseline calculation of 64,000 DM per patient and 104 polytrauma treated per year in the Berlin Virchow Clinic, 6.66 million DM primary costs must be spent for treatment.	0.5372822148071346
The total annual costs of this center are nearly 24 million DM for emergency cases and 7 million DM fixed costs per year, for a trauma center level I.	0.49564335423788525
In Europe the distribution of trauma center levels I or II is sufficient and can be specified with 1 center per 1 million inhabitants.	0.4975548794318112
Nevertheless, the european air medical service could support more intensive use of these central trauma institutions.	0.5139318164514156
This was shown by comparing the number of polytrauma patients and the number of trauma centers.	0.6030944583068428
Less then half of these patients are treated in levels I or II trauma centers.	0.7375463966752334
The financial pressure on the health system and the rising quality must lead to better utilization of trauma centers.	0.5217508732515254
To meet this goal a annual treatment rate of 300-400 polytrauma patients should be aimed at.	0.38113923188966425
The claim of the American College of Surgeons that a trauma surgeon should treat 50 severely injured patients per year would then be possible.	0.4439912582975527
This report is a retrospective investigation of the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies given to adults in a private practice setting and furthermore a study of the stability of the therapeutic results achieved.	0.6493647713442412
In the spring of 1997 a total of 16 bioenergetic therapists (6 of them medical doctors and 10 psychologists), all members of the Swiss Society of Bioenergetic Therapists (SGBAT), provided upon request a number of data on 319 patients who had terminated their therapies after a minimum of 20 sessions 6 months to 6 years earlier.	0.5895830522721112
A self-evaluating questionnaire was then constructed, to be answered anonymously, and was sent to these 319 patients in late summer 1997; 290 of them could be reached and 142 (49%) returned it.	0.6443178854369498
The questionnaire contained questions related to the psychic and physical condition, to interpersonal and psychosomatic problems, and to the effect of body work on physical consciousness, cognitive insights and changes of the quality of life.	0.8103383281506508
Regarding the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies, the statistical analysis of the returned questionnaires showed significant positive changes in all areas questioned.	0.5780381214354274
Bioenergetic body work was judged to be important and indispensable by about half of the patients.	0.5948406133125139
Regarding the stability of the therapeutic result, 107 patients indicated a stable or even improved condition.	0.4937122155383015
Of the 35 patients who since termination of the bioenergetic therapy had chosen to undergo further therapy, 16 opted again for a body-oriented psychotherapy.	0.5125147330977821
Purpose: In a clinical study 35 patients with intracranial aneurysms were examined using CT-angiography, MR-angiography (MRA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA).	0.76380293734956

In situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR in situ hybridization are new diagnostic tools in dermatopathology.	0.5251465647129433
These techniques can combine the sensitivity of PCR with the advantage of in situ hybridization to localize specific cellular structures.	0.5912142614199991
With optical control of the PCR reaction product in these techniques, false-positive results due to contamination can be minimized.	0.6260316305127901
Several working protocols have been established which allow detection of DNA and RNA sequences in a rapid and reproducible manner.	0.542706416186875
Two different methods have been established to detect the amplification product, the indirect PCR in situ hybridization (PCRisHyb), and the direct in situ PCR (is PCR).	0.708799299854149
An easy and reproducible method for PCRisHyb and isPCR in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue is described and the two techniques are compared.	0.4669950675674923
Using both isPCR and PCRisHyb, the amplification product can be visualized with an optimal morphological preservation of the tissue.	0.5458422114355647
Indirect PCRisHyb showed a slightly higher specificity whereas direct isPCR was the quicker, easier and less expensive method.	0.3099372525349328
In a randomized study 30 patients with chronic stationary psoriasis were treated with 3 different topical schemes.	0.6990568727120519

After premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam, anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone (4-12 mg/kg) and maintained with O2/N2O and isoflurane (1.5-2 vol.%).	0.6865030233538202
Six minutes after thiopentone, the patients received the relaxant, and after further 6 min 0.1-0.2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated.	0.8845120690695015
Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored every minute.	0.6610109061748038
Blood samples for histamine were withdrawn 5 min prior 3 and 5 min after each drug administration (thiopentone, relaxants).	0.46339735821972367
Plasma histamine was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 pg/ml.	0.6197771806906336
Additionally, serum tryptase was measured by RIA at baseline (-10 and  -1 min) and 15 and 60 min after the relaxant administration.	1.0092916121639934
Levels for histamine >1000 pg/ml and for tryptase >2 µg/ml were considered significant.	0.6495278961509823
Cutaneous signs of histamine release were documented.	0.3160263971193375
Results: Ten patients showed a positive prick-test reaction.	0.6315695928679543
Only after thiopentone some cutaneous signs (4 flush, 1 erythema) of histamine release were observed.	0.7563401246997717
There were no cutaneous signs of histamine release correlating with cardiovascular changes.	0.4917354384536286
Analysis of the blood samples demonstrated no significant increase in the histamine level in all three groups.	0.8616026935384716
Only in 1 patient was a significant higher histamine level (1133 pg/ml) measured 5 min after 5xED95 cisatracurium.	0.6787977634975523
All measurements of serum tryptase were within the physiological limits.	0.4424458635763212
Discussion: In this study, with the particular time course of drug administration, neither cisatracurium nor vecuronium increased plasma histamine levels.	0.7213619019446599
Only after 5xED95 cisatracurium was 1 elevated histamine level documented after 5 min.	0.3386463381468444
In several studies increased histamine levels have been described, but without clinical manifestations.	0.7645133517150551
It is known that cutaneous signs can occur without increased plasma histamine levels due to the structural heterogeneity of mast cells.	0.5381411625426338
The cutaneous reactions in this study were caused by thiopentone.	0.7545186567679252
The tryptase values were within normal limits even in the patient with histamine release.	0.6895887704921709
No relationship between the positive results in the prick test and the incidence of cutaneous reactions and/or histamine release for drugs used in the induction of anaesthesia was observed.	0.7469857624603096

After femorofemoral coupling on the heart-lung machine, right ventricular relieve was rapidly attained.	0.4490733644210686
During the course of a 3-hour period of extracorporal circulation, the initially significantly elevated pulmonary pressures were able to be reduced to moderate levels.	0.6840551540016315
Correspondingly, right ventricular recovery could be echocardiographically determined.	0.3780608186531084
As a consequence of this development, and after preclusion the presence of any large thrombotic masses which might have been situated in the pulmonary trunk, it was possible to forego thoracotomy and embolectomy.	0.7449824093049637
This procedure allowed, on the one hand, the avoidance of imminent right ventricular failure through the use of the heart-lung machine.	0.6990589845022835
On the other, due to the lessening of the degree of surgical intervention, the risk of grave hemorrhaging as a result of concurrent thrombolytic therapy could be minimalized.	0.6215386206597043

Performing a prospective study, we exactly documented effects and side effects during the induction phase of SIT using a purified aqueous yellow jacket venom preparation in 20 patients allergic to yellow jacket venom (clinical degree II-IV).	0.535810118497975
Indication for the therapy was defined individually for each patient and was based on a score incorporating the following criteria: a) clinical symptoms, b) in-vivo- and in-vitro testing, c) risk of re-sting.	0.9385050441892977
SIT was started under inpatient conditions following a standardized 8 day protocol.	0.31273560650051785
At the end of the induction phase all patients tolerated the maintenance dose of 100 µg of yellow jacket venom without complications even though all showed local side effects (threshold doses 0.01-10 µg, median value 0.2 µg).	0.6041097375751261
40% of all patients showed subjective side effects (median value of threshold dose 30 µg, range 0.2-60 µg) and 30% showed objective side effects (median value of threshold dose 55 µg, range 20-80 µg); however, all side effects were clinically mild.	0.8476091248972636
When objective systemic side effects were seen, the cumulative daily dose was 39-210 µg (median value 135 µg), exceeding 100 µg in 83% of patients.	0.692903947252209
Our prospective study confirmed that the chosen protocol for SIT is effective in inducing tolerance to the venom preparation.	0.4549111157333896
However, using a purified aqueous yellow jacket preparation did not result in reduction of side effects.	0.5200585942728227
A 76 year old patient with actinic reticuloid was treated with Cyclosporin A.	0.5664548027326605
11 months after beginning the immunosuppressive therapy, he developed lymphoedema and livid nodular skin lesions of the right leg, which histologically showed Kaposi's sarcoma.	0.7028435498955322
After stopping the Cyclosporin A and intralesional therapy with Interferon alpha, no regression of the Kaposi sarcoma could be seen.	0.5542468494740198
The characteristics of Kaposi sarcoma arising during immunosuppressive therapy and the differences in incidence, risk groups and distribution pattern compared to the classic sporadic and the AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma will be described.	0.6282464575129634
The development of Kaposi sarcoma during immunosuppressive therapy for actinic reticuloid has not been previously described.	0.4948189762858321
This analysis was undertaken to review the outcome and toxicity of postoperative adjuvant therapy for Stage II and III rectal cancer.	0.6093890047110154
We reviewed 112 patients treated with radiotherapy (44 patients) and radiochemotherapy (68 patients) after potentially curative (R0) surgery for rectal cancer (UICC Stages II and III), between 1983 and 1994 at the University Clinic of Würzburg.	0.7535044995698104
Median radiation dose was 56 Gy (range: 45 to 66 Gy).	0.5003429352279625
Chemotherapy consisted of 4 to 6 courses of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (420 mg/m2/d) and leucovorin (200 mg/m2/d).	0.7475645027809933
Median follow-up was 37 months.	0.6592060800732462
The overall survival was 84% for patients with UICC Stage II and 45% for patients with UICC Stage III disease (p = 0.0045).	0.7319021859622146
There were no statistically significant differences between patients treated with radiochemotherapy vs radiotherapy in terms of 5-year survival (63% after radiochemotherapy vs 53% after radiotherapy, p = 0.16), relapse-free survival (52% vs 50%) and locoregional control (69% vs 67%).	0.829655914104353
UICC Stage III disease was associated with high failure rates (40% pelvic recurrences and 53% distant metastases).	0.547703141117582
There was a statistically significant difference in terms of the incidence of distant metastases between the 2 treatment modalities for patients with Stage III disease (49% 5-year probability for developing distant metastases after radiochemotherapy vs 66% after radiotherapy, p = 0.047).	0.6767890810232793
In a multivariate analysis, the addition of chemotherapy, lymph node stage and grading were independent prognostic factors for survival.	0.6108142584277934
Severe late toxicity was documented in 5% of treated patients.	0.6515998164804907
Prognosis of patients with UICC Stage III rectal cancer remains poor after "standard" surgery followed by postoperative adjuvant treatment (pelvic radiotherapy and bolus intravenous injection of 5-FU and leucovorin).	0.599875676842871
Major efforts should be made in order to improve prognosis for these patients, including optimization of surgical treatment and systemic treatment.	0.8261791239601831
More effective multimodality treatment strategies should be investigated in prospective randomized trials.	0.5334431374661491
Andy Warhol underwent dermabrasion in 1957 because of a nasal skin lesion, which is best diagnosed as a rhinophyma on the basis of the available biographical literature.	0.6521013643014425
Throughout his creative life, the artist worked on different aspects of plastic surgery especially in the nasal area.	0.596062664684737
As one of the founders of Pop-Art, Warhol left essential marks on the modern society and influenced our standards of aesthetic shapes.	0.36044218122712063
Objective: The clinical activity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not reliably reflected by laboratory measures.	0.7662646449894325
Proteolytic enzymes involved in the cascade of joint destruction are potentially useful parameters to monitor the extent of joint inflammation in RA.	0.5102392415620676
This study compares the validity of two classes of proteolytic enzymes, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and lysosomal cysteine proteinases (cathepsin B, H, and L) as well as their respective inhibitors to serve as parameters of RA disease activity.	0.5911231136351247
A 47 year old male patient with Miller-Fisher-syndrome did not respond to treatment with plasmapheresis and intravenous high dose 7 S immune globulins.	0.5091348282799407
Only cerebrospinal fluid pheresis, administered as final alternative, lead to definite improvement and cure.	0.4156422062853011
Invasive selective coronary angiography as a clinical method is about 40 years old.	0.46244086335052403
This article surveying this period, written by an R&D engineer, deals with four parts: first the situation before 1965 is touched upon.	0.38644844136794065
For the time after 1965 the second and third parts describe the development of the procedure and of the technique with special reference to the work of Prof. Dr. K. Bachmann and to the facility, which in 1967 was designed together with him and further developed.	0.7844800853548034
K. Bachmann had already taken up the method of invasive coronary angiography around 1965, which makes him one of the group of pioneering users who developed the fundamentals of the procedure and led coronary angiography to its self-evident use today.	0.624570573174106
The first clinical application of high resolution image intensifiers with the input screen produced from evaporated cesium iodide in 1971 appears as one of the highlights of the continuous improvements of the facility.	0.45075720061238594
The fourth part of the article sketches the status of today and, considering the new methods using MRI, EBCT as well as CT, it predicts that the invasive coronary angiography will remain an indispensable method at least for the medium-term future.	0.6362090908541153
Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole) have revolutionized the therapy of peptic disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract and reduced the indications for surgical intervention.	0.6980018093144248
These substances inhibit the H+/K+-ATPase in the parietal cells with an acid suppressing potency that is much higher than that of H2-receptor-antagonists.	0.4484712914073031
The first proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, has been introduced ten years ago.	0.5569390657491444
Since then, sufficient experience with this drug in children has accumulated.	0.6306447188329332
Omeprazole is released for children aged one year or older.	0.32089635304956743
A new formulation makes the drug applicable in tube fed patients.	0.3079393448083713
The main indications for the use of omeprazole are endoscopically verified peptic esophagitis and gastric and duodenal ulcerations of different etiologies.	0.4275144782589967
In the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-infection a sufficient acid suppression is essential for the efficacy of the antibiotics.	0.5264770741043399
The recommended pediatric dose ranges between 0,7-1,4 mg/kg bodyweight and day.	0.6663626885704519
However, some children with ulcerative esophagitis may need daily doses up to 3.5 mg/kg.	0.7398116611369957
Healing of the esophageal mucosa should be monitored by endoscopy.	0.4651621135034191
After remission, doses can often be reduced for maintenance therapy.	0.4039374567972382
Side effects are rare and do not seem to increase with higher doses.	0.75974868994251
Possibly interactions with other medications, i.e.	0.263021500321916
antiepileptic drugs, may occur.	0.5888354902691555
A long-term therapy lasting more than 6 months in a child should be monitored by an experienced pediatric gastroenterologist.	0.6893836875470186
Nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTI) are frequent complications after transurethral prostatectomy.	0.6252579262293116
The resection itself, postoperative catheterization and the prostate are possible causes of these infections.	0.6389277989938255
In this prospective study we investigated the influence of bacterial prostatic colonization on the incidence of postoperative urinary tract infections and inflammatory complications.	0.6552267759893745
In 78 patients we observed in 42 cases (53,8%) a bacterial prostatitis.	0.727104573956791
In 14 patients (17,9%) we found nosocomial UTI's and in 12 patients (15,4%) inflammatory complications.	0.814367795124906
The incidence of postoperative UTI's increase significantly in patients with positive prostate-cultures.	0.6688248700995556
On the other hand we only found corresponding prostate- and postoperative urine-cultures in less than 50%.	0.7422165556079384
The presented data are not sufficient to conclude the kind of relevance of bacterial prostatic colonization for postoperative UTI's in transurethral prostatectomy.	0.5184636696058929
Under consideration of the significant increase of nosocomial UTI's in patients with positive prostate cultures a perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis seems to be required in general.	0.6559532935181482
Apnea, bradycardia and oxygen desaturation in infants with very low birth weight are common findings in neonatal intensive care.	0.4657558513032543
The prognostic significance of their intensity and frequency and the principles of treatment, however, are controversial.	0.5513280067754234
The universal aim, in order to prevent traumatization of the lung, is to ventilate infants with very low birth weight for as short a time as possible.	0.6250602060734262
Therefore drugs such as theophylline, aminophylline and doxapram and techniques such as nasal CPAP have been studied in our neonatal intensive care unit.	0.44408461067337873
In these studies we developed a treatment algorithm.	0.5535741149207245
In two clinically controlled studies performed successively we first proved that sodium acetate theophylline given intravenously has the same efficacy as aminophylline.	0.34643891611237854
As aminophylline has more side effects, sodium acetate theophylline is preferable.	0.30164299637907643
Bradycardia, apnea and desaturation were registered from the print-out of the monitoring system's trend analysis and in a polysomnographic study during steady-state conditions.	0.5134182728497663
In a historical study we were able to prove that intravenous injection of aminophylline is superior to oral administration.	0.487274498171122
We demonstrated equal efficacy of doxapram and theophylline; however, doxapram reduced the rate of apnea significantly more during the first 3 days of treatment.	0.5284721401958639
In a retrospective study we analyzed the efficacy of nasal CPAP as the third level of treatment.	0.6101588428347821
The rate of bradycardia, apnea and desaturation was significantly reduced during CPAP and respiratory rate and oxygenation improved.	0.45243025951323074
The algorithm developed established theophylline with 5 mg/ kg as bolus infusion over 20 min, followed by 3 mg/kg BID as the first line of treatment.	0.5151015351461171
Only if a quick therapeutic response was desirable was doxapram the first drug of choice (indication >=4 bradycardias below 80/min, 4 desaturations below 80% or 2 apneas of >=20 s over 2 h).	0.5605457989399052
After 48 h an additional second drug was added if we could still observe >=3 apneas, 15 bradycardias or 15 desaturations over this period.	0.4009473864991329
Nasal CPAP was introduced as the third line of treatment.	0.458607466551874
With this treatment algorithm we were able to reduce the time on a respirator of infants with very low birth weight from 4.9 to 3.4 days (P<0.01).	0.6415713195741166
An evaluation of similar treatment algorithms in multi-institutional studies is indicated.	0.3354642066453221
Background: Associations between back pain, the quality of sleep and the quality of matresses have not yet been investigated systematically.	0.6354649612790272
Methods: At check-out we asked 265 consecutive guests of a trade fair hotel about the subjective quality of sleep in the previous night.	0.4966915951233748
Nine rooms had been equipped with new mattresses of three different qualities and prices, but this was kept blind to the hotel staff and the guests.	0.5627926019802684
Sleep quality was assessed on an analog scale between 1 (very good) and 5 (very bad) and was analyzed in comparison to the remaining 8-year old mattresses of the hotel, but also with respect to social (e.g.	0.8696435608918032
private vs. professional reason for the stay) as well as personal (e.g.	0.4354960407708037
previous experience with low back and sleep complaints) characteristics of the guests.	0.5116069076716488
Results: The three qualities of the mattresses correlated significantly and positively with the perceived quality of sleep, but the difference to the "old" mattresses was most pronounced for those guests who were staying overnight for professional reasons, or who frequently were suffering from low back pain or sleep disturbances.	0.6099045653756788
Conclusion: At least for chronic sufferers from back pain and sleep problems, the association between sleep quality and quality of the mattress is significant.	0.8181783390459438
Body oriented psychotherapy is used nowadays in in-patient and out-patient settings, individually or in groups, alone or combined with other methods.	0.5536252928134208
These methods have special importance in patients whose body feeling is reduced, who are restricted in their emotions, or for those who are difficult to reach because of resistances of character.	0.6716789376713617
Short examples are given as an introduction to the methods used often the most nowadays, reference is made to other procedures.	0.5503700275657861
The connection of emotions to the vegetative and autonomic nervous system inter alia and the link between emotional and physical processes which is especially strong to the beginning of life and which combines with the specifically experienced form of interaction and has psychobiological consequences are mentioned as active factors.	0.4857289897262694
In later development, the body and certain parts of the body acquire a symbolical meaning too, which is important for the therapy.	0.8330862512494984
The relationship of body oriented procedures to verbal psychotherapy and especially to psychoanalysis shall also be discussed.	0.4841532252508457
Approaches to empirical research are pointed out.	0.28570010582750527
Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare diseases that occur in relation to cancer.	0.4922624226153728
Supporting the hypothesis of an autoimmune mechanism, specific antineuronal antibodies have sometimes been detected.	0.5128443812122194
The current possibilities for treatment are limited.	0.47161532112980226
A female patient, aged 57, suffering from a breast cancer, developed a severe paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome and limbic encephalitis within a few weeks.	0.5876391034232351
It is possible that the impressive partial remission that occurred during the ensuing 6 months was not due to therapy.	0.612505217065166
Although the patient was still bound to a wheelchair, discharge from hospital was possible because she was still able to perform daily tasks by herself.	0.5721028284354217
A recurrence of the cerebellar symptoms with mild alterations of mental status occurred 2 months later but again showed a good remission.	0.5152880074180671
The outcome in 163 patients treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in the department for vascular and thoracic surgery since its institution 5 years ago is investigated.	0.6196116584883627
Some 142 patients underwent operative aneurysm repair; 21 (13%) were excluded from operation.	0.6714223125755018
In 108 (66%) an elective procedure was performed, an emergency operation for rupture 34 times (21%).	0.670668265185428
In 16% of cases one or both renal arteries or the inferior mesenteric or the internal iliac artery were reimplanted.	0.684834189616619
For further analysis the patients were split in three groups: elective group 1, symptomatic group 2, ruptured group 3.	0.6256390253633651
Significant differences were found in the aneurysmal diameter, distribution of gender (128 M, 14 F), renal artery involvement, or concomitant peripheral arteriosclerosis as well as for the risk factors tobacco smoking, hyperlipidemia, renal insufficiency, and the presence of multiple risk factors.	0.7629622222553318
Group 1 had a significantly higher preoperative hospital stay than group 2; whereas the intensive care stay was significantly longer in group 3 than in the other two groups.	0.6896044263727439
Sixty-four percent of patients had no, 11% had more than one complication.	0.8689822143044258
Mortality was 0 in groups 1 and 2, but 35.3% in group 3.	0.9125710164206253
The most frequent complication in groups 1 and 2 was pneumonia (13.9%) followed by cardiac complications (4.6%), and renal insufficiency (3.7%).	0.8193096674995105
In group 3 respiratory insufficiency demonstrated the highest incidence (23.5%), followed by renal insufficiency (21%) and pneumonia (17.6%).	0.6765215238912741
No patient of the nonoperated group suffered an aneurysm rupture; aneurysm diameters, except one, did not increase during the follow-up period.	0.559779776993583
Of the 130 operated and discharged patients 31 died; in no case was death related to the operative procedure.	0.5311963811487909
No important complications were observed during the follow-up of 37.2 +/- 17.9 months.	0.7370619971711218
Furthermore, the results are compared with those of the literature.	1.1514994870170563
Based on their observations the authors conclude that this retrospective quality check was rather awkward and involved giving partly incomplete data for lack of a prospective evaluation.	0.49262269408885695
Nevertheless, the results compared well with those in the literature and were satisfactory.	1.0111597178315053
We report on a 32-year-old male patient with advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), who had severe candidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract.	0.6246165526498324
Treatment with fluconazole, 200 mg/day, was introduced.	0.6736731210412575
After oral intake of fluconazole over 5 months itraconazole 200 mg/day was given for 1 month.	0.5108512578110243
However, fungal infection still persisted.	0.3356256062785631
The antifungal activity of fluconazole, itraconazole and ketoconazole against Candida albicans was evaluated by means of the microdilution test by determining the 90% inhibitory concentrations of each drugs.	0.5112490725121581
A high minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was detected for fluconazole (50 µg/ml) revealing fluconazole resistance.	0.6335460708331847
The susceptibility to itraconazole was borderline (MIC 0.125 µg/ml) and that to ketoconazole was markedly lowered (MIC 0.25 µg/ml).	0.5315083986851308
Plasma levels of itraconazole were also found to be lowered.	0.5947528406786347
In HIV patients the gastrointestinal absorption of azole derivatives is often reduced.	0.382354864326078
Therefore, the clinical resistance of Candida albicans to itraconazole can be explained by reduced susceptibility after azole therapy and also by the decreased absorption of the drug in HIV patients.	0.716473240656815
Patients suffering from soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities may sometimes require vascular reconstruction to remove the tumor with adequate margins of clearance.	0.5171053428221011
Besides this, recurrent lymph node metastases are often affixed to neighboring vessels.	0.5111389527837914
MRI and angiography represent the adequate diagnostic procedures.	0.36070747553468124
Vessel-invasive sarcoma can hardly be treated by surgical resection with curative intent alone.	0.5307483971766787
If there is doubt about invasion of arteries and veins, the vessels should be resected and replaced by autologous vein graft.	0.5881275865760933
Soft tissue coverage is of major importance, particularly if prosthetic grafts are used or the resection is within an area of irradiated tissue.	0.5803640631185446
After radical resection and combined modality therapy, one can expect local recurrence rates similar to those without vessel invasion.	0.5930801729820598
To achieve this goal, surgical oncologists, vascular surgeons and plastic surgeons must work together.	0.6084102854302631
Today, amputation can hardly be justified even in vessel-invasive soft tissue tumors.	0.4903605496206899
The study aimed to evaluate whether superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation (SHFJV) is a useful tool in intensive care medicine to ventilate patients with pulmonary insufficiency.	0.7699712202974303

The dermatology clinic in Krefeld has treated a wide range of patients since its founding in 1845.	0.3714681587171419
Nowadays the spectrum consists of allergology, occupational dermatology, phototherapy, dermatosurgery, phlebology and proctology as well as special clinics for andrology, sexually transmitted diseases and patients with HIV-infection.	0.4345595806636767
Background: Dapiprazole hydrochloride is an alpha-1-adrenergic inhibitor that anticipates the mydriatic effect of phenylephrine in dilator muscle receptors in a competitive way.	0.4207211083347477
The aim of this study was to determine for which indications for mydriasis pupil dilation by phenylephrine alone is sufficient and if the reversal by dapiprazole is convenient and the practical.	0.49036536643183337
The Quality Assurance programmes of the social security insurance authorities are presented from the point of view of psychosomatic rehabilitation.	0.6593057748551552
This presentation attempts to introduce aspects of both Quality Assurance and Quality Management into the field of medical rehabilitation.	0.5017130318471759
The consequences of the programme for political order are emphasized.	0.35959925575532437
The special features of the individual programme objectives are elaborated.	0.6258832483186774
In addition, the importance of each of these objectives for psychosomatic rehabilitation is examined.	0.5169963642145072
This field will inevitably have to adopt concepts of time and resource optimization.	0.3990123654578256
For many years the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome has been on the top of medical articles about the intensive care patient.	0.5599756878676936
While severity scores deal with the 1st ICU day physiology, the organ dysfunction systems aim to take in account the duration type and severity of physiologic disturbances during the ICU stay.	0.5055098175704442
Most of the published systems have been created by a panel of experts, giving to each dysfunction a number of points, usually 1 to 4, according to the severity.	0.6757927278452374
Only 2 systems are different: the MODS of Marshall et al.	0.4014950317289931
and the Logistic Organ Dysfunction LOD system of Le Gall et al., both published recently (1995 and 1996).	0.5314551268852662
They differ from the others because first they were created either from a literature review (MDOS) or from a logistic regression (LOD), and secondly, because neither takes into account the therapy.	0.6451125812394832
Besides, the LOD system, when used on the 1st ICU day, has statistical qualities which are very promising.	0.7462145279207442
The LOD system is now used each consecutive day on septic patients in an European multicenter study.	0.36429946334129043
The relationsship between the growth of tumors and the expression of the protooncogen Bcl-2 could be shown in epithelial tumors.	0.6346566503100908
A bcl-2 expression leads to a prolonged cell survival due to an inhibition of apoptosis.	0.5796628681870911
The potential meaning of bcl-2 expression in mesenchymal tumors remains still unknown.	0.4084021326729728
The fact, that the heterogenous group of osteosarkoma is not sufficiently characterized at present, suggested to investigate the bcl-2 expression in osteosarcoma.	0.6082100580976179
Thus, immunohistochemistry was used to analyze 47 specimens of different osteosarcomas of 36 patients.	0.6375965262804965
Sixteen cases (46 %) showed a strong expression of bcl-2 and 13 cases (35 %) were moderately positiv for bcl-2.	0.7663058497844751
Seven cases (19 %) were negative for bcl-2.	0.7265666561784675
The heterogenous, negative up to strong expression of bcl-2 yield clues, that the Bcl-2 controlled regulation of programmed cell death could be an important factor of cellular kinetics.	0.6224911889565724
Additionally the cellular proliferationrate was determined with the monoklonal antibody MIB 1, directed against the Ki-67 epitop.	0.45576889907636314

Ablative oncologic surgery has always been closely linked with plastic and reconstructive surgery, rendering radical surgical interventions possible without disfiguring patients.	0.4125647865676736
The development of facial reconstructive surgery proceeded in stages, in the first instance as secondary reconstruction using tube pedicled flaps.	0.6522076102900031
The change to the concept of primary reconstruction occurred via arterialized skin flaps and myocutaneous flaps to the widely accepted and performed free tissue transfer.	0.4557351203142271
Free bone grafting, inaugurated earlier and still representing the majority of bone grafting, has been supplemented for certain reconstructive purposes by free vascularized bone transfer from various donor sites.	0.45266295392255623
Although the five-year-survival rate of carcinoma of the oral cavity has remained unchanged in the past 30 years, distinctive improvements in tumor surgery can be recorded.	0.7420433113530182
This is primarily based on improved diagnostics such as modern imaging techniques and the refinement of surgical techniques.	0.5778026121959926
The DÖSAK has worked out distinctive guidelines for effective ablative oncologic surgery.	0.30626097232603955
Surgical approaches offering wide exposure and carrying low morbidity play a decisive role in radical resections.	0.3481232984146635
For this reason, midfacial degloving offers an essential improvement for the resection of midface tumors, especially from an aesthetic point of view.	0.5970178121488324
Tumors situated deep behind the viscerocranium at the skull base can be clearly exposed either through a lateral approach following a temporary osteotomy of the mandibular ramus or a transmandibular, transmaxillar, or transfacial approach with minimal morbidity.	0.4475782153150891
Concerning the concept of neck dissection, radical techniques are more and more abandoned in favor of a more conservative procedure.	0.5430612615930699
Actual inquiries concerning present surgical procedures as to the surgical strategy in "No-neck" or marginal and segmental resection in mandibular adherent carcinomas demand scientific clarification.	0.5458398505675154
Laser treatment of various skin changes has become common clinical practice in recent years.	0.5649589219954689
Due to its physical properties, the CO2 laser is particularly well suited for cutting and ablating tissue.	0.6505665996091435
The high absorption of its wavelength in water (=10600 nm) is responsible for its low penetration depth in biological tissue.	0.5016583062461739
Shortening the exposure time minimizes thermal side effects, such as carbonization and coagulation.	0.290098414513302
This effect can be lessened with the SilkTouch scanner, since the focussed laser beam is moved over a defined area by rapidly rotating mirrors.	0.5296824524636411
This enables a controlled and reliable removal of various dermal lesions.	0.3764929708824724

Acute spinal cord injury affects more than 3000 individuals per year with predominantly young people between 15 and 20 years of age being involved.	0.4278925621563544
Analysis of the modern emergency management has revealed that the prognosis of acute spinal trauma depends decisively on the initial treatment at the accident site as well as good acute emergency care.	0.6491047636736668
Therefore, there is the urgent need to brain the medical staff so that injuries are diagnosed correctly and appropriate treatment be performed.	0.5792784082344644
The first hours after the accident are decisive, because injuries due to the primary and especially secondary trauma are difficult to correct later.	0.6871212803401078
Besides the fate of the individual patient, the care provider has to be aware of the high economic impact caused by intensive care, long lasting rehabilitation, as well as post rehabilitative care.	0.74409607071774
Chronic or repeated stress can induce a damage of neurons, expecially in hippocampus, by which the degree of damage differs in various species.	0.5119706777821735
Sapolski has reported that there is a correlation between hippocampal degeneration, disturbed feed-back reaction, and hypersecretion of glucocorticoids.	0.4939998735898896

Introduction: The treatment of soft tissue defects of the foot and ankle region remains a challenge, because special anatomical and physiological properties have to be considered.	0.7058364035755734
Patients and methods: The data of 52 patients, who were treated between 1994 and 1998, were analyzed.	0.9378754039432332
48 % were posttraumatic defects and were located in the weight bearing zone in 37 %.	0.6556559956904195
Results: Fifty-nine procedures were used, including skin transplantation in 16 patients, local flaps in 3 cases, regional flaps in 14 cases, and microvascular procedures in 17 cases.	0.7216781554503524
Amputation was required in 4 patients.	0.5571137958440155
The overall success rate was 92 %.	0.4216747796896727
Complications occurred in 18 patients.	0.4346777361709743

The conventional multichannel electroencephalogram is quite inconvenient for long-term monitoring in the operating theatre or intensive care unit.	0.4956715842331248
Recording of the EEG would be easier if a small number of channels was sufficient.	0.37074155586539803
Aiming at reduction of channels, leads from different regions of the scalp were analysed visually and with regard to their spectral content.	0.5510721002416467
APC resistance was first discovered in 1993.	0.3083310470187668
It is the most frequent cause of thrombophilia in Europe and North America.	0.6851826295394393
In more than 90% of cases, the underlying cause of APC resistance is a single point mutation in the factor V gene.	0.7238983861330077
Heterozygous patients have a between five- and ten-fold higher risk of developing venous thrombosis, while in homozygous patients the risk is increased up to between 50- and 100-fold.	0.7921201985104174
Where there is a previous history of thrombosis, a careful investigation of the coagulation system, in particular a determination of the APC ratio, is recommended prior to surgery.	0.8545556038569724
In patients with APC resistance, a body-weight-specific thrombosis prophylaxis with heparin is recommended.	0.6750254947764116
Heterozygous patients only need anticoagulation when additional risk conditions are present, while homozygous patients with thromboembolic disease should be anticoagulated over a long period of time.	0.5410315410666242
Primary varicosis of the saphenous system should be treated promptly by surgery to minimize the additional risk of thrombotic complications.	0.5327267936402601
Pyomyositis is an acute bacterial infection with abscess formation in the skeletal muscles mostly due to Staphylococcus aureus.	0.4726658116220401
The disease is found more often in males.	0.6984101463008274
Since the patients symptoms and the clinical and laboratory findings are relatively unspecific, the clinical diagnosis of pyomyositis can present difficulties.	0.9847433462922505
Furthermore, cases of pyomyositis are rare in non-tropical countries and some physicians may not be familiar with it.	0.6061906531582337
If not diagnosed and treated properly, pyomyositis can lead to sepsis and death.	0.4422360519105405
Although the pathogenesis of the disease has not yet been clarified, some predisposing factors of forensic interest are well known: (trivial) trauma or vigorous exercise of the affected skeletal muscles, small potentially "septic" foci in other tissues or internal organs and a preexisting immunodeficiency, e. g. in diabetes mellitus, intravenous drug abusers or individuals suffering from HIV.	0.6495334785576914
Three cases of "non-tropical" pyomyositis with fatal outcome are presented and the literature on the subject is reviewed with special reference to epidemiological and etiological factors, taking forensic aspects, histomorphologic findings and the problems of post-mortem diagnosis of pyomyositis into consideration.	0.6901437141514376
Aim of the study: The etiology of persistent crying during early infancy has been only insufficiently elucidated.	0.5721596059909437
Based upon recent data from the "Munich Interdisciplinary Research and Intervention Program (MIRIP)", this paper shall discuss and challenge well known explanatory models.	0.5790285434076561
In addition, novel approaches of intervention shall be presented.	0.32280465355624977
Because tumour cell invasion is a three-dimensional process involving tumour cells as well as stromal cells, tumour invasion models should include equivalents of both compartments in a spatially defined organisation.	0.5035068363726195
Aims: Evaluation of differentiation and invasive potential in relation to basement membrane (BM) formation of new human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines under the influence of fibromatosis fibroblasts in a 3D co-culture system (collagen type I/fibroblast-containing matrix).	0.47569926870044393
Material and methods: OSCC cell lines were established and cultured on collagen type I matrix with and without the inclusion of fibro-/myofibroblasts derived from nodular palmar fibromatosis).	0.472906959679533
Evaluation of invasion was done by conventional H & E staining after paraffin embedding; immunohistochemistry was performed for cytokeratins (MNF 116), involucrin (Sy5), vimentin (V9), collagen type IV (CIV22), laminin (1-chain, 4C7), and Ki-67 (MIB1); and electron microscopy followed.	0.6032590268608764
Results: The OSCC cell lines PE/CA-PJ15, PE/CA-PJ34, PE/CA-PJ41 were invasive exclusively on gels containing fibroblasts with stratification of the multilayerd OSCC cell coat and polarised expression of cytokeratin and involucrin.	0.3672914888184112
There was no evidence for BM, either by immunohistochemistry or by electron microscopy, although OSCC are immunohistochemically positive for collagen type IV and laminin in the 2D cell culture.	0.5816689652239607
There were no differences in proliferative activity of the gels with and without fibroblasts.	0.5809323143687041
Conclusions: Carcinoma cell invasion depends on the presence of fibroblasts in the gel indicating the important role of tumor stromal fibro-/myofibroblasts during carcinomic invasion.	0.5295413660360901
The absence of a BM does not, per se, imply an invasive tumour growth.	0.4464519515532766
Moreover, stratification and terminanl differentiation of epithelial tumour cells occur independently of a structural BM.	0.40214035388772124
Interfragmentary movement and size of the fracture gap influence fracture healing.	0.6133288289753199
Limited movements promote callus formation and may result in increased mechanical stability.	0.4585375409693977
Although larger movements still promote callus formation, the bony consolidation of the fracture is hampered.	0.7062240802084447
Fracture healing is also hampered if the size of the fracture gap is too large.	0.6500556143250196
A combination of large movement and large gap bears the risk of non-union.	0.5032151659246877
Therefore, having in mind a minimally invasive surgical approach, one should strive for good reduction of the fracture ends and flexible yet stable osteosynthesis.	0.6626055978764337
Dynamization of the fracture by enabling axial movement will close the fracture gap, stimulate tissue differentiation and possibly accelerate the healing process.	0.51452781500963
External mechanical stimulation, however, has not been shown to effectively enhance the healing process under flexible fixation or in load-bearing patients.	0.61165788598238
Although ketamine has been in clinical use for 3 decades, the neuropharmacological basis of its analgesic, anaesthetic, sympathomimetic, and psychotomimetic effects is still a subject of controversial discussion and intensive investigational efforts.	0.62586049310661
In recent years, however, new experimental approaches to its effects on the cellular and molecular level and the availability of pure ketamine enantiomers contributed substantially to the understanding of its complex neuropharmacology.	0.56101745748382
This article reviews the current knowledge of ketamine effects on ligand-operated and voltage-operated transmembrane ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors, transmitter uptake, and the NO-cGMP system in neurons.	0.5861642996339089
With regard to its potential clinical relevance and supposed relative role among the complex mechanisms involved in pain perception, analgesia, anaesthesia, and psychotomimesis, the contributions of recent experimental and clinical findings to the identification of major target sites of ketamine are summarised.	0.6455227988136274
In contrast to the uncertainty surrounding the potential role of opioid receptors, there is now considerable evidence that NMDA antagonism is a central mechanism that contributes to the amnesic, analgesic, anaesthetic, and psychotomimetic as well as the neuroprotective actions of ketamine.	0.6116093582064096
Moreover, the involvement of non-NMDA glutamate receptors, muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic transmission, interactions with 5-HT receptors, and L-Type Ca2+ channels may account for some of its anaesthetic and neuroprotective properties.	0.6071639282575619
There is undoubtedly a need for a safe disinfection method of optical instruments used by ENT specialists.	0.5084987366033764
So far, a standard method that sufficiently covers the risk of infection for patients and medical staff alike while serving the need of practicability in daily routine has not been established.	0.7160037598439636
Therefore, in the ENT departments of the hospitals of Mannheim, Kaiserslautern, and Tübingen, studies on the disinfection of rigid optical instruments without working channel were performed between February 1999 and May 1999.	0.6576771381873664
Instruments were wiped either with an aldehyde or alcohol (ethanol 80%) and germs were detected by quantitative swab cultures.	0.5092444948917959
As discussed in the article, disinfection with ethanol proved to be at least equally efficient if not better than disinfection with aldehyde.	0.4891472157465441
Therefore, it fully serves the requirements of a safe method for disinfection optical instruments without working channels.	0.5819831984241916
White piedra is a rare hair infection of man and certain animals, caused by the widespread Trichosporon fungi.	0.5957458746954795
The infection is characterized clinically by whitish, soft and easily removable coating of the hair shafts; however, the shafts may be destroyed by the pathogens invading at localized points.	0.5057122443077338
While all body hair may be affected, the pubic hair is most frequently affected.	0.5720054222390145
This paper is the first report genital white piedra in a 34-year-old Central European man.	0.614074249528851
In all, 22 cases have been described world-wide in young men ranging in age from 20 to 40 years.	0.6184706615827785
Only 2 men, aged 42 and 53 years, do not fall in this range.	0.4788416240173689
Recently, a major African study disclosed this disease in women for the first time.	0.61918239421201
In moderate latitudes, however, this infection appears to occur almost exclusively in young men.	0.5165013094797504
In open fractures the rate of infected non-union defects has in recent years decreased due to the increased primary application of external fixation.	0.5963649707438812
In spite of this positive state of affairs the condition is still encountered often enough to warrant specific treatment strategies and techniques.	0.4692972035818182
In the treatment of infected pseudarthroses the general principles of osteitis treatment are applied.	0.38951798498152
This includes radical excision of infected pseudarthrotic bone and of the diseased surrounding soft tissue, provides mechanical stability in the non-union area and requires effective local treatment of the infection in combination with systemic, target-specific and temporary well-defined antibiotic therapy as well as procedures to improve local circulation.	0.6634785678470548
The incorporation of autogenous bone transplants in defects appears to depend on close contact between the transplant and the vascularized receiving site and on the quantity of the transplanted osseous material.	0.5119181855236322
A promising alternative method of dealing with extensive bone defects is osteogenesis produced by callus distraction; therefore special attention is given to Ilizarov's ring fixation system.	0.46789788527041176
Unstable scar formation demands local muscular flaps or microvascularized free flap transfer, which seems to be superior to other methods.	0.5426131694990934
Aim of the study: Using phantom studies, a dedicated low-field MR system with 0.2 T and a whole-body MR-scanner with 1.0 T were compared.	0.8130985525767139
Many different mechanisms contribute to the etiopathogenesis of the so-called diabetic foot syndrome.	0.4651745579570763
Among chronic complications, the diabetic foot syndrome is one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization.	0.6515943508719063
The relative risk of diabetic patients requiring an amputation is up to 45 times greater than in normal subjects.	0.38112230650104867
Sensory neuropathy, ischemia, and infection are the principal pathogenetic factors in the diabetic foot syndrome.	0.5596316537618401
In most cases, a painless trauma is the initial condition that leads to an ulcer.	0.5926783664404804
In this article, an overview of the different causes, clinical manifestations, and treatment options for a multidisciplinary team are discussed.	0.8765944173737814
Lung resection offers the best prospect of long-term survival in patients with nonmetastatic pulmonary neoplasia.	0.57878494664034
In view of the dismal prognosis of unresected bronchial cancer, surgical resection should be encouraged even in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary function.	0.6160229106074292
Accurate estimation of the postoperative cardiopulmonary function is therefore desirable to avoid (a) refusal of potentially curative treatment and (b) severe postoperative disability.	0.5820451878191604
The origins of postresection morbidity and mortality are multifactorial.	0.462731773285061
Thus, no single pulmonary function test or hemodynamic measurement can accurately and reliably predict postoperative cardiorespiratory complications.	0.46881608933723784
Criteria of functional operability should be based on percent of predicted value, so that patient's age, sex, and height will be taken into consideration.	0.5756654498351101
Exercise testing offers the advantage that both pulmonary and cardiac risk can be evaluated simultaneously.	0.5172440228225953
The high predictive value of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in assessing postoperative morbidity and mortality is established.	0.644981101520875
The calculation of predicted postoperative lung function (ppo) is of importance.	0.6306227090942931
The postoperative values for the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1-ppo), the transfer factor (TL,CO-ppo), and VO2max-ppo can be predicted by using the same formula.	0.6338650756217105
Patients with nearly normal lung function (FEV1, TL,CO > 75 % predicted) and no concomitant cardiac disease can undergo lung resection right up to pneumonectomy without further diagnostic procedures.	0.6622283164984556
In the others, FEV1-ppo and TL,CO-ppo should be estimated first by taking into account the number of segments to be resected.	0.5104083465999285
Patients with values < 30 % predicted are usually regarded as being inoperable, whereas values > 40 % predicted qualify for resection without the need for further diagnostics.	0.7479088375357661
VO2max < 10 ml/kg/min or < 40 % predicted are prohibitive for surgery.	0.739893021103834
If VO2max is > 20 ml/kg/min or > 75 % predicted, functional operability without limitation is given.	0.7019878532459852
For those cases where diagnostic uncertainty still remains, FEV1-ppo, TL,CO-ppo, and VO2max-ppo can be calculated by means of quantitative lung scans.	0.4928560222461529
Patients with either FEV1-ppo and TL,CO-ppo < 30 % predicted or VO2max-ppo < 8 ml/kg/min or < 35 % predicted are deemed inoperable.	0.7052348543418121
The treatment of acute of Achilles tendon rupture experienced a dynamic development in the last ten years.	0.6797222271122796
Decisive for this development was the application of MRI and above all the ultrasonography in the diagnostics of the pathological changes and injuries of tendons.	0.6149124721405596
The question of ruptue morphology as well as different courses of healing could be now evaluated objectively.	0.4490205670866945
These advances led consequently to new modalities in treatment concepts and rehabilitation protocols.	0.3778814211122715
The decisive input for improvements of the outcome results and particularly the shortening of the rehabilitation period came with introduction of the early functional treatment in contrast to immobilizing plaster treatment.	0.6050247162425929
In a prospective randomized study (1987-1989) at the Trauma Dept.	0.8701959740682097
of the Hannover Medical School could show no statistical differences comparing functional non-operative with functional operative therapy with a special therapy boot (Variostabil/Adidas).	0.4914943162217889
The crucial criteria for therapy selection results from the sonografically measured position of the tendon stumps in plantar flexion (20  °).	0.6029398251684531
With complete adaptation of the tendons' ends surgical treatment does not achieve better results than non-operative functional treatment in term of tendon healing and functional outcome.	0.5045938774827925
Regarding the current therapeutic standards each method has is advantages and disadvantages.	0.4259404162289483
Both, the operative and non-operative functional treatment enable a stable tendon healing with a low risk of rerupture (1-2 %).	0.7846458921663144
Meanwhile there is consensus for early functional aftertreatment of the operated Achilles' tendons.	0.40869189665069283
There seems to be a trend towards non-operative functional treatment in cases of adaquate sonografical findings, or to minimal invasive surgical techniques.	0.7578033458298766
Based on a case report, we offer brief guidelines on the perioperative management of patients with Sleep-Apnea-Syndrome (SAS) who present with a high incidence of a difficult airway and a high risk of respiratory depression during the perioperative period.	0.8072392777835531
A 39 year old male patient with a body mass index of 34,22 kg/m2 and receiving continuous-positive-airway-pressure- (CPAP) therapy for known SAS was scheduled for elective plastic surgery.	0.6996478454285864
After induction of anaesthesia and direct laryngoscopy no adequate airway could be established and the patient became hypoxic, hypercapnic and developed hypotension and bradycardia.	0.6148794048439666
With the use of a laryngeal mask airway the patient was stabilized and did not show neurologic sequale after immediate awakening.	0.6535920342079918
The following fiberoptic intubation of the awake patient, still showing tendency of upper airway obstruction, confirmed the difficult anatomical structures.	0.5161875594110021
The subsequent general anesthesia was uneventful.	0.27751004963343195
The patient received CPAP therapy and was monitored during the first postoperative night in the Intensive Care Unit.	0.6541440630125503

He was advised to have regional anaesthesia or planned fiberoptic intubation, where possible, in the case of further anesthetic intervention.	0.6154994498037817
SAS has major implications for the anaesthesiologist and whenever patients exhibiting the high risk factors (obesity, male sex, history of intense snoring, impaired daytime performance, nonrefreshing daytime naps) are presented for surgery this condition should be considered.	0.6181131665060671
Elective surgery should be postponed until after adequate examination and treatment when necessary.	0.4310594978131364
Patients with SAS should always be suspected of having cardiopulmonary dysfunctions such as hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmia or cor pulmonale.	0.44784722696008217
It is most important to avoid sedative premedication, to initiate CPAP therapy preoperatively, to encourage regional anaesthesia if possible and to ensure close monitoring over the complete perioperative period.	0.6289984728505285
Planned fiberoptic intubation, preferably with surgical personnel available for an emergency airway, is a safe method for the induction of anaesthesia.	0.7615708775045886
Postoperatively, patients are at high risk from respiratory depression, even in the awake state.	0.8610086438665946
Postoperative opioid analgesia, no matter what route, should only be given under close monitoring.	0.6146867596643798
Independently of regional or general anaesthesia there is an increased risk of respiratory depression in the middle of the first postoperative week, suspected to be caused by the catching up on lost REM-sleep, due to shifts in the normal sleep pattern during the first postoperative days.	0.7308477986226601
Life style measures (weight reduction and control, reduction of total fat calories to <30% of total calories, modification of fat intake to increased monounsaturated vegetable fat, increased intake of dietary fibers, increased physical activity, controlled stress relaxation) are the basis of longterm therapy of coronary heart disease.	0.662808717610858

In the present review we describe our experience with debridement in necrotizing pancreatitis, with particular emphasis on the indications for surgery and the outcome in patients with infected and sterile necrosis.	0.9198495606129315
Within 7 years 64 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis underwent surgery with a median preoperative APACHE II score of 9.	0.5479866579851989
The indications for surgery were either proven infection or persistence of symptoms.	0.5280118028739943
Thirty-six patients were found to have infected necrosis, while 28 patients had sterile necrosis.	0.7349204314277574
There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding pre- and postoperative parameters.	0.8588260991834064
The surgical technique involved a blunt necrosectomy followed by closed packing with Penrose drains.	0.4167691193934495
This technique produced the lowest reported mortality of 6.2 % with a reoperation rate of only 17 %, demonstrating that even with sterile necrosis surgical management can be carried out safely.	0.6967907320378034
The incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction (MI) is proportional to the incidence of myocardial ischaemic episodes.	0.6278184194977561

The absorption of large volumes of irrigation fluid is a major problem in transurethral prostatic surgery (TUR-P).	0.5415901138854734
Various indicators have been tested to monitor fluid absorption with regard to continuous registration and sufficient accuracy.	0.406651373893654
The volumetric fluid balance is not suitable as a routine method because of its inaccuracy.	0.5857082789719252
Easily accessible parameters are unspecific because of surgical bleeding (haematocrit [Hct]), or are interfered with by physiological counter-regulatory actions (serum sodium [Na] concentration).	0.42284500748952286
In 1986 Hulten et al.	0.16384534449127222
suggested adding 2% ethanol to the irrigation fluid as a marker and investigated it intermittently in the expired air with an alcohol-test appliance.	0.5004654854943943
In a prospective clinical study of 17 patients undergoing TUR-P under spinal anaesthesia, expiratory concentrations of alcohol that was added to the irrigation fluid (2% ethanol in Purisole, Fresenius, Bad Homburg) were monitored.	0.7575716337286709
Gas was continuously sampled from the nasopharynx through a nasal cannula and the ethanol concentration was measured using a modified diverting anaesthetic gas monitor (Normac, Datex, Helsinki) that allows continuous as well as early detection of the absorbed irrigation fluid with reliable accuracy for clinical use.	0.5111020032479673
In addition, at intervals of 10 minutes we measured blood alcohol, endtidal alcohol (Alcotest 7110, Drauml;ger, Lübeck), haematocrit, serum Na concentration, and blood gases.	0.557288379682918
Sixty-eight measurements were obtained from the 17 patients.	0.4975998092303048
As shown in other studies, serum Na (r2 = 0.68) and Hct (r2 = 0.39) correlated poorly with the irrigation fluid as determined by serum alcohol levels.	0.5143091304303377
In contrast, the expiratory alcohol measurements with the alcotest 7110 (r2 = 0.93) and Normac devices (r2 = 0.85) were closely related.	0.6203870380298178
Continuous monitoring of the expiratory alcohol concentration with a Normac monitor closely reflects blood alcohol concentrations, and may hence serve as a useful semiquantitative monitor of irrigation fluid absorption during TUR-P.	0.5646275310234004
Between 1986 and 1996, 21 patients had a tibiocalcanear arthrodesis.	0.5736751156814102
Indications for surgery were in all cases either osteomyelitis or avascular necrosis of the talus.	0.7143046983325599
External stabilisation was used in 17 patients due to severe soft tissue damage or extensive infection of the talus, internal screw fixation was used in four patients.	0.8472449380569682
There were eight complications in seven patients, one patient had a below the knee amputation.	0.7664199235763228
The leg length discrepancies after resection of the talus was equalised in four cases with callus distraction using an Ilisarov ring fixator.	0.6879806816194131
Follow up evaluation was available in 18 patients after an average of 38 months (12-86 mo.).	0.6637200163882099
There were no infectious recurrenies during the follow up period and a solid fusion was achieved in all patients that were followed.	0.861804142372878
According to a modified Kitaoka score, results were excellent and good in 12 of the 18patients.	0.697769884711338
External stabilisation, especially the Ilisarov ring fixator is the primary method of treatment in cases with severe infection or soft tissue damage.	0.8875920796453038
Intraoperative autotransfusion (MAT), preoperative autologous blood donation, and preoperative normovolaemic haemodilution are three different methods to avoid homologous blood transfusion during surgical procedures.	0.5101867042866031
The controversial use of MAT via cell saver in tumour surgery as well as contamination of the operative field with urine illustrate the particular difficulties of autologous blood transfusion in connection with radical prostatectomy.	0.5271521303953616
We investigated changes in the osmotic resistance of the retransfused red blood cells (RBC), bacterial contamination, changes in coagulation parameters, and the presence of tumour cells.	0.6397495494399049
Orbital pseudotumor is a nonspecific inflammatory process of unknown etiology that can be divided histopathologically into three basic types: granulomatous, lymphoid, and sclerosing.	0.6259114913767033
Between 1995 and 1998, 12 patients with pseudotumor orbitae were treated in the ENT Department of the University of Saarland.	0.7128955013739496
Histopathological examination showed granulomatous type of pseudotumor in six, lymphoid in three, and sclerosing in three patients.	0.5957152864796119
In seven cases the pseudotumor orbitae were medially located and in four cases laterally.	0.4645624923656724
In one patient nearly all orbital structures were infiltrated.	0.4839810506372387
A number of different mapping systems have been published for the lymph-node staging in lung cancer.	0.5849319685884141
The use of a reproducible map is an essential prerequisite for correct determination of the TNM status and comparing the surgical results.	0.6914309370859191
In order to evaluate the current status of lymph-node mapping and lymph-node dissection in Germany, we performed a mail survey involving 90 hospitals performing operations for lung cancer.	0.6521806733122186
Responses were obtained from 61 (67.7 %) hospitals.	0.6285051775001231
Currently, the majority of the departments (43 %) use the German staging system (according to the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Thorax-, Herz- und Gefäßchirurgie/Pneumologie), 23 % lymph-node mapping according to Naruke, and 25 % an individual description of the resected lymph nodes.	0.7160708181288965
The number of resected lymph nodes is reported in 75 % of the departments, the quotient of involved/not involved lymph nodes in 33 %.	0.7847211395315095
Mediastinal lymph-node sampling guided by the intraoperative aspect of lymph nodes is performed in 59 % of the departments.	0.7377100935043203
A systematic mediastinal "en-bloc" resection is accomplished in 41 %.	0.4445720861638054
The results of this survey represent the current status of lymph-node mapping and lymphadenectomy in lung cancer in Germany and might be useful for the development of a uniform staging system.	0.7092989436459147
In a 4-year period two right-sided empyemas occurred following a total of 39 pneumonectomies for lung cancer.	0.6052337931925676
In another case pneumonectomy was performed for left-sided lung cancer with concomitant empyema as an emergency procedure in a patient referred from an outside hospital.	0.6567080419806784
Empyema was treated with repeated thoracoscopic debridements and intermittent lavage with polyvinylpyrrolidine-iodine solution and streptocinase/streptodornase.	0.36347647392400484
Three to seven thoracoscopies were required to sterilize the pleural cavity.	0.2661103332455875
After a median follow-up of 14 months all three patients are well and without any evidence of infection.	0.6376012101939684

Injuries to the spine and the spinal cord are an important problem.	0.7508611215229474
In the present paper the application of external transpedicular fixation of the spinal column for surgical treatment of patients in the acute phase of spinal cord injuries is described.	0.989848912475459
The results of treatment obtained in 54 patients in the acute phase are presented.	0.7440840445015391
Decompression of the spinal cord can be accomplished by way of a dorsal approach.	0.6246097088045238

Certain intra-articular fractures of the knee can be managed by arthroscopically assisted reduction and  fixation.	0.6243023356370218
The known benefits of arthroscopy include better visualization of the entire joint, limited dissection, and thorough irrigation.	0.6350005589440202
The purpose of this paper is to present our experience with arthroscopically assisted reduction and fixation of certain intra-articular fractures of the knee.	0.7614120572508452
From May 1995 to November 1997, 34 patients with intra-articular fractures of the knee were treated by arthroscopic reduction and fixation.	0.7546975915931987
We treated 11 patients with tibial plateau fracture type I, II and III (according to J. Schatzker classification), 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the tibial insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament (intercondylar eminence) type II, III and IV (according to Meyers, McKeever and Zariczny classification), two patients with completely dislocated osteochondral flake fractures of the femoral condyle, and one patient with a minimally displaced fracture of the patella.	0.7156166334737811
Postoperatively they were all allowed passive motion exercises.	0.2785763756682368
Patients with avulsion fractures of the ACL and the patient with fracture of the patella were allowed immediate weight bearing, while patients with tibial plateau fractures and osteochondral fractures were allowed weight bearing only after 12 weeks.	0.7462948336618785
Results: Of the 11 tibial plateau fractures, 8 were anatomically reduced, and in 2 the dislocation was less than 2 mm.	0.9597463013917317
No further dislocation of the fragment followed.	0.5542494009798662
All patients but one reported stable knees and they all had a full range of motion at follow-up.	0.43902614346776697
Of the 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the anterior cruciate ligament, 19 were anatomically reduced.	0.5768337703264894
Except in one patient, functional results were excellent (KT1000 was 1.3 mm, average loss of flexion was 2.5 °, loss of extension was 1.3 °).	0.7968435847566252
In two cases of osteochondral fractures of the femoral condyle, reduction was anatomical.	0.8878725934629581
The fractures healed, the patients were free of pain and had full ROM at the follow-up.	0.7764148122967449
The fracture of the patella healed in 4 weeks with full ROM of the knee.	0.5908513524064759
There was one case of aseptic synovitis and no other major complications.	0.673177394797994
Conclusions: Arthroscopic reduction and fixation are technically possible in certain types of intra-articular fractures of the knee.	0.5486438466780832
Provided indications are good, results of arthroscopic treatment are better than in classical surgical treatment through arthrotomy.	0.586747577431793
There is less postoperative morbidity, and hospitalization and total rehabilitation times are shorter.	0.5717857387599815
Some technical hints are presented.	0.19374740476499208
A healthy 38-year-old woman suffered a sudden cardiac arrest 2 days after a vaginal hysterectomy.	0.6714579254456965
Although standard cardiac life support (CPR) was instituted immediately after the event, it was not possible to re-establish a spontaneous circulation for about 40 min.	0.7161713399672821
Systemic intravenous thrombolytic therapy with slow injection of 1.5 million IU urokinase was performed as a final life-maintaining measure because of the high probability that the underlying cause was a pulmonary embolus; 10 min later (after 60 min of ongoing CPR) the patient regained a stable circulation.	0.799161400324713
She survived without neurological deficit in spite of the long duration of CPR.	0.5889932152352093
In 348 patients with an initial diagnosis of rectal carcinoma operated on between 1985 and 1994 we investigated the quality of lymph node dissection, its influence on the perioperative risk and tumor staging.	0.8284778588450338
The same histopathological work-up was carried out in all cases.	0.7676026844062486
Whether resections or extirpations were performed, the number of dissected lymph nodes increased from 5.3 and (1985/1986) to 16.7 and 17.3 (1991/1992) and to 15.8 and 17.3 (1993/1994) respectively.	0.8934764783683551
Neither the type of operation nor the surgeon's experience had a significant influence on the number of lymph nodes dissected.	0.650084659450157
The increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected had no negative effect on the length of the operation, the amount of blood infused during the operation or the perioperative risk.	0.7804991590273658
We found a significant correlation between the number of lymph nodes dissected and the number of lymph node metastases (P = 0.02) and between an increase in UICC stage III (P = 0.005) and pN2 tumors (P = 0.000) and an increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected.	0.8205829766540743
Central lymph node dissection by high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery did not increase the perioperative risk in spite of the fact that in recent years we have observed more patients with multiple diseases.	0.7831066418014606
With the institution of the Protection against infection Act, case definitions will be officially introduced for the routine transmission of notifiable infectious diseases from local health departments to state and national health institutions in Germany for the first time.	0.4755748775834652
Case definitions link the disease entity with a defined description of the disease.	0.4897124321957507
The abstraction thereby required leads to the creation of nosological entities.	0.33831263281477136
The case definitions, which were developed by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) according to the Protection against infection Act, enable the local health departments to assess and categorise reported cases, deaths and laboratory reports of pathogens according to uniform criteria prior to transmission to the RKI via the state health institutions.The quality of surveillance data will be significantly improved, as each reported case/infection will fulfil defined criteria, thereby enabling unclear cases/diagnoses to be separated from those that are confirmed.	0.5597020456775138
Endosseous osseointegrated implants have become an integral part of the treatment scheme for the prosthetic reconstruction and rehabilitation of masticatory function following scientific studies of the reactions between implant and soft and hard tissues.	0.5698176471733571
Furthermore, implants offer good chances for prosthetic rehabilitation in the insufficient bone site, if the extremely atrophic jaw is to be reconstructed by grafting procedures with avascular and vascular grafts, by guided bone regeneration, by distraction osteogenesis, by bone substitutes and in the future by osteoinductive proteins in order to prepare the conditions for implant insertion.	0.6820637560879709
Those reconstruction procedures combined with implants become often necessary, if  complicated hard and soft tissue defects of the skull have to be reconstructed to create the prerequisites for the stabilisation of epitheses or to insert implant-supported devices.	0.5900675895554163
A 58-year-old woman was initially externally diagnosed in 1983 with a presacral mass, which was subsequently treated as an abcess.	0.7184457986774291
Thereafter, the patient experienced recurrent perianal fistulas.	0.867566527418329
Further diagnostic studies revealed a cystic tumor, considered to be an epidermoid cyst, which was located in the inferior pelvis and was consequently removed.	0.7300527342965744
Histologically, cystic scar tissue was found with a highly differentiated adenocarcinoma which measured 4 cm.	0.5933132530931642
Later on, the patient again experienced perianal fistulas originating from a renewed presacral mass.	0.6417437093623282
As a result, an abdominal-perianal rectum extirpation and a partial resection of the sacrum with placement of a descendostomy were done.	0.6098953500365683
Histologically, adenocarcinoma tissue was found at the base of a tail-gut cyst.	0.5653874469426964
One year following her operation, the patient is free from any complaints and relapses.	0.8005535136972434
The tail-gut cyst is a very rare entity which arises from the inadequate involution of the tail-gut during embryonal development.	0.4467466244764852
A malignant transformation occurs in 10 % of the cases.	0.5921861664847339
In the case of recurrent perianal fistulas and cystic masses between the rectum and os sacrum or os coccygeum, a tail-gut cyst should be taken into consideration, the goal being its complete removal.	0.573629320800081
The German Social Law has required quality assurance (QA) procedures since 1989.	0.41100455566770205
The measures must be suitable to allow "comparing investigations".	0.38608927113676705
In 1992 the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine published recommendations for QA in anaesthesia: most problems during an anaesthetic should be documented in a standardised manner, and thus, a list of 63 pitfalls, events, and complications (PECs) and five degrees of severity were defined.	0.6938893295815822
The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of PECs in anaesthesia and to correlate PECs with procedures and preoperative health status.	0.5763159942380244
Using the diary method, the correlation between daily mood and everyday activities is analyzed.	0.5084138222315584
Positive and negative affect were used as indicator of daily mood.	0.5168987556080654
Duration of social activities and resting during the day were used as indicator of daily activities.	0.5421623320366519
A total of 55 elderly persons kept a activity and mood diary for at least 50 days.	0.4647983509858564
The data were analyzed interindividually (using regression analyses) and intraindividually (using time series analyses).	0.7418884723773914
While positive affect and duration of social activities correlate positively in both inter- and intraindividual perspective, there is a relationship between negative affect and duration of rest only in interindividual perspective.	0.5689450463271712
Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.	0.734112800760905
Purpose: Regional hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy or/and radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-seated tumors.	0.5941526177057697
The purpose of the project is the optimization of the therapy using non-invasive, three-dimensional imaging of tissue changes or of the temperature distribution during regional hyperthermia.	0.7105763684431036
The purpose of the Transfusion Law, which came into force on 7 July 1998, is to ensure the supply with safe blood products, to reinforce the confidence in the blood transfusion system, and to support self sufficiency with blood and plasma.	0.7578835526179922
In order to reach this goal, the law regulates the essential reqirements for the adequate collection of blood and blood constituents, as well for safe usage of blood products.	0.6790710614159291
Moreover it lays down rules for look-back procedures, prescribes the collection of data on the epidemiology in donor populations, creates a legal basis for the advisory group 'Arbeitskreis Blut', and fosters the self sufficiency with blood and plasma by several prescriptions.	0.4849354387734959
In the last decades back pain has reached dramatic proportions in industrialized countries.	0.6120343818990378
Disorders of the back are nowadays the leading cause of direct and indirect health care costs.	0.43819136795460306
Accurate prevalence estimates are needed to serve as a basis for health care evaluations.	0.5043250588974563
A review of epidemiologic studies in the general population reveals that back pain has reached a prevalence of 40 % for current pain.	0.7432042612823
7 to 18 % are "frequently", "often", "daily" or "constantly" affected.	0.7473988071675469
75 % of the adult population suffers from back pain during the last year.	0.7235526321646462
80 to 90 % of the adult population in industrialized countries experience back pain ever.	0.5905018386828527
Gender specific differences are only present in severe, chronic forms which are more often experienced by women.	0.5447735736243161
Back pain has a prevalence maximum at 50 to 64 years.	0.4479420456724022
Older persons display lower prevalence estimates.	0.19949729601810567
The prevalence maximum in men is one decade earlier than in women.	0.36558017789121877
There are several potential explanations for this prevalence pattern that are discussed in the article.	0.6238705761811256
Back pain can be classified by location, temporal characteristics, pain intensity and pain history.	0.5897147957240341
Currently, for none of these dimensions generally accepted, uniformly employed and validated definitions are available.	0.5483284413037749
In most of the industrialized countries back pain is one of the most expensive symptoms.	0.6862785881620295
75-90 % of the direct and indirect health care costs were caused by those 5-10 % of patients who are disabled.	0.8584168804906979
As predictors of back pain a history of back pain and job satisfaction play by far a more important role than the extensively studied mechanical factors.	0.4761403565156216

Diagnosis of parasomnias in the sleep laboratory is difficult since the nocturnal behavior reported by the patients often does not show up in the laboratory.	0.5761904639814411
To test the efficacy of sleep deprivation as a tool to provoke somnambulism we investigated ten patients (three women and seven men, mean age 27 +/- 3.4) with somnambulism.	0.7032115025094055
Their standard polysomnographies and videomonitored nocturnal behavior was compared to that of sex- and age-matched controls and to polysomnography and behavior after sleep deprivation.	0.6079987548084244
Patients with parasomnias and controls did not show significant differences in sleep parameters with the exception of longer arousal duration in controls, which was nonsignificant.	0.6803339464418074
In magnetic resonance tomography, patients with parasomnias did not reveal abnormality of the brain that might explain release of nocturnal behavior.	0.7444433178568349
Sleep deprivation led to significantly reduced number of arousals, reduced arousal index, significantly prolonged arousal duration and more stage shifts from all sleep stages (nonsignificant).	0.49867673014027336
Complex behavior during sleep increased under sleep deprivation, whereas sleepwalking did not increase.	0.5297449379776916
The majority of complex behavior during sleep is triggered by stage shifts and not by arousal in the sense of the arousal definition of the American Sleep Disorder Society.	0.5162291614648462
Complex behavior in sleep is stereotypical and nonviolent.	0.27224289405991253
Its complexity seems to depend on the duration and intensity of arousals.	0.5389295193570807
Sleep deprivation can be recommended as an efficacious method of increasing complex behavior in sleep, which is a preliminary stage of sleepwalking.	0.723476687776752
Concerning the underlying pathology it seems to be important to register the quality and duration of stimuli that trigger arousals instead of focusing the number of arousals alone.	0.617367358798965
Introduction: In order to investigate whether operative technique determines the 5-year recurrence and survival rates, we analysed the results obtained by two surgical departments using two different operative techniques.	0.782702446139123
Department A: Removal of the tumour and a number of lymph nodes; department B: En-bloc resection in accordance with the requirements of standardised tumour surgery.	0.5780304518142516
Patients and methods: The surgical results obtained with all patients with colorectal carcinoma operated on between 1984 and 1988 (department A: 152 colon and 53 rectal carcinomas; department B: 124 colon and 177 rectal carcinomas).	0.5674909098066747
Results: The local recurrence rate achieved by department A was signicantly higher (colon carcinoma: department A 25 %; department B 10 %; rectal carcinoma: department A 54 %; department B 16 %).	0.6054951799872483
The 5-year survival rate for colon carcinoma was 65 % in department A, and 66 % in department B, the corresponding figures for rectal carcinoma being 49 % and 72 %, respectively.	0.8507026262408197
Conclusion: The results indicate that carcinoma of the colorectum should be operated on only at an institution that complies with the standards required for surgery of colorectal carcinoma.	0.6415430091888117
Definition of the problem: Ethics consultation is one of the most important ways in which clinical ethicists can support both health-care providers and patients and their relatives in coping with ethical and existential challenges.	0.5604701300232346
The practice of ethics consultation, as performed at the Freiburg University Hospital is described and illustrated by a case report about the problem of treatment termination.	0.7640084107994556

A total of 205 patients suffering from stage I and stage II melanoma were investigated with reference to psychosocial stress, social support and attitude to offers of psychotherapeutic support.	0.5922329310599596
Additional counselling by their dermatologist was considered helpful by 59% of the patients, and interviews with a psychotherapist, by 20%.	0.6750972055756087
Patients who where more anxious about a progression of the cancer and thought they had not been given sufficient information about their illness preferred to seek help from the dermatologist.	0.5026380825012616
Patients who appreciated additional counselling by a psychotherapist were usually those with a poorer prognosis for their melanoma and those on whom psychosocial distress weighed especially heavily and who had less social support.	0.4472782912177492

High-dose UVA1 therapy is an effective treatment of patients with acute atopic dermatitis.	1.0004286727392175
However, some patients do not respond well to this new therapy.	0.5925148586880987
We attempted to further characterize the non-responder population in a retrospective study.	0.42966987899164777
Two closely matched groups of responders (n=20) and non-responders (n=20) were compared.	0.5933642075349196
No significant differences were observed between both groups with respect to the following parameters: skin type, minimal erythema dose, single and cumulative doses of UVA1, and peripheral blood eosinophils.	0.729827695876983
However, non-responders were characterized by a highly elevated atopic score, and by high levels of total IgE and of specific IgE.	0.7259086071384571
Furthermore, colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus occured at higher densities, and intestinal growth of Candida albicans was more frequently observed.	0.7061229042010665
These data indicate that high-dose UVA1 irradiation is not effective in all patients suffering from atopic dermatitis.	0.7218843932125468
We conclude that non-responders with complicating infections might benefit from the combination of high-dose UVA1 therapy and antibiotic or antimycotic treatment.	0.5923576787936855

The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has changed considerably in the last few decades.	0.692864204080817
Clinical observation of mainly unicentric pathogenesis with continuous expansion and subclinical involvement of adjoining regions of lymph nodes has resulted in the introduction of a large-field technique with total nodal irradiation (TNI) or total lymphatic irradiation (TLI).	0.5749382397489456
The introduction of polychemotherapy has led to further improvement in the cure rate and in considerations concerning using both methods and adapting them to the stage and risk.	0.553847883887428
Today the combination of radiation and chemotherapy leads to a reduction in the amount of radiation required in the affected regions (involved field irradiation = IFI).	0.5592443730302511
The German Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was founded by Martin Waßmund in 1951.	0.35267910161526533
One of the main reasons was the need for scientific representation in the council at a medical convention.	0.6588681348584259
The Society, originally composed of 52 members, was first called "The German Society of Maxillofacial Surgery".	0.6040637285921953
In 1972, it extended its title to include the term "oral" ("Mund") and currently comprises 620 members.	0.701307207185802

The patient was treated with calcium and 1,25-dihydroxy-cholecalciferol.	0.7398001614790619
After few days the severe encephalopathy, CT and electroencephalographic changes were completely reversible.	0.49639408227507875
Hereditary disturbances of the parathyroid hormone metabolism are rare diseases.	0.6182723247724607
Hypocalcemia must be included into the differential diagnosis of seizures and brain edema to avoid invasive diagnostic and irrational treatment.	0.5281905134353515
An adequate increase of uterine blood flow throughout gestation is essential for uterine, placental and fetal growth.	0.4305801314049168
Maternal cardiovascular adaptation has to provide the uterine perfusion that is necessary to meet the requirements of the developing and growing fetus by providing transport of nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and the fetus.	0.583965124521192
Thus uterine blood flow is inextricably linked to fetal growth and survival.	0.3940554111998582
Reductions of uterine blood flow can occur under acute or chronic conditions or in a combination of both.	0.4995884962906707
Chronic reductions of uterine blood flow can be observed in pregnancy induced hyertension (PIH), diabetes mellitus in pregnancy and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).	0.5229308690837579
Chronic restrictions in uterine blood flow will elicit a placental and fetal response in the form of growth adaptation to the reduced supply of oxygen and nutrients to the conceptus.	0.4459970980398867
If compensatory growth restriction reaches its limits intrauterine fetal distress can ensue.	0.26364025333814356
In view of a possible Stent implantation, 20 infrarenal abdominal aneurysms obtained consecutively during postmortem examinations were investigated.	0.5714884820916618
Measurements were performed according to toporegional criteria on the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysms as well as on their lengths and diameters.	0.5353993518970682

The following results were obtained: 1.	0.6039885707048057
Depending on the increase in length of the infrarenal abdominal aneurysm, there is an inproportional shortening of the proximal and distal neck.	0.7996250318084024
Up to an aneurysmal length of 4 cm both proximal and distant necks are suitable for stent fixation in all cases.	0.4959533728368289
With lengths of more than 4 cm according to the morphological results, the distal neck is almost always unsuitable for fixation of a simple Tube-Stent.	0.5803291834328661
The proximal neck is suitable for stent fixation in all cases up to an aneurysmal length of 10 cm.	0.5355989699706378
For longer aneurysms, only a quarter of all cases is suitable for stent implantation.	0.8006059152738648
In all cases investigated there were severe arteriosclerotic changes with atheromatous ulcerations and secondary wall-adherent thrombi of up to three centimeter thickness in the aneurysmal and para-aneurysmal regions.	0.48000483729977395
These findings have to be considered, with respect to the transluminal transport of the prosthesis as well as in the regions of the supposed implantation in the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysm with individually variable arteriosclerotic changes of the aorta.	0.8295405537576468
We report on a case of paraganglioma of the cauda equina in a 48-year-old man.	0.5957494021371178
These slow-growing, mostly benign and encapsulated intradural-extramedullar tumours are clinically characterized by lumbago, paraesthesia and motor deficits as well as occasi-onally by incontinence.	0.3980592259232154
Paragangliomas of the cauda equina show monomorphous (main) cells arranged in a typical cell cluster pattern, demonstrating a lobular architecture and a fine net of connective tissue formed by so-called sustentacular cells; some tumours show focal ganglionic differentiation.	0.42136136537775065
Because of their morphological similarity to the more common ependymomas, paragangliomas of the cauda equina are sometimes misdiagnosed so that their incidence is likely to be higher than previously estimated.	0.5128113782218986
Immunohistochemistry findings are positive for neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and other neuronal markers as well as neuropeptides (main cells) and S-100 protein (sustentacular cells) while widely lacking reactivity for GFAP.	0.5615258082371594
Paragangliomas of the cauda equina represent a rare entity, of which only 80 cases have been described in the literature.	0.6803351975404661
Because they only occur sporadically, they are often not included in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the region of the cauda equina.	0.647439134280958
Approximately one out of every three patients with carcinoma of the cervix must be expected to experience a recurrence.	0.6628204319653329
The treatment of such relapses is dependent on the site and extension of the recurrence, the type of primary therapy administered and the patient's general condition.	0.8145098535174378
The limit conditions for the application of the established forms of therapy available - surgical operation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy - are complex and seldom documented by randomized studies.	0.7631008034216603
In general, empiric observations and historical analyses determine the backdrop against which therapy is planned.	0.3258225439165912
The main experiences available are compiled in this paper to give a basis for individual treatment of patients with recurrences.	0.680032649786605
Post-traumatic pyogenic liver abscess is a rare disease.	0.7011079589538909
We present the case of a 38-year-old man with multilocular liver abscess and pleural empyema following blunt abdominal trauma.	0.5690315993845775
The patient had a prodrome lasting 3 months before presenting in our department.	0.5240965605731712
The therapy included partial hepatectomy and pleural drainage.	0.24833831299572692
Clinical signs, diagnosis and possible therapy are discussed in this case report.	0.9228339793588191
The dream of every hospital computer scientist is a completely computerized flow of information in his/her facility: admission, diagnosis, treatment, transfer, and discharge of patients.	0.5587906611610333
However, in developing such general hospital information systems, one runs into the following problems: (1) medical and administrative information systems form a very heterogeneous environment; (2) the structure of medical information is extremely complex, except for certain limited administrative data (admission, transfer, and discharge, for example) needed by the clinic administration.	0.7070738744220554
As a result it is nearly impossible to transfer medical information from one system to another without a loss of data.	0.5547943613927543
One cannot expect a universal solution to this problem within the next few years.	0.4249681861169179
Therefore we present a concept which, based on existing tools, allows communication between medical information systems.	0.5467155591560859
Shave excision of nevi is a technique still under debate.	0.3025575640404628
Speed, simplicity, and the fact that it provides excised material for histologic examination are contrasted with the lack of excision margins and a higher rate of nevus recurrences.	0.6364671698982924
In this study, the pros and cons of shave excision were evaluated.	0.4760549872095955
The congenital dyserythropoietic anemias represent a group of rare inborn errors with ineffective erythropoiesis as the predominant mechanism of anemia.	0.3723374529488441
They are primarily classified into three types on the basis of characteristic abnormalities of the erythroblasts as shown by light and electron microscopy.	0.507325611925724
There are distinct associated features such as pattern of heredity, cell kinetics and abnormalities of the cell membrane.	0.5211201810195922
In addition, patients with apparent CDA of heterogenous phenotype are observed, that cannot be attributed to any of the three types.	0.7073935732579695
Recently variant genes have been localized to different regions on chromosome 15 or 22.	0.34231958230862686
Cases of CDA were reported from many ethnics, in particular in families of meditarranean origin.	0.6324745511245193
Many patients load iron necessitating iron depletion.	0.21403294574316858
Gallstones are a frequent complication and are observed in childhood or adolescence.	0.5374507557917881
Therapeutic measures such as splenectomy, treatment by Interferon  or allogeneic bome marrow transplantation depend on the type and the severity of clinical expression, which shows large variations both within and between affected kindreds.	0.6245754902117289
Sarcopenia is a constant in aging.	0.26047085002318726
Observed over long periods, it can reach 1% per year.	0.7000095322548227
But it is such a tenuous phenomenon that it cannot be observed over short periods at steady state.	0.4171470484712197
The aging phenomenon mainly hits fibers, Type II but on aged muscle thin, normal, and hypertrophic fibers cohabit with sclerosis and fat increases.	0.5249004336672644
Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is characterised by stage-dependent microangiopathy.	0.6382904181732202
With increasing severity there is a decrease in the number of skin capillaries and the oxygen partial pressure.	0.5743383697359444
The cutaneous vascular reserve, which is measured by laser-doppler fluxmetry, is reduced.	0.7474707477571152
Cutaneous microangiopathy is one of the main causes of the trophic disturbances associated with CVI.	0.52015906064981
Low frequency pulsed current improves cutaneous microcirculation and thus nutrition as well as accelerating the formation of granulation tissue.	0.39095659053234877
In a open prospective pilot study, 15 patients suffering from CVI with persistent leg ulcers were treated with low frequency pulsed current (Dermapulse), which is thought to improve particularly the tissue microcirculation.	0.650975600378082
The average age of the patients was 70.3 years and the average duration of ulceration was 79.1 months.	0.9055865280134717
The patients were treated over a period of 38 days.	0.7677919401403902
With this treatmen, 2 ulcers healed completely and 13 showed a reduction of size of on average 63%.	0.5143235116640945
Capillary density increased by 43.5%, while transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure increased by 82.4%.	0.5200689063976006
Electrostimulation is a treatment with few or no side effects.	0.5349159674432835
From 1986 to 1996, we implanted a total of 92 hip arthroplasties (86 cementless, 4 hybrid and 2 cemented) in 65 patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	0.5904845673535817
Of the 89 uncemented cups, 59 were threaded cups (Hofer-Imhof n = 45, Zweymüller n = 7, Mecring n = 5, PM n = 2) and 30 were hemispherical cups of the Harris Galante type I and II.	0.5300007442125514
87 stems were implanted without cement (Zweymüller SL n = 58, Uni n = 16, Schenker n = 9, Zweymüller I n = 4) and 5 with cement.	0.553349979339099
One patient died postoperatively and three (4 implants) within the first year.	0.9386199025941657
To date, one cup of each threaded type had to be revised because of loosening (revision rate approx.	0.49775194988697125
6.8 %); Up to now, three of 87 (approx.	0.7158927891360115
3.4 %) stem revisions (1 x Zweymüller I, 1 x Schenker, 1 x Zweymüller SL) have been undertaken.	0.8875992213070131
Ten patients with twelve hip arthroplasties did not return for follow-up; some of them had a poor general health status.	0.6115504298146608
The clinical and radiological results of the arthroplasties of 52 patients showed a Harris Hip Score averaging 72 after an average of 54 months (min.	0.7938236422136172
Ten patients had minor complaints in the hip region.	0.4559481822487558
79 % of the uncemented implants (70 out of 89 cups, 69 out of 87 stems) were assessed radiologically.	0.675079089988145
Two threaded cups showed slight migration after cancellous bone grafting in the presence of acetabular protrusion that was present in a total of 13 hip joints.	0.4894617763052211
This subsided markedly after filling with cancellous bone and recentering of the hip joint.	0.41388657743089385
Homogeneous incorporation of the bone grafting und thus remodelling of the medial wall was achieved, with the bone graft exhibiting marked reduction.	0.7875869375805581
At final follow-up, approx.	0.3111182255688767
75 % of the cementless cups had complete bone ingrowth without any evidence of radiolucency (type I), approx.	0.5297304411097223

Abstract   The 5th edition of the TNM classification entails a number of changes concerning head and neck tumors.	0.5824055717024471
The division of stage IV tumors into three subcategories marks a significant expansion of the stage grouping procedure.	0.38507743043589343
Methods: In a retrospective study the clinical course of 3247 patients with head and neck carcinomas were comparatively evaluated according to the 4th and 5th editions of the new TNM classification.	0.6992685404157878
In particular it was the aim of the study to test the prognostic relevance of the subdivision of stage IV especially in mucosal cancer.	0.6429494661720234
Results: In classifying the primary tumor the most extensive changes were noted for supraglottic and salivary gland tumors.	0.6115202976989006
On the basis of the 4th edition of the TNM classification the following recurrence-free 5-year survival rates for 3033 cases of mucosal cancer were calculated: stage I 91,0%, stage II 78,6%, stage III 61,4%, stage IV 31,0%.	0.5853746881627608
The calculations based on the 5th edition yielded: stage I 91,0%, stage II 77,2%, stage III 61,2%, stage IVA 32,4%, stage IVB 25,3%, stage IVC 3,6%.	0.611007582746338
Conclusions: The adequacy of the revised stage classification in establishing a prognostic hierarchy was confirmed.	0.42387346642722146
However, a significant prognostic distinction between N2- (stage IVA) and N3-metastasis (stage IVB) could not be found.	0.9224504936417944
The microcirculation is the organ that provides the direct link between blood and tissue, and thereby between the whole organism and the single cell.	0.6625248108700507
Modern microcirculation research in experimental surgery is characterized by the use of high-resolution video fluorescence microscopy and quantitative computer-assisted image analysis coupled with the techniques of molecular biology and transgenic or knock-out gene technology.	0.5327864774852269
These advances should improve knowledge about surgically relevant physiologic and pathophysiologic phenomena at the interface between blood and tissues and help us to understand the initial molecular mechanisms leading to organ dysfunction following inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion, and transplantation.	0.5114571671094826
Legal and moral considerations hinder the introduction of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in Germany.	0.5704617334612921
This article presents and discusses the ethical arguments for and against PGD.	0.5030409749816873
In the autor's view neither the fact that PGD is not a well established technique nor the danger that single-cell-analysis may lead to misdiagnosis convincingly demonstrates that PGD is morally inacceptable.	0.5839954584959645
Inconsistencies in ethical positions which defend abortions but do not accept PGD are highlighted.	0.25784067154930695
The use of arguments dealing with the prediction of negative social consequences after establishing PGD is criticised.	0.41533037711865733
Extensive counselling prior to PGD should be implemented in order to help couples which want to use the new technique to make an autonomous decision.	0.5222568799606087
The SOFA score, a new system for patients with sepsis-related diseases, was introduced in 1994 by the "Working Group on Sepsis-Related Problems of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine."	0.7966216417780708
The purpose of this study was to compare the new SOFA score with the APACHE II and MOD scores.	0.5034116350143705
The data on 874 patients from a surgical intensive care unit in an university hospital were analyzed using commercially available software (SPSS for Windows, Version 7.5.2 and MS Excel '97).	0.6230772774406456
To compare the different scores, receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) - analyses were applied.	0.5999093383352148
The study demonstrated a clear correlation between an elevated SOFA score and the mortality of the patients during their ICU stay (score 0 -> mortality 0 %, 1 -> 3.6 %, 2 -> 22.5 %, 3 -> 86,7 %, respectively r = 0.445; P = 0,01).	0.8578865520044074
The ROC analyses of the APACHE II, the MOD and the SOFA scores were comparable (area under the curve: APACHE II 0.73, MOD 0.77, SOFA 0.71).	0.46406053184143903
In conclusion, the SOFA score is reliable and might be useful in the daily routine of an intensive care unit.	0.6504448595839202
In individual patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), established prognostic factors do not satisfactorily predict clinical outcome.	0.4256810884521826
For the first time we investigated a total of 100 HNSCC by Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) to define chromosomal alterations that are associated with the patients prognosis.	0.6891369332196216
Patients were followed for at latest 4 but at least 2 years after surgery or until death.	0.7363669944113547
During this observation period twenty-nine of them died because of cancer disease.	0.6145780658749914
The Kaplan-Meier method was used plotting survival curves for every single chromosomal alteration as well as every clinico-pathological parameter.	0.40625428741007424
The curves were tested for significance by the log rank as well as the Breslow test.	0.4762721999087931
Significance of particular prognostic parameters was then evaluated by the Cox regression model.	0.43425076002910246
The overall survival time as well as the recurrence free survival time were significantly lower in patients who's tumors showed amplifications of the chromosomal region 11q13 (p=0.0008 for LR and p=0.0024 for B).	0.5409673495529695
The survival time of the patients was also lower if the carcinomas carried overrepresentations of chromosome 3q (p=0.0299 for LR and p=0.0546 for B).	0.5285647754373796
Multivariate analysis (Cox's proportional hazards model) revealed both alterations as most important independent prognostic factors in HNSCC.	0.5217290972343204
None of the conventional clinico-pathological parameters (pT-, pN-status, UICC stage, grading) achieved statistical significance in the multivariate model.	0.5655967795051524
These results suggest that in HNSCC the occurence of 11q13 amplification and 3q overrepresentation are highly significant independent prognostic markers and of better value than the established TNM and grading criteria.	0.43572289147665594
We report a coincidence of balloon cell melanoma and balloon cell transformation in a dermal nevus of a 56 years old female patient.	0.6369518078721964
The foamy cells in both tumors with different dignity expressed S-100 and Vimentin.	0.48095322797405904
HMB45 was expressed in all balloon cells of the melanoma.	0.4957316411253814
Detection of HMB45 in some of the nevus-associated balloon cells was considered as an expression of cellular activation.	0.5206945001654504
We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a malignant, primary plaque-type blue naevus in a 61-year-old male.	0.8116304729059782
Two biopsy specimens had been examined within 13 years, and revealed a common and cellular blue variant as a precursor.	0.5879134197325476
Locally invasive growth and regional lymph node swelling were present, but these alone could not confirm malignancy before evaluation of all clinical and histopathological features, as they are known to occur with benign cellular blue naevi.	0.7295156034992047
The recent literature and our case indicate that there is a malignant potential in every histological and clinical variant of blue naevus.	0.6105921948626895
It is difficult to provide valid data with regard to changes in incidence and prevalence of acute pancreatitis in Germany.	0.5196923194815722
The lack of information is due to strict legal regulations to protect personal data, a certain lack of interest in epidemiological research and the lack of exact statistics of diseases treated in hospitals.	0.6004392165805381
The incidence of acute pancreatitis in other industrialized Western countries is about 10 new cases per year and 100,000 inhabitants.	0.5371896367115001
The increase of alcohol consumption over the last 30 years is associated with an increase of ethanol-induced pancreatitis.	0.7194360618682252
One may speculate that due to improved diagnostic possibilities, such as CT scan, cases where acute pancreatitis is diagnosed at autopsy are rare.	0.49590157270691465
Due to the increase in alcohol consumption it can be assume that the incidence and prevalence of chronic pancreatitis have increased in Germany similar to well-documented data from Denmark.	0.7078250720411163
Since alcohol consumption is slightly decreasing in Germany it is likely that the present incidence of about 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis per 100,000 inhabitants will also decrease.	0.5800204387837613
Process-Experiential (PE) therapy is a neo-humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client-centered emphasis on a genuine, estecming, empathic relationship and the active, task-focused process-directive style of Gestalt therapie.	0.3072602085907551
This form of treatment is scientifically validated (Grawe 1997).	0.48980134584681967
Its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory.	0.19169721930590794
It incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks, each of which is characterized by specific client marker and resolution state, series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution, and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps.	0.33517586008302563
This second part of the review provides an overview of specific therapeutic tasks.	0.4909328079236464
At last suggestions for practical implementation are discussed, and available outcome data is summarized.	0.4543281002223741
The human arterial blood pressure shows not only exogenic alterations, but also spontaneous fluctuations.	0.6637011664983375
This blood pressure variability has both scientific and clinical relevance.	0.5262359364392563
A well-known phenomenon is the so-called "white coat hyptertension" which may severely affect diagnosis and therapy of essential hypertension.	0.657735360083952
Furthermore, several studies have provided evidence that the degree of end-organ damage in hypertensive patients is closely related to the circardian blood pressure variability.	0.7117703149624437
Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that an optimal antihypertensive treatment should take an improvement of the blood pressure variability into consideration.	0.8025942419500187
The faeces sign is a recently described computed tomography (CT) feature of small-bowel obstruction and is seen as a mottled, faeces-like content within the lumen of the dilated loops above the level of the obstacle.	0.5335098212250051
To evaluate its prevalence, significance, and diagnostic value we retrospectively reviewed 94 consecutive cases of small-intestine obstruction studied with CT in the last 6 years.	0.642436852049437
The faeces sign was recognizable in 7 cases (7.4 %) and was localized within ileal loops in all these subjects.	0.6923677192752479
In 6 of the 7 cases there was a simple and progressive obstruction, while there was a sudden onset with intestinal strangulation in only 1.	0.7082605072419882
The faeces sign is due to the intraluminal stagnation of enteric material and is generally recognizable in subjects with subacute obstruction.	0.47506171124764546
In our experience it is relatively uncommon.	0.4508493807997265
Nevertheless, it seems to be rather specific and may be a valuable accessory feature in the CT study of small-bowel obstruction.	0.8562613622685269
A case report is presented to illustrate the cutaneous manifestations in essential thrombocythaemia.	0.6690267858848885
Knowledge of the related skin lesions may lead to earlier detection of this myeloproliferative disorder.	0.5383751149827367
Treatment may prevent severe haemorrhagic or thrombotic complications.	0.2606076290008174
Erythromelalgia is causally related to thrombocythaemia; prompt relief of painful symptoms after treatment with aspirin is typical.	0.42192367224076605
Surgical treatment of proximal aortic disease traditionally consists of composite replacement of valve and aorta.	0.41710900395554634
Recent reconstructive procedures on the aortic root allow for treatment of aortic dilatation and concomitant aortic valve regurgitation without the associated disadvanteages of mechanical heart valves.	0.4523892971118541
Two psychotic patients developed hyperglycaemia several weeks after starting olanzapine.	0.3013217733264782
In one case the elevated glucose concentrations returned to normal soon after withdrawal of olanzapine.	0.5008228009456428
In the second case severe ketoacidosis with letal outcome occured.	0.48643130584034233
Profilometry is a novel procedure allowing precise analysis of skin surface structure.	0.40078516427322014
With the help of a synthetic material a negative image of a defined area of the skin is taken.	0.7566724703294461
During the subsequent analytical procedure the roughness is determined by means of a profilometer.	0.5122708941612611
A commercially available statistics software program is used for statistical analysis of the results.	0.5912952244757482
This procedure was applied to check for to evaluate positive effects of oestrogen creams on the structure of the skin surface on the face.	0.7232250949401969
This article describes the historic roots of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) from the first experiments at 1800 until the introduction into the pharmaceutical market in 1899.	0.5591795796349853
In 1869, Hermann Kolbe enlightened the chemical structure of salicylic acid, which was used at that time as an analgetic and antipyretic drug.	0.48937680169346237
Because of the side effects, for example the irritation of the stomach, analytical chemists and pharmacologists searched for chemical modifications.	0.6299402837099707
In August 1897 Felix Hoffmann (1868-1946) was successful in acetylizing the salicylic acid to acetylsalicyl acid (ASA).	0.44832116635763314
Between 1897 and 1899 Kurt Witthauer (1865-1911) collected clinical data and experiences on the efficiency of ASA as an analgetic and antipyretic drug.	0.34199962471008566
In 1899 ASA was introduced into the pharamaceutical market as Aspirin and became soon one of the most successful drugs of its time.	0.5486674539918047
The indication exceeds analgesia in the mean time and to prophylaxis of myocardial ischaemia or cerebral stroke, among others.	0.6072669118158882
Background: The results of the Cryo-ROP group showed that cryotherapy significantly reduces the rate of adverse morphological and functional outcome of eyes with threshold retinopathy of prematurity.	0.6178818339054911
Structural status and visual acuity of 48 eyes which consecutively underwent cryocoagulation in our hospital between 1990 and 1994 were examined at 2 years corrected gestational age.	0.5191770041567504
Despite wide-spread immunisation programs epidemic influenza continues to cause ten thousands of deaths worldwide, every year, especially in the high risk groups of elderly or immunocompromised persons.	0.5682085198822042
At present, amantadine and rimantadine are the only approved agents available for prophylactic and therapeutic use, yet, the deployment of these substances is problematic: neither of the two drugs is effective against influenza B, their use is accompanied by rapid development of viral resistance, and they show many adverse effects.	0.6754166255687234
In contrast, zanamivir and GS4071/GS4104 are rationally developed influenza-specific neuraminidase inhibitors, proving prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against influenza A and B, as well in vitro as in animal models, and in experimental human studies.	0.6244655968976163
Zanamivir and GS4071/GS4104 are well tolerated without adverse reactions after topic and oral administration, respectively.	0.36029516794356087
Resistant viral strains have been found in cell culture in the presence of both drugs, but the frequency of resistance emergence during clinical use is unclear.	0.7125678459361724
To date, the biggest recognizable disadvantage of neuraminidase inhibitors and Amantadin/Rimantadin alike is that they need to be given within 30-48 h after onset of symptoms, but seeking medical attention at this stage of infection does not seem to be realistic in medical practice.	0.5651712653192983
As neuraminidase inhibitors up to now could mainly be assessed by experimental data, specifically performed clinical trials will have to prove the positive influence of these drugs on the morbidity, course of infection, and mortality of high risk persons when administered for prophylaxis as well as for therapy.	0.6892011280710053
Background and purpose: Without recanalisation, acute basilar artery (BA) occlusion has a mortality of 90 %, which is reduced to 50 % if recanalisation is achieved.	0.6579386114558408
Fast diagnosis of BA occlusion is necessary in order to start thrombolytic therapy without delay.	0.4108778878864571
We wanted to assess the role of CT angiography (CTA) in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected acute BA occlusion.	0.6875048512844163
25 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD, 62  +/-  9 years) and 18 subjects free from cardiovascular disease (28  +/-  9 years) were tested on a cycle ergometer using a graded incremental test protocol: a) in the common upright position, b) as dynamic stress echocardiography in a semi-supine position.	0.7577811818587801
Whereas no relevant differences could be detected between the two conditions for the healthy subjects concerning heart rate, blood pressure, and rate-pressure product (2 x 3 ANOVA, t-test with -adjustment), the CHD patients showed both significantly higher heart rates as well as a significantly higher rate-pressure product (50 W: 15 300  +/-  2973 mmHg/min vs. 13 822  +/-  3042 mmHg/min; 75 W: 18 028  +/-  3479 mmHg/min vs 16 337  +/-  2619 mmHg/min) on equivalent stages during stress echocardiography if compared to the sitting position.	0.699286275366915
There were no differences for systolic blood pressure in this group; the diastolic values were higher in the sitting position at rest and during 50 W. Lactate concentrations (determined only in the healthy subjects) were significantly higher on all stages during dynamic stress echocardiography.	0.7803323521324028
The workload at the individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) was significantly lower.	0.7364704265400451
A new stoechiometric mixture of 27% dicalcium-phosphate (DCPA) and 73% tetra-calcium-phosphate (TTCP) can be prepared with water intraoperatively to a paste that subsequently sets to a structurally stabile implant composed of hydroxyapatite (HA).	0.4175190120480389
Primary setting time is about 20 min; pH during setting ranges from 6.5 to 8.5.	0.6827865333250202
There is no relevant curing heat or expansion or contraction.	0.4154795011183046
Compressive strength is about 50 MPa, tensile strength about 8 MPa.	0.32221740425304335
Over a period of about 4 h in physiological milieu, the cement converts to hydroxyapatite.	0.49649506055277
This product is no longer redissolvable  in normal body fluid.	0.46457489501750593
This cement can be used for non-load-bearing applications especially in craniofacial bone surgery.	0.5158049372958022
Cranial defects due to tumour or trauma as well as deficits in the facial skeleton may be reconstructed using this new biomaterial.	0.5195896281012132
In nine of ten patients we used the hydroxyapatite cement successfully for reconstructions in the craniofacial area.	0.4580555065783233
Fluid control of the operation field and implant site is extremely important and sometimes difficult to achieve.	0.5993131684664781
Further applications could be all non-load-bearing augmentations such as filling of blocked paranasal sinuses, of dentoalveolar cysts and defects following dental apectomy or fixation of implanted hearing-aid electrodes.	0.3976456671050241
The perspectives for the hydroxyapatite cement include its application as a carrier for osteogenic protein preparations, especially because of its isothermic reaction and intrinsic osteoconductive characteristics.	0.5031300699786194
We present a non-invasive epilepsy surgery protocol, which includes EEG-video-monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal positron emission tomography (PET) and ictal single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT).	0.572357222855711
According to this non-invasive protocol 50 of 173 patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy underwent resective surgery.	0.44720662430131847
The localization of the epileptogenic zone was based on the congruence of the localizing results of EEG-video-montoring, MRI, interictal PET and ictal SPECT.	0.5120468766454962
46 (92%) of the patients had temporal and 4 (8%) had extratemporal epilepsies.	0.9045222210199005
78% (n=39) of all patients operated according to our non-invasive protocol were postoperatively completely or almost seizure free.	0.7567463810261996
Extramesiotemporal resections could be carried out without invasive EEG-recording if the epileptogenic zone was not adjacent to the eloquent cortex.	0.3564424349953472
We conclude from our results that in a considerable number of patients with medically intractable particularly temporal focal epilepsies, resective epilepsy surgery can be based on non-invasive EEG-evaluations and the risk of invasive recordings can be avoided.	0.5956683247609598
Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) is mostly associated with a pancreatic-A-cell-glucagonoma and is considered to be a well-defined cutaneous paraneoplastic syndrome.	0.7533340044220677
We report on a 74-year old female who atypically developed a NME after surgical treatment of a rectal adenocarcinoma.	0.7596264957729256
Continuous staging and laboratory investigation over four years gave no evidence of any metastasis or further neoplasia.	0.4770954633382243
Hair samples and perspiration collected from long term drug addicts (n = 18) under constant methadone treatment were investigated.	0.4620912291279171
Hair segments representing the individual hair growth of 4 weeks were analyzed for methadone, opiates and cocaine by GC/MS.	0.49238294296250723
The results obtained from the transdermal collection devices confirmed the presence of drug substances in variable amounts on the skin surface, methadone being the main analyte.	0.6189665664809612
The perspiration test period lasted for 4 days.	0.32216261666581303
For six persons illicit drugs similar to those in the corresponding hair samples were found.	0.5061093999149067
Overall, a poor relationship (r = 0,602) was found between the methadone dose under steady state conditions and the methadone level in hair.	0.729545837987076
The results are discussed in the light of pharmacokinetic aspects, drug uptake by perspiration and forensic interpretation.	0.6875500644632194
Bilateral carotid artery dissection is a rare and unusual complication of blunt cervicofacial trauma.	0.5871820262748633
The diagnosis of a carotid injury is rarely suspected in trauma patients with neurological deficits.	0.6353778988875551
Neurological symptoms may develop in a delayed fashion.	0.388849306014675
Angiography should be considered in trauma patients with hemiplegia and a normal mental status and in patients with blunt cervical trauma with an abnormal neurological examination.	0.6869119657163308
Initial heparinisation can prevent arterial thrombosis and neurological deterioration.	0.3063000428617659

Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined by increased intraabdominal pressure above 20 mmHg with increased pulmonary peak pressure and oliguria.	0.5411088338731382
In primary abdominal compartment syndrome the increased intraabdominal pressure is caused directly by peritonitis, ileus or abdominal and pelvic trauma.	0.4804113916475043
Secondary compartment syndrome is a result of forced closure of the abdominal wall after abdominal surgery.	0.6512434236868574
The effects are decreased cardiac output, pulmonary atelectasis, oliguria to anuria and hepatic as well as intestinal reduction of perfusion.	0.44114971466337577
Effective monitoring is done by standardised measuring of urinary bladder pressure.	0.39650330075814777
Normal values are between 0 and 7 cm H2O, after elective laparotomies 5-12 cm H20.	0.6047826272046963
Above 25 cm H20 they are definitely pathological.	0.28405242441812206
For the prevention and therapy of manifested abdominal compartment syndrome the application of a laparostomy using a resorbable mesh is recommended.	0.6598801982530621
Between 1988 and 1999 we applied a laparostomy to lower the intraabdominal pressure in 377 patients.	0.4282906682647258
In 16 % of the cases it was indicated by primary abdominal compartment syndrome with a bladder pressure of 31  +/-  4 cm H20 preoperatively, which could be lowered to 17  +/-  4 cm H20 by laparostomy.	0.7878875597050575
An early reconstruction of the abdominal wall could be performed in 18 % of the cases.	0.92512961673544
Conclusions: The abdominal compartment syndrome is an often underestimated problem in abdominal surgery involving multiple organ systems.	0.594409589221341
The temporary laparostomy lowering intraabdominal pressure rather than a forced closure of the abdominal wall should be used in all circumstances.	0.646417506565209
In general, assessment of the correct placement of a central venous catheter is performed by fluoroscopy or by postinsertional chest X-ray.	0.5530032945163531
We report a case of intraaortic malposition of a central venous catheter in a 59-year-old male patient that was not detectable in chest films.	0.6090903526766986
Further exploration of this patient revealed a left-sided superior vena cava.	0.4548304009710659
Definition of the problem: In 1997, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) was performed in 138.001 cases in Germany.	0.6939870116672047
The standard indications, single vessel disease and badly controlled angina, are more and more extended to multivessel disease with and without severe angina, unstable or preinfarction angina, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) itself.	0.5583751927530554
Dilating asymptomatic stenoses of more than 70-80% is a widely used indication, intending prophylaxis of complete occlusion and AMI.	0.6498513754982649
Actually there is no generally accepted guideline for the different new indications, conservative versus invasive treatment schedule.	0.5233764449255864
It is difficult for the patient to get appropriate information before his decision between mechanical procedures and conservative methods; authentic informed consent actually seems to be in a very bad position.	0.6723278397546552
In 1992 the working group called "Arbeitsgemeinschaft leitender kardiologischer Krankenhausärzte (ALKK)" decided to start a registry of all PTCA procedures, in order to gain knowledge about the present status of PTCA in Germany.	0.5724243649914513
Up to March 1999, 198.608 PTCA are logged.	0.2933557409071466
Two children developed multiple melanocytic naevi after polychemotherapy administered for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in one and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the other.	0.5569120657435674
Induction of naevi does not seem to be related to specific agents used in chemotherapy, but rather to the immunosuppression resulting from multiple-agent chemotherapy.	0.5700183369122874
There are reports in the literature of both intrinsically and iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients who have developed multiple melanocytic naevi.	0.6019477663195155
Many small randomized studies with <beta>-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure have been published in recent years.	0.6683145554630958
A large meta-analysis by Lechat combining 18 studies with 3023 patients showed a 32% reduction in mortality in patients treated with <beta>-blockers.	0.5922516712792114
Mortality and hospitalization together were reduced by 37%.	0.39273385140599565
In 1998 two large randomized trials investigating Bisoprolol (CIBIS II) and Metoprolol (MERIT-HF) were finished.	0.5339712177658418
Both studies show a significant reduction in mortality in patients treated with <beta>-blockers.	0.6425739724124233
The ongoing COMET study compares <beta>1-selective blockers like metoprolol with vasodilatative <beta>-blockers like carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure.	0.4930885355747407
Large clinical registries demonstrate clinical practicability of <beta>-blocker treatment of patients with chronic heart failure.	0.5877189315351896
All patients with stabel chronic heart failure ought to be treated with <beta>-blockers additional to a basic therapy with ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis.	0.6558228007500875
The <beta>-blocker therapy regimen is to start with low doses and to increase the dose carefully:"Start low and go slow".	0.49174281735457165
Purpose: Cardiac imaging includes determination of the size and structure of the cardiac chambers, valves, great vessels and the coronary arteries, chamber and valvular function, myocardial perfusion, viability and metabolism.	0.6232267183099695
A 52-year-old patient presenting with severe thoracic pain of more than 30 minutes duration and ST-segment elevation > 1 mV in leads V1-3 was given 100 mg rt-PA. With persisting thoracic pain and ST-segment elevation, coronary angiography was performed 90 minutes after administration of thrombolytic therapy.	0.5840647485657088
Surprisingly, angiography revealed normal coronary arteries in presence of marked hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	0.4562881457699807
New onset of thoracic pain after four hours led to chest raiograph demonstrating increased mediastinal widening and new pleural effusion as compared to a baseline chest film prior to rt-PA. Spiral computed tomography revealed overt Type B aortic dissection with an intimal flap and communication distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with signs of a mediastinal hematoma.	0.567997794849635
Immediate cardiac surgery with replacement of the dissected aortic segment was successfully performed.	0.4152559671605502
A literature review revealed 4% of aortic dissection to present with electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial infarction and 13% to have concomitant coronary artery disease; moreover 34 cases of aortic dissection were misdiagnosed as infarction and subjected to thrombolytic agents with a mortality of 64% underlining the importance of exclusion of dissection prior to thombolytic therapy.	0.641808314582463
Between 1984 and 1996 we performed a Mason gastroplasty for the treatment of morbid obesity: 14 patients (average age 40 (26-48) years, body mass index (BMI) 48 (37-71) kg/m2, excessive body weight 67 (41-116) kg).	0.6343134207308124
Since the end of 1996 we now apply adjustable laparoscopic gastric banding (lab band): 73 patients (average age 39 (22-64) years, BMI 45 (32-69) kg/m2, excessive body weight 66 (41-116) kg).	0.6073187979381166
We compared the early and late results of both methods.	0.6550672001805679
Early results: no relevant morbidity or mortality for neither method.	0.4085374389379058
Late/intermediate results: reoperation rate for both methods 15 %.	0.49117969232183606
After an average of 3.7 years the excessive body weight loss (EWL) for gastroplasty was 54 (22-96) %.	0.8453211622122895
The EWL after lab band for 24 patients after 12 months was 47 (11-127) % and for 8 patients after 18 months 51 (28-139) %.	0.8254042739089795
Since the introduction of the lap band the number of bariatric operations has greatly increased.	0.3948295286578078
Nevertheless, the perioperative complication rate has remained low, and the long-term outcome is similar for both methods.	0.825492461103022
We investigated the relationships between prolactin (PRL) levels and antibody occurrence in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).	0.43750736942186874
No significant association between PRL levels and the majority of the autoantibodies studied (anti-U1 RNP, anti-rRNP, anti-Sm, anti-dsDNA, anti-DNP, auto-LCA, anti-EACA) could be confirmed (P > 0.05), anti-Ro/SSA antibodies being an exception.	0.5259171512473906
Our results showed significantly increased frequencies of these antibodies in the group of female SLE patients with normal PRL levels (< 20 µg/L): anti Ro/SSA in 53% (P < 0.025, 2 = 5.80, RR = 4.0) and anti-Ro/SSA + anti-Ro/La in 60% (P < 0.05, 2 = 4.05) compared with female SLE patients with hyperprolactinemia.	0.6734865216139321
An echinococcal cyst of the heart is a rare cause of acute cardiac tamponade.	0.7102689542418862
We report on a 24 year old male from the Kosovo who was brought in an emergency state from a provincial hospital complaining of severe dyspnea, thoracic pain, dizziness, and a short period of unconsciousness.	0.6925669806913142
Surgical decompression had to be performed urgently, because the pericardium could not be punctuated due to the position of the hydatid cyst.	0.7000280322194982
We report on the case of a 51-year-old female patient who had been suffering from multiple itching nodules for 3 years.	0.7107774282036198
Some of these lesions were classified clinically and histologically as keratoacanthomas (KA), whereas the multiple smaller nodules were found on histological examination to be either early stage KA or lesions of prurigo simplex subacuta.	0.6310066178456726
In two KA, HPV subtype 2 was identified by in situ hybridization.	0.4910047978935907
Treatment with etretinate resulted in remission of the fully developed KA and reduced the occurrence of new ones.	0.4616104847654471
The outbreak of multiple KA in our patient resembled a rare subtype described by Witten and Zak.	0.4276647373138594
Postclinical follow-up for 28 months to date has revealed that the KA arise from the subacute prurigo lesions.	0.5548450313098003
This mode of prurigo-dependent KA development has not previously been reported.	0.36834807776657863
We describe a rare case of a papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve occurring simultaneously with a cystic tumor (a so-called mesothelioma) of the atrioventricular nodal region.	0.7660508363135246
At autopsy the tumor was found to prolapse into and occlude the right coronary ostium, leading to an acute, recurring myocardial infarction.	0.6405553789702483
Histological examination of the grossly unremarkable conduction system of the heart revealed a cystic tumor in the region of the atrioventricular node.	0.7505941403541883
To our knowledge, this is the first report of coexistence of these two rare cardiac tumors.	0.6452999561657184

In anaesthesising a 31-year-old paraplegic primigravida with a complete transverse spinal lesion at T4 for an elective caesarean section, no indication of hypertonic cardiovascular dysregulation either intra- or postoperatively was observed after repeated epidural administration of bupivacaine.	0.5624502117542829
Distinct intraoperative spasticity of the abdominal wall muscles was, however, not influenced by the dosages selected.	0.5603703712735663
Repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless method to induce transient activation in circumscript regions of the human cortex.	0.6102750519509935
In contrast to TMS with single pulses rTMS allows a more effective stimulation of association cortex and temporary interference with the proper functioning of stimulated areas.	0.4565507316094461
Possible applications for examination of the functional anatomy of language lateralisation, memory functions and visual perception are discussed.	0.5391046515940966

An unusual shaped piece of skin was found in the oral cavity of a woman who had been stabbed to death.	0.6511030931277046
Physical examination of the victim's numerous male acquaintances revealed one to have an injury of the same shape on the ventral surface of the left ring finger.	0.6822192315140271
Molecular biological investigations showed that this suspect and the piece of skin exhibited corresponding DNA patterns (frequency 1 : 700 000).	0.40066863904639677
This case underlines the importance of physical examination as a preliminary to further detailed investigation.	0.4330423270171725
Nineteen men with post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence grade II and III (mean follow-up 12.7 months) underwent periurethral injections of collagen.	0.687783069317023
In all, 37 procedures were performed; 58 % of the patients underwent the procedure at least twice.	0.7361058534420325
A mean of 16 ml collagen was injected.	0.46146257188118933
The results were successful directly after injections, leaving all patients continent; however, after 3 months the treatment failed and all patients returned to their incontinence status as seen preoperatively.	0.6449166471308777
No perioperative complications were noted.	0.3321626399981282
Despite the simple and safe nature of this procedure, men with severe postoperative stress incontinence do not benefit from periurethral collagen injections.	0.5064148856850477
After a short review of the literature, some aspects of the psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania with an adolescent patient are presented that up to now have not been described in great detail.	0.828245017368517
Against the backdrop of previous fears of being abandoned, the patient feels threatened that while coping with the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness she will be dropped once again.	0.5342576846450132
This psychodynamically oriented therapy makes it possible for the patient to accept and verbalize the corresponding feelings in a relationship that gives a feeling of security.	0.5724830243241444
Therefore, the symptoms that previously served the purpose of regulating diffuse inner tensions and fears may be abandoned.	0.5410454733762904
According to sonographic criteria, 55 patients underwent surgical treatment with mobilisation in a lower leg plaster or conservative treatment with early mobilisation in heel pad (3 cm) shoes when an acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) was diagnosed.	0.6557951207863243
The follow-up period in 51 patients was 2.4 years (operated group = 28 patients, conservative group = 23 patients) with clinical examination and testing of isokinetic muscle strength in knee joint flexion.	0.8282127816339934
After surgical treatment, minor wound infections occurred in 10.6 %.	0.5845999928654897
Reruptures occurred in 13 % of the conservative group.	0.7289911747312439
Following conservative treatment, the rate of stress-related achillodynia was significantly higher (P = 0.019).	0.6213215952641146
In the operated group mean isokinetic muscle strength was 13.7 % lower than in the uninvolved leg and decreased significantly with non-operative treatment to 75.3 % (P = 0.012).	0.6883718373028466
We recommend surgical treatment of acute ATR.	0.6884517720779478
The indications for conservative treatment depend on the extent of the rupture (measured by ultrasound in the equinus position), the desired level of daily activity and the patient's degree of compliance.	0.7335501797174977
"MicroSort" promises to become a reliable method for preselecting the sex of our children.	0.4737090092365474
As so many innovations in the field of assisted reproductive technology, however, sex selection raises difficult moral and legal issues.	0.43363736109242784
In this paper, we focus on the question whether or not sex selection calls for a legal ban.	0.679561909991791
Since it does not seem to imply any serious harm to others, we argue in favour of the legalization of sex selection.	0.5322712205242806
Acute limb ischemia is an emergency which regularly requires operative treatment in departments of general surgery.	0.4764896533068151
In about 70 % of cases there is an embolic reason for acute ischemia.	0.820830330310833
In the majority of cases urgent operative desobliteration is required to guarantee limb salvage.	0.5240277644048876
The introduction of balloon catheters reduced the surgical trauma significantly in cases of long secondary thromboses.	0.5072291515614893
More complex procedures are required in patients with preexisting chronic arterial occlusive disease.	0.5025248489789048
The mortality of these emergency operations is still 10-20 % with a limb salvage rate of 80-90 %.	0.6921581259260791
Infectious complications related to acquired neutropenia have become a major medical issue, often requiring intensive care management.	0.4919885551346274
These infections may be lethal if empirical broad-spectrum treatment is not rapidly started at the first sign of infection (i.e., fever), and this concept is now widely recognized a standard practice.	0.5929136296582966
However, the choice of antibiotics has generated considerable controversy for nearly 25 years.	0.48155374764905606
After reviewing some particularities of infection in neutropenic patients, this paper will discuss the options and present comprehensive algorithm for non-infectious diseases specialist, including recent advances about early IV-oral switch and the selection of low risk patients for outpatient management.	0.6058097456827682
Background: It has been suggested that inflammatory processes play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS).	0.6456779497599155
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a classic acute phase protein.	0.49462931711614694
It is yet unclear whether, in addition to established markers as troponin T (TnT), determination of CRP in patients admitted for ACS contributes significantly to the diagnosis and prognosis of ACS.Patients and Methods: We investigated 50 patients with ACS (59.4 SD 13.9 years) in the first hour after admission and 4-24h later with respect to TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).	0.6793696015989006
Fifty percent of the patients were classified as having unstable angina retrospectively.	0.8985412553729509
All patients were followed in the 6 weeks post discharge regarding death and recurrent ACS.Results: The cumulative event rate at 6 weeks after discharge was 62.5% for patients being CRP and TnT positive compared to 35.3% in TnT positive and CRP negative patients.	0.7163155352619877
In TnT negative patients a positive CRP test predicted 33.3% of events and 28.8% of patients negative for CRP and TnT had events at 42 days post discharge.	0.6411083172473017
Logistic regression analysis regarding the primary endpoint including TnT and CRP (4-24h values), age, gender and diagnosis resulted in independent prediction of ACS or death by TnT (cutoff 0.1µg/L, p=0.048, odds ratio=7.5) and CRP (cutoff 0.862mg/dL, p=0.026, odds ratio=5.3).	0.4967445717419904
Sensitivity/specificity for AMI diagnosis were 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP 4-24h later.Conclusions: Besides TnT, high sensitivity CRP determination has no additional value for early AMI diagnosis.	0.748366540520993
The prognosis of these patients during the first 24 hours is significantly and independently predicted by CRP measurements in addition to troponin T.	0.7826610618534482
Purpose: Evaluation of clinical and morphological results in 44 consecutive patients with 45 aneurysms of the posterior circulation.	0.7094011762459072
Following coronary artery bypass grafting repeat ischemia mandatory for reintervention occurs in 2 to 30% of cases, depending mainly on graft age.	0.6421392363707432
Selection of a suitable strategy for revascularisation - transcatheter angioplasty or reoperation - depends on various parameters including coronary morphology, left ventricular performance, comorbidity and availability of graft material.	0.5949607018768384
Catheterbased interventions on saphenous vein bypass grafts are feasible, but lower primary success rates and a higher incidence of restenosis - compared with native coronary arteries - have to be expected.	0.7072893317127251
Repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations are associated with a significantly higher perioperative morbidity and mortality, patency rates are lower and late clinical outcome is worse than in primary surgery.	0.6061900299899662
We report on a patient who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 4 years ago revealing a high grade ostial stenosis in a jump-graft supplying RCA, LAD and Cx sequentially, making reintervention necessary.	0.5598811103067083
As a prerequisite serial balloon angioplasty of two native vessels was performed prior to ostial intervention.	0.4029797207880119
Intravascular-ultrasound guided directional coronary atherectomy was performed with good primary and long-term result.	0.5788753816107816
Our case demonstrates that, if all relevant clinical parameters and different therapeutic options are taken into account, complex transcatheter angioplasty procedures are feasible and associated with a reasonable amount of risk, thus avoiding repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations.	0.721139220205534
In recent years the indication for a mastectomy for breast cancer has been increasingly restricted.	0.623242558186357
The use of plastic reconstructive techniques enhances the rate of breast-conserving therapy even for large breast tumors with excellent cosmetic results and oncological safety.	0.4804385485637634
The breast-to-tumor ratio and locally complete resection with free tumor margins of 1-2 cm are the most important factors in breast-conserving surgery.	0.7066653272568272
Different techniques of reduction mammoplasty within the concept of oncological breast surgery not only allow large tumors in large breasts to be resected, but also relatively large tumors in normal sized or even smaller breasts to be resected.	0.614950925451319
Other advantages are the reduction of breast size and therefore target volume before postoperative radiation procedures as well as in cancer prophylaxis and risk reduction by reducing ipsi- and contralateral breast tissue.	0.5821284163787989
Reduction mammoplasty techniques with different resection areas have to be selected for individual tumor locations.	0.4922122820042283
The best symmetry is achieved by bilateral mammoplasty in a one step procedure with lumpectomy and axillary dissection.	0.422751432783087
Oncoplastic or reconstructive surgery in the target breast is often followed by procedures to improve symmetry by contralateral reduction.	0.5115908740787963
Whenever possible, mammoplasty techniques with minimal scarring should be chosen out of a variety of reduction procedures.	0.46173041195779635
Epidermoid cysts are rare, benign tumors of the testis or, less frequently, the inguinal cord.	0.6804053138817069
Generally, they affect males between 10 and 39 years.	0.5043061818188007
In newborns they are rare.	0.3443373176091073
We report on a newborn with an epidermoid cyst of the right testis that had been diagnosed in utero and was removed with preservation of the testicle.	0.6774355461014245
Although there are various published descriptions of the dura mater spinalis [4, 7, 9, 11, 16], some points relating to the texture of the collagen fibres in the dura have still not been adequately explained.	0.6602100673884245
In this study the orientation of the collagen fibril bundles was revealed with the aid of scanning electron microscopy, and our observations have yielded new insights into the three-dimensional structure of the human dura mater spinalis.	0.6839103144769717
Reconstructive plastic surgery is not always possible or advisable for nasal defects following tumor resections.	0.5285753663065857
Facial prostheses offer an alternative therapy.	0.3624191574996658
Since 1991, 37 patients with nasal defects after tumor surgery were treated in the Berlin Center of Facial Prostheses: 28 received "soft" silicone facial prostheses and 9 "solid" polymethylmetacrylate facial prostheses.	0.5863370121673559
In 35 patients protheses were bone-anchored: Brånemark implants were used in 12 patients and an Epitec frame construction in 23 patients.	0.5896217183465303
Glue-on prostheses were applied to only two patients.	0.4311607633115308
No intraoperative complications occurred at implant insertion.	0.288297342686288
During following visits only minor inflammations were observed around implants and were treated locally.	0.35449126379589335
The implant success rate was 78% for the Brånemark implants (89.7% in non- radiated areas and 50% in radiated areas) and 100% in radiated and non-radiated areas for the Epitec system.	0.8505222638780894
Our investigation shows that given the right indication, the bone-anchored facial prosthesis is safe, cosmetically acceptable, uncomplicated and not stressful for the patient.	0.5591096078879779
We report a patient who developed malignant transformation of a cellular blue nevus.	0.6715897171549413
At the age of 19 years the congenital, pigmented tumor on the left buttock was histopathologically diagnosed as cellular blue nevus.	0.5206805975144856
Thirty years later the tumor dramatically increased in size, involving the entire left buttock within several months.	0.49219435786471255
Multiple biopsies revealed the presence of a cellular blue nevus within the papillary dermis and an invasive, pleomorphic pigmented sarcoma in the depth of the tissue spreading into subcutis and skeletal muscle.	0.49242568392224634
Both benign and malignant cells were S100+, vimentin+ and HMB-45+, but only the malignant tumor cells stained positive for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen.	0.5695929472883079
General examination disclosed multiple metastases in the paraaortal lymph nodes and the retroperitoneum as well as a single brain metastasis.	0.6091484171509616
Despite palliative therapy with ionizing radiation and chemotherapy, the patient developed generalized metastases and died within weeks.	0.7691786656401044
This case clearly confirms that cellular blue nevi have the potential for malignant transformation and that the malignant variant may behave aggressively just as a malignant melanoma.	0.612843804989079
(Acitve alert) Hypnosis and sports in the psychotherapy of out-patients with anxiety disorders.	0.36003745857050634
A process-oriented approach combining hypnotherapeutic with cognitive-behavioral concepts within a systemic model of psychotherapy for the outpatient treatment of anxiety disorders is outlined.	0.5073696961389105
The use of active alert hypnosis (hypnosis by bicycle ergometry) combining elements of hypnotherapy and sports therapy is adapted to patients characteristics and the process of therapy.	0.47258214012730293
Relaxation and active alert hypnosis and different sports are used as methods of cue exposure respectively training of competence.	0.42919708697927533
The treatment is sequentially structured (motivation, symptom-control, conflict, integration).	0.4666191194239269
Active alert hypnosis catalyses the therapeutic process within the stage of symptom-control (reduction of anxiety and depression) and of conflict (modifcation of intrapsychic conficts or traumata within trance induced by physical exercises).	0.5596510848702719
Therapeutic goals and techniques for each stage are specified by case examples.	0.3278333090040537
Endoscopic techniques in the spine have become possible with improvements in instrumentation.	0.5140474179043985
Other minimally invasive techniques are limited to intradiscal surgery, not at the site of the pathology.	0.6623080787290906
With the transforaminal approach, treatment in the epidural space has become possible.	0.6879030133050859
In a pilot study we investigated the pitfalls, risks, and complications of transforaminal surgery.	0.6253839178439993
Patient satisfaction and acceptance of the method were documented.	0.6479245851784291
Some 27 patients with disk pathologies at the level of the disk space, excluding extremely medially situated herniations, were treated.	0.5750878679255139
We used a standard posterolateral approach under local anesthesia combined with spinal morphine anesthesia.	0.4510461456792697
The treated levels were L5/S1 (11), L4/5 (12), L3/4 (3), and L2/3 (1).	0.6823016402267505
All areas could be reached by this approach.	0.37377741536411796
One procedure had to be abandoned because of instrumentation problems.	0.37057639509892887
One patient had recurrent disk herniation and had an open procedure.	0.4093079413491562
Two patients were reoperated because of persistent pain.	0.5851386305027725
No signs of reherniation could be found in these cases, but there was swelling of the nerve root and minimal scarring.	0.742949728109925
Minor complications were trancient root paresthesia and headache postoperatively.	0.2933583023751106
Postoperative MRI or CT scans revealed only little scar tissue.	0.3562119437061855
This impression was supported in the open revisions we performed.	0.38946024490589176
Clinical acceptance of the procedure was excellent and the patients recovered very quickly.	0.7439770858215923
Endoscopic transforaminal surgery has a considerable learning curve, even when surgeons are acquainted with the posterolateral approach and arthroskopic surgery.	0.5420288928429017
However, it offers a good alternative to other minimally invasive procedures and has to be seen as a good alternative to open disk surgery, too.	0.7864069253712532
Quality management in a rescue coordination center (RCC) not only needs an evaluation of quantitative parameters (such as time intervals), but also an examination of the correlation between suspected and real found emergency situations.	0.6478040163943088
For that purpose it is necessary to request feedback informations about kind and severity of the emergency situation from the emergency medical team working at the scene.	0.6387791892232435
The case of a fatal catheter-induced cardiac tamponade in a 81-year-old woman is reported.	0.5919036090079588
Death occurred after a delay of 18 h following placement of a central venous catheter for parenteral feeding.	0.5065188908296075
According to the clinical and histological findings, placement of the catheter caused a primary perforation.	0.843556239446385
Confirmation of proper placement of the catheter tip was not performed.	0.4898817323325444
Despite clinical indications on the forthcoming complication, sufficient emergency treatment was not carried out.	0.4671829011750143
Background: The rapid integration of new technology into ophthalmologic practice, e. g. LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis), is associated with new complications.	0.5921405537624104
The limitations of the new technology cannot be precisely determined.	0.5292674071994038
During lamellar cuts with microkeratomes intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations occur.	0.32021386824954684
The IOP elevation during the lamellar cut cannot be determined by conventional tonometry.	0.39898047512711754
Due to its superior soft tissue contrast conventional MRI is the imaging method of  choice in the evaluation of ankle joint disorders.	0.5317137533650941
Conventional MR imaging can accurately demonstrate normal or acutely injured ligaments; however, in subacute and chronic injury joint fluid necessary for delineation of injured ligaments is absent and MR arthrography should be performed.	0.45878708559773596
MR arthrography uses the intraarticular injection of contrast material to distend the joint, yielding improved discrimination of intraarticular structures.	0.45339363932735544
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in the staging of osteochondritis dissecans, since in cases of unstable lesions tracking of contrast material into the interface can be more easily demonstrated.	0.5695667217556942
Finally, high contrast and joint distension by MR arthrography improves the detection of intraarticular loose bodies, which often require surgery.	0.63713408746613
MR arthrography, although invasive, may provide additional information in various ankle joint disorders.	0.662827544780401
Several studies have demonstrated an association Chlamydia pneumoniae with coronary artery disease, suggesting that infection with C. pneumoniae increases the risk for coronary artery disease by factor 2 or more.	0.7152906840140819
Since atherosclerosis is considered to be a chronic inflammatory process, these data would fit into the response-to-injury hypothesis of atherosclerosis rather than representing a completely novel concept.	0.6321164026265268
Several pathomechanisms as increased cytokine synthesis, proliferative and proaggregatory effects could transmit the effects of chronic C. pneumoniae infection.	0.4750214366065635
Animal models and first clinical trials using antibiotic therapy seem to support an etiological role of C. pneumoniae in coronary artery disease.	0.5271672286631202
In this paper the current knowledge of the role of C- pneumoniae in coronary artery disease is reviewed and possible pathomechanisms are discussed.	0.7581987267116825
Preeclampsia is a disorder specific to pregnancy which can affect all maternal organs.	0.39086185598777545

Patients usually recover completely however some patients remain disabled due to cerebrovascular damage.	0.2764577854592642
Intracerebral and subarachnoidal hemorrhage are severe however rare complications of eclampsia.	0.3273179459244463
TCD investigations regularly find vasospasm in all great cerebral arteries.	0.24785635063336536
Reversible hypodense lesions in the white matter on early CT-scans and increased signal intensities on T2-weighted MRT images indicate local edema.	0.44160046418083887
The etiology of preeclampsia and eclampsia remains unknown and its current pathophysiology is still hypothetical.	0.4607689008199816
The clinical picture may best be explained by an endothelial dysfunction with increased vascular sensivity to circulating pressure agents as well as by a structural endothelial lesion with fluid loss from the intravascular compartment.	0.5498610907566939
This article reviews the surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability.	0.6652554116623589
The treatment rationale includes exact definition of the instability pattern ("envelope-of-motion" of the tibia) by clinical examination, arthrometry and stress radiography.	0.7370812123460023
Exact evaluation of the osseous anatomy is mandatory to identify an eventual varus morphotype.	0.4752611273728993
This osseous variant in combination with posterior/posterolateral instability should be treated by an osteotomy in every case.	0.5917896269222498
The technique of additive osteotomy to correct varus and increase the sagittal tilt of the proximal tibia is described.	0.5341553948616915
Ligament reconstruction in chronic posterior knee instability must address the posterior cruciate ligament and the lateral/posterolateral structures in many cases.	0.5185923140304619
Patellar tendon grafts, quadriceps tendon grafts or hamstrings can be used for posterior cruciate ligament replacement.	0.5738406811774599
Arthroscopic or mini-open techniques may be used for graft placement, direct posterior fixation of the graft via a posterior incision is an option for patellar tendon grafts.	0.6315712858984064
Bousquet's biceps plasty or Clancy's biceps tenodesis may be used for posterolateral stabilization; a biceps tendon strip can also be used for lateral collateral ligament reconstruction.	0.5316047718813363
Results of surgery are still moderate.	0.37219814198965323
In the author's series of chronic posterior/posterolateral instability, 26 cases were treated with posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and biceps tenodesis.	0.6608356738720718
Follow-up at 18 months demonstrated increased stability (mean residual posterior drawer 8 mm at 70  ° and 20 lb force) and improved knee function (33 % IKDC B, 67 % IKDC C).	0.701921693386205
Presently, surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability should be restricted to centers devoted to this problem.	0.7053761806199497

Health policy in Germany has in recent years given priority to the self-administration of physicians, sickness funds, and hospital associations.	0.5831073473490569
Hence, legal regulations on quality assurance have focused on defining responsibilities and areas of primary importance, while precise processes are being defined by the self-administration.	0.5632692075227487
As prices for health care are increasingly restricted by lump sum payments, quality and quality assurance become more important as a factor in competition between health care providers.	0.5524639616210894
To support the implementation of quality assurance in the health care system, the German Federal Ministry of Health has funded model-projects, e.g., to support the adaptation of successful strategies of total quality management for health care.	0.7338244742565991
The research field of tissue engineering combines cells biology, biomaterial science, and surgery.	0.5719998991376237
Major long-term goals are tissue and organ replacement therapies using the patients' own cells.	0.5971211760168877
Our work is focused on the treatment of severe joint defects and on plastic surgery using in vitro engineered cartilage tissues.	0.5361077433497755
The practical approaches in cartilage engineering face problems with three-dimensional cell distribution or cell immobilization raising biocompatibility problems.	0.36774387206184084
The tissue engineering of cartilage is based on combining biocompatible cell embedding substances such as fibrin, agarose, alginate, hyaluronic acid and fiber fleece scaffolds of poly -hydroxy acids (PLLA/PGLA).	0.35171709795624095
Different technical approaches were established: a) three-dimensional in vitro cultures of chondrocytes for the development of vital tissue transplants and b) interacting three-dimensional cultures consisting of different cell populations, such as BMP-transfected mesenchymal cells.	0.5238173651950898
The preshaped artificial tissue constructs were cultured in perfusion chambers to maintain a stable diffusion of nutrients during the in vitro pre-formation step.	0.42689725746233653
Subsequently, pre-formed tissues were implanted into nude mice and into 4mm articular joint defects of rabbits.	0.3417340723003479
Transplants were found to produce cartilage typic morphological patterns and matrix.	0.467911704554482
80% of the transplants remained stable in vivo.	0.5012310394213243
However, 20% of the tissues are resorbed or replaced by a fibrous tissue.	0.5833826416415587
These results demonstrate that current artificial cartilage transplants are already feasible for plastic reconstruction.	0.3399940304997851
The treatment of severe joint defects, however, faces additional problems which are addressed in ongoing studies: (a) the fixation of engineered cartilage in joints, (b) the protection against chronic inflammatory degradation, and (c) the required enormous mechanical stability.	0.7399521721431297
Background: Silicon-rubber central venous catheters have become commonplace in the care of premature infants.	0.4301372196363879

The ARO multicenter study intended to show clinical and radiological differences with regard to different systems of fixation and designs of the prothesis in total hip replacement in patients with hip dysplasia, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.	0.5368755209346793
In 1987 and 1988 5255 total hip prothesis were implanted by the 24 hospitals which took part in the study.	0.4546864523447156
3133 prothesis (95,6 %) were clinically and radiologically examined.	0.6960564365374267
The follow-up period averaged 6.9 years.	0.8364991131000669
The results of the Aro multicenter-study showed that despite difficult preoperative conditions especially in cases of rheumatoid arthritis the satisfaction rate improved remarkably.	0.518775496250885
During the operation less complications arose in comparison to patients with hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis.	0.6306430760295126
Regarding the rate of infection after operation there were no differences between the 3 groups.	0.7549575837801623
Only the rate of postoperative luxation concerning rheumatoid patients turned out to be twice the number of the others.	0.5043147926729575
In our opinion this is due to the fact that these rheumatics were operated by posterior approach.	0.552942838708557
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis were satisfied most with their surgeries.	0.32825870755281567
Results of rheumatic patients according to Harris hip score were slightly worse than the results of the two other groups.	0.6294453076406207
This was due to systemic involvement and bad preoperative function of the hip.	0.5771483975414765
As a result of the study there were no differences in using cemented or cementless techniques for rheumatic hip replacement.	0.6835077985569926
The decision for the method of fixation should depend on the patient's ability to relief the prothesis after operation.	0.6444567809476238
The study has shown that cementless implantation can also be used for young rheumatics provided that a suitable design of prothesis will be selected.	0.5470836950381115
Sepsis developing on the basis of a postoperative infection is a rare, but life-threatening event.	0.73069920787374
Early diagnosis of postoperative complications usually facilitates decisive intervention and a favorable prognosis.	0.5364556460076499
If the right moment is missed, endothelial damage leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and generalized systemic infection (SIRS).	0.49034993062274
For the subsequentially developing septic shock, often combined with multiple organ failure (MOF), it is not important whether the starting point was an uncontrollable infections focus, ischemic damage following hypovolemic shock, or massive bacterial translocation with postoperative bowel obstruction.	0.554493932391983
The collapse of the immune system results in immune paralysis and explains the inability of the organism to defend itself against systemic infections.	0.4086130852642324
For early recognition of the developing septic complication and its effective treatment, pathophysiological and clinical issues are discussed.	0.45944236319963655
The comparison of prediction of mortality and sepsis by different score systems was the objective of this retrospective study in 51 patients.	0.5907461177665524
Specific scores for burned patients - "Abbreviated Burn Severity Index" (ABSI) and the "Baltimore Sepsis Scale" (BSS) were compared with the general intensive score systems: "Mortality Prediction Model" (MPM II), "Simplified Acute Physiology Score" (SAPS II), APACHE II (ApII), "Hannover Intensive Score" (HIS) and the sepsis score developed by Elebute and Stoner (ES).	0.7466544804004707
On days 1 and 3 the true-positive ratio (sensitivity) was plotted against false-positive ratio (1-specifity) for each score.	0.7491722920475742
The area under the curve (max.	0.38976850345302827
0.5) correlates with the quality of the score system.	0.7627267033431002
We also tested the discrimination of septic and nonseptic patients by using the different scores.	0.5637050782293993
Bilateral symmetric changes in the cerebral hemispheric white matter are found with increasing frequency using CT and MRI techniques.	0.5736962246727445
These unspecific canges of the white matter signal are often called leukoaraiosis.	0.3365315377544811
They differ from the normal white matter signal.	0.4797570720796457
These changes are found with increasing frequency in persons older than 60 years and also patients with dementia and cerebrovascular diseases.	0.5650783703729128
The pathogenesis, clinical significance and morphological substrate are unclear.	0.49977548854226544
The aim of this review is to summarise the actual knowledge about the etiology and clinical signs and symptoms found in patients with leukoaraiosis.	0.8568063032249893
This term should not be used when white matter changes are found in patients younger than 35 years, with an unilateral onset, asymmetric distribution, and extensive changes all over the infra- and supratentorial white matter area.	0.7415968583699091
Neuroradiological and clinical criteria are given to differentiate between leukoaraiosis and diseases of the white matter, especially enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces, lacunar infarction, subcortical arteriosclerotic angiopathy (Binswanger's disease), leukoencephalopathy of different origin, and demyelinating diseases.	0.538288495619655
A case with various skeletal abnormalities, soft tissue masses and skin lesions diagnosed as Proteus syndrome is reported.	0.5270241176194193
Proteus syndrome is included in the differential diagnosis of many disorders, because of the polymorphous nature of its clinical manifestations.	0.612774987870735
It is a rare disorder and leads to functional disabilities as well as cosmetic and psychological problems.	0.734301058052298
Early diagnosis and careful follow-up with appropriate surgical interventions is important in preventing long-term complications.	0.6890577295631143
The value of elective PTA in stenoses of the supraaortic vessels and especially of the carotid artery is still under discussion.	0.561979966680132
Stenoses after surgical and/or radiation therapy and a high cardio-vascular risk for a surgical procedure, however, justify minimal-invasive techniques.	0.6497038363528974
Profiles of fundamental frequency sound pressure levels and voice duration are measured separately in clinical practice.	0.4413071536581748
It was the aim of the present study to combine the two examinations, in order to estimate the relationship between pitch, sound pressure level and voice duration and to develop a new computer-assisted graph.	0.7152724090360534
A three-dimensional (3D) wireframe phonogram was constructed based on SPL profiles to obtain a general view of the parameters recorded.	0.48828727978907965
We have termed this "phonetography".	0.28615121536217575
Variable further projections were selected for the analysis of different aspects of parametric relationships.	0.3853032938633815
The results in 21 healthy volunteers and 4 patients with hyperfunctional dysphonias demonstrated that there were three typical figures of the 3D phonograms produced, depending on the relationship between voice duration when soft ("piano") compared to loud ("forte").	0.6381220174753038
In one-third of the healthy volunteers, the values of the piano voice duration were greater than those of forte for almost all pitches examined.	0.6648166170223008
In two-thirds of the healthy subjects the values of forte voice duration were partly greater, as were those of piano voice duration.	0.6107933690796079
All of the patients showed voice duration values greater for forte than for piano.	0.662197957036969
The results of the study demonstrate that the 3D phonogram is a useful tool for obtaining new insights into various relationships of voice parameters.	0.7006476584798133
Sinus histiocytosis is as a rule a benign disease of lymph nodes, infiltrated by large histiocytes.	0.5084058251486854
These cells show typical cytophagocytosis, particularly lymphophagocytosis.	0.4555257769648654
Other organs may be also involved by this disease, often including the skin.	0.49348012731483387
Exclusive cutaneous sinus histiocytosis without infiltration of lymph nodes seems to be very rare.	0.5493132096232618
To exclude other non-X histiocytoses or histiocytosis-X, it is advisable to use immunohistochemistry.	0.536788715298548
We report on a patient with sinus histiocytosis and discuss the problems of differential diagnosis.	0.6263495849816078
The case of a five-year-old girl with intractable fluor vaginalis and recurrent perianal fistulas is reported.	0.5584823675387676
A presacral dermoid cyst was shown to be the cause of these symptoms.	0.6994992611741976
Extensive radiological investigation revealed the cyst and the associated fistulas extending into the perianal region and the vagina.	0.4556407875190736
After verification of the anatomical situation, an uneventful surgical procedure was carried out.	0.7665479739971601
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive functional method for the study of solid tumor perfusion, metabolism and interaction with different therapeutic agents.	0.6370115406934176
The aim of the study was the investigation of the metabolism of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and the kinetics during a treatment with intratumoral ethanol by PET.	0.7903536415228818
The ongoing study includes seven patients with child A cirrhosis and HCC (UICC stage III-IVA; tumor size 3-6 cm).	0.5769926778701253
Dynamic PET studies (60 min) with 18F-fluordeoxyglucose (FDG) were performed prior to therapy to assess tumor viability.	0.7900984100960408
The evaluation of the FDG data demonstrated a liver-equivalent uptake in six of the tumors (well and moderately differentiated HCC), which were poorly delineated against the normal liver parenchyma.	0.6639244962688657
One moderately differentiated HCC showed an increased FDG metabolism, indicating no correlation between histology and metabolism.	0.5307573328932339
A dose of 37-80 MBq 11C-ethanol was applied together with a nonlabelled therapeutic dose of the drug via a puncture needle positioned under sonography.	0.5368459250777404
Five out of seven tumors demonstrated a high 11C uptake shortly after the end of the ethanol injection followed by constant 11C-ethanol concentration during the whole study period of 45 min.	0.47210104972744404
The PET data demonstrated no significant elimination of the 11C-ethanol from the tumor and no accumulation in the surrounding liver tissue.	0.6011056053124167
One case showed a decrease of the intratumoral 11C-ethanol concentration due to a punkture of a tumor vein, and in another case the surrounding liver parenchyma demonstrated significant 11C uptake in the early phase following paratumoral injection of the drug.	0.8176801634576505
In conclusion, PET is a useful tool for the study of the mechanism and the kinetics of percutaneous intratumoral ethanol injection of HCC.	0.7005828073533924
During the last decade, many investigations were conducted in order to understand the mechanisms involved in the development of acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	0.6299060221124455
However, the increasing knowledge, instead of clarification, leads us to realize that these terms may assemble a wide variety of lung pathologies.	0.5752219760266661
Indeed, many circumstances can result in these syndromes and no particular factor has been defined to distinguish ARDS of one etiology from another.	0.5428902966835595
We are still ignorant about which factors lead to the extended inflammation from pneumonia to ARDS, while it is not clear whether the timing of events are determined by some mediators.	0.6092486654284882
Furthermore, in the clinical arena, there is no clear distinction between pneumonia, severe pneumonia which may lead to ALI and then ARDS.	0.7764292205735236
Finally, the results of all these studies should have allowed us to investigate new therapeutical approaches while none seems to emerge.	0.6086688765741174
This review is an analysis by an ICU clinician of the different points of view of these syndromes and intends to give a global vision of the numerous factors implied, emphasizing the complex interactions between them.	0.5979587479037232
The present state about new potential treatments directed on mediators is summarized.	0.3626975165780385
The aim of the study was to evaluate if a combined physiologic-therapeutic scoring system (MARIS = Marburger Intensive Score) offers better outcome prediction compared to scoring systems, which are based either only physiologically (APACHE II = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) or only therapeutically (TISS = Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System) in medical intensive care medicine.	0.6916569795842701
Main outcome parameters employed were hospital mortality, severity of disease classification and length of hospital stay.	0.49848754833373693
During a 12-months period (1993/94), 531 consecutive patients (ICU stay >4 hours) being admitted to a medical ICU of a tertiary care university hospital were prospectively investigated.	0.5886383426359942
The day-1-scores of MARIS, APACHE II, and TISS were determined and the patients were followed until hospital discharge or death.	0.7607622532006897
There was no advantage in using the combined scoring system (MARIS) neither in discrimination between survival and non-survival (hospital mortality; areas under the ROC-curve: MARIS = 0.84, APACHE II = 0.86, TISS = 0.78) nor in severity classification (relationship between day-1-scores and hospital mortality: p<0.001 (chi2-Test) in all three systems).	0.6251528308658243
In contrast only for the combined system (MARIS), a dependence of length of hospital stay from day-1-scores in the analysis of survivors only and in the analysis of all patients (survivors and non-survivors) (p<0.001; ANOVA) could be demonstrated.	0.7159230909054296
In conclusion the combined physiologic-therapeutic scoring system (MARIS) did not offer a better outcome prediction concerning hospital mortality and severity classification compared to the established systems in critically ill patients.	0.5338615094890664
Its use may be advantageous in evaluating the relationship between day-1-scores and length of hospital stay, which for economical reasons has become a parameter of growing interest in intensive care medicine.	0.656354463962202
A 23 month old boy was admitted to hospital because of anemia, mainly truncal rash and unclear pain.	0.4836867741655136
Previously he had shown fever, conjunctivitis and desquamations of hands and feet.	0.30844974516490037
Laboratory findings were moderate leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, anemia, and an elevation of ESR and gamma-globulins.	0.5968465257222484
No bacterial infection was found.	0.24395594697511305
The ECG showed signs of a myocardial ischemia.	0.6694045659018262
The sonography of the heart detected an aneurysm of the left coronary artery.	0.73819110851334
The boy died of a sudden cardiac arrest.	0.46733216744486117
The autopsy verified the diagnosis of Kawasaki-syndrome and revealed two coronary aneurysms blocked by thrombosis and a necrotic panarteriitis.	0.4616310865690162
The etiology of the painful hip in children is widespread.	0.5658602116172049
In this paper, predominants cases without previous trauma are discussed in detail.	0.5338270905255669
Depending on age, history, clinical picture and laboratory results, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is presented, which should avoid unnecessary tests and lead to the necessary therapeutic measure.	0.798189548335139
Several common as well as uncommon clinical entities are illustrated by representative examples.	0.38219411998744957
The present study exemplifies the method of quantitative reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) by quantifying, in bovine tissues, the specific mRNAs for the two key proteins which regulate cellular cholesterol metabolism, the low density lipoprotein (LDL) -receptor and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase.	0.7181495568340426
Our data reveal a broad range of expression for both mRNAs.	0.38561929261978595
The LDL-receptor mRNA expression was highest in the adrenal gland (6.7 x 104 molecules/ug cellular RNA) followed by the corpus luteum of the ovary, intermediate in the liver (8.6 x 102 molecules/ug cellular RNA) and not detectable in the large intestine.	0.6045742544987964
Expression of the HMG-CoA reductase almost paralleled LDL-receptor values.	0.41220487268859
It was found to be highest in the ovary (6.1 x 106 molecules/ug cellular RNA) followed by the adrenal gland, intermediate in the liver (3.1 x 105 molecules/ug cellular RNA) and lowest in the large intestine (9.9 x 104 molecules/ug cellular RNA).	0.6478345365829532
These data are consistent with other reports concerning the quantitative analysis of the expression of both proteins as determined by other experimental approaches.	0.5337044609631757
Thus cRT-PCR is a valuable tool for the quantitative analysis of the LDL-receptor and the HMG-CoA reductase.	0.5815935729303128
Spinal opioids are effective analgesics for surgical and non-surgical pain.	0.4002116824023246
Central and systemic side effects are less frequent than with epidural local anaesthetics or parenteral opioids.	0.5544780738987289
This review focuses on the analgesic efficacy of spinal opioids and their combination with local anaesthetics for postoperative analgesia, including patient-controlled epidural analgesia.	0.6462301376259484
Intrathecal administration of opioids has some advantages over their administration by the epidural route.	0.4320864420481404
Several factors may influence selection of the opioid; however, in most situations morphine is the drug of choice.	0.6107958738609787
Thoracic epidural administration of opioids seems to have no clinically important advantages over the lumbar route in terms of quality of analgesia, adverse effects, doses required or pulmonary function.	0.5597301295673818
However, evidence suggesting that effective postoperative analgesia can significantly improve postoperative morbidity in patients at risk is accumulating.	0.6138065455316977
In such patients, combined use of epidural local anaesthetics and opioids may become the technique of choice for postoperative analgesia.	0.759715277394914
However, there is no evidence that this would have any clinically relevant benefit in low-risk patients.	0.7671460022280502
This contribution summarizes a discussion of several experts on the field of clinical nutrition, which was held in Evangelische Akademie Loccum, Germany, May 20-21, 1998.	0.6060171409063325
Nutrition can be considered a medical treatment, which justifies assessment of benefits according to outcome parameters.	0.6412611266046145
With regard to nutritional support of the cancer patient, evaluation of quality of life (QL) is more appropriate than morbidity and survival related parameters.	0.646179908279048
Quality of life is a multidimensional construct which can be measured by standardized questionnaires.	0.6340812929159281
The QL Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), is an established and validated instrument which provides reliable information with regard to disease-related limitations of QL.	0.7343957101335419
The measurement of QL can be extended by appropriate modules for specific problems according to the underlying cancer disease and special therapies (e.g., percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy).	0.49375915202862525
In the individual case, the interpretation of the role of nutritional parameters for QL may be confounded by other parameters, such as disease or personal changes.	0.5861130881947076
However, the information supports decision making about the indication, the route of nutritional therapy, as well as individual follow-up.	0.651681623740709
Using QL as an outcome parameter, carefully designed prospective trials might be feasible in order to investigate the outcome of nutritional therapy in patients with advanced cancer.	0.6096516580737501
The inclusion of a control group is questionable from the ethical viewpoint.	0.4201058487719339
The treatment of distal fractures of the lower arm can be conservative or operative.	0.7422387000598165
The immediate aims of any treatment are anatomical realignment and the avoidance of trophic impairments, with the ultimate objective of unrestricted function of the hand and wrist.	0.6203279694289744
A graduated treatment scheme based on the ASIF classification is necessary to do justice to the different forms of fracture that can occur.	0.6183644832792318
The majority of injuries can still be successfully treated by conservative means; operative treatment becomes more important when there are signs of unusually high levels of instability or joint involvement.	0.5966771476907456
The authors' own patient population is presented in this paper: in these patients fixation with Kirschner wires has proved to be the most successful of the operative procedures used, followed by palmar plate fixation with or without cancellous bone plasty, and for C-type fractures according to the ASIF classification or when there is severe soft-tissue damage, application of a fixateur externe spanning the joint has proved best.	0.7224741511465272
Treatment strategy, risks, complications and results are presented.	0.5923664485785639
Many couples have to cope with periods of involuntary childlessness and they often ask for medical help.	0.3666515861987065
In the Heidelberg Project of involuntary childlessness in men, andrological patients were surveyed from the time before diagnosis till the end of 1 year's andrological treatment.	0.49723182728017407
Cardiac complications remain an important cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality with noncardiac surgery, despite improvement in surgical techniques and anaesthetic management.	0.5679180483557846
Therefore preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment plays a pivotal role in management of patients prior to noncardiac surgery.	0.4289428136140609
Thorough history-taking and careful examination are essential to consider further diagnostic steps in order to predict the patient's individual perioperative cardiac risk as accurately as possible.	0.5926453744831032
Besides elaboration of medical therapy, cardiac catherization and even balloon angioplasty or bypass surgery must be considered if indicated by preoperative cardiac testing.	0.5693860816588416
According to the literature, chronic ankle instability occurs after acute rupture of the lateral ankle ligaments in 10-20 % of the cases.	0.7397375926438153
The etiology of the instability are ligamentous damage and functional neuromuscular disorder of the peroneal muscles.	0.5997075285250165
The standards of diagnostics are the history with the frequency of inversion trauma per period and the interval from the primary trauma, the clinical examination and radiological stress tests.	0.7443303156877961
Newer diagnostic methods, up to now not well established in clinical routine, include stabilometry, cybex-measurements of the pronator muscles, the evaluation of peroneal reaction time on a tilting platform and dynamic pedography.	0.587201036786608
Conservative management of chronic ankle instability consists of wearing ankle braces and rehabilitation programs concerned with peroneal muscle strengthening and coordination training.	0.38264997688225205
The indication for surgical reconstruction of the ankle ligaments are a well-documented mechanical instability with the neuromuscular reflexes intact and a failed physiotherapeutic training program.	0.6330432459422898
The surgical procedure should be selected according to a priority list: 1. anatomical repair, eventually augmented with periosteum from the fibula, 2.	0.6949648710448777
Watson-Jones tenodesis, and 3.	0.516762131952087

No other disease has exhibited such a significant influence on the behaviour of health care workers (HCW) as the AIDS pandemic.	0.6766494245116051
Numerous epidemiological data, however, have proven that the overall risk of transmission of the human deficiency virus (HIV) during surgical interventions is low; it is 0.3 % for all types of percutaneous exposures.	0.78017542412002
Nevertheless, there still is a need for wider adoption of safer surgical techniques to reduce the chances of HIV transmission in the operation theatre, which additionally minimize the risk of transmission of other blood-borne pathogens.	0.6936042540770876
In the case of occupational exposure to HIV-contaminated blood or body secretions post-exposure prophylaxis should be recommended stratified by the type of exposure and source material.	0.47037159047854
Abstract   Pachyonychia congenita (PC) comprises a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited conditions showing characteristic nail thickening and associated signs such as palmoplantar keratoderma, follicular keratoses, and mucosal leukokeratoses.	0.4242559002430447
Less frequently epidermal cysts, hairshaft abnormalities, natal teeth and laryngeal involvement may be seen.	0.38273568146270276
Phenotypically and genetically two major forms of PC are recognized, pachyonychia congenita Jadassohn- Lewandowsky/PC type I (Medelian inheritance in man - MIM - 167200) and pachyonychia congenita Jackson-Lawler/PC type II (MIM 167210).	0.4947180918716144
Both conditions show nail deformities, focal palmoplantar keratoderma, and follicular hyperkeratoses.	0.5228721122106487
Diagnostically relevant are leukokeratoses of the oral mucosa in patients with PC type I.	0.5587386901022869
In contrast individuals affected with PC type II show premature dentition and multiple pilosebaceous cysts predominantely affecting the upper trunk.	0.3636764820286755
The latter closely resemble eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex.	0.23367789970613032
By mutational analysis keratin K6a and K16 gene mutations have been detected in patients with PC type I, and keratin K6b and K17 gene mutations have been shown to be the underlying genetic defect in patients with PC type II.	0.572296623585627
We investigated the incidence of postoperative chest tube bleeding, administration of blood products, and changes in coagulation tests in patients with diltiazem (DIL) administration for reduction of myocardial ischemic episodes during elective CABG.	0.6272343191313415
We retrospectively analyzed the surgical and ICU records of CABG patients who had recieved DIL (27 pats.)	0.538791486096872
or nitroglycerin (NTG; 26 pats.)	0.2829340946815074
or a combination thereof (COM; 25 pats.).	0.3571660560979155
Data investigated included the amount of postoperative chest tube bleeding (CTB), frequency of administration of packed red blood cells (RBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and changes in hemoglobin (Hb), thrombocyte (Th) levels as well as changes in prothrombin- (PT) and partial thromboplastine time (PTT).	0.6021226829997111
There were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to biometrical or operative data.	0.5764116100401205
The amount of CTB as well as the use of RBC and FFP were not significantly different between the groups.	0.5256833885445538
Also, there were no significant differences with regard to Hb or Th and PT or PTT, both in the early phase after the operation in ICU as well as after 24 hours in the ICU.	0.7990819590038212
The perioperative administration of the calcium entery blocker DIL reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia during CABG surgery.	0.5406752033211243
This administration during CABG surgery does not increase the risk of postoperative bleeding.	0.45701549937280916
As compared to NTG, DIL does not have negative effects on Hb and Th levels or the commonly used coagulation parameters in the first 24 hours in the ICU after CABG surgery.	0.5674638989117057
Depression and fibromyalgia (FM) share common symptoms, indicating a close relationship between both disorders.	0.4538657491557651
FM patients frequently present symptoms of major depression.	0.3081931357773157
Genetic epidemiological studies show that genetic transmission is one important component.	0.39259702069348146
Molecular genetic studies are on the way; the serotonin transporter promoter gene seems to be associated with neurotic anxiety and FM.	0.5111998953416981
Biochemical studies related to the serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission are disturbed in both disorders.	0.4128234070104516
This view is supported by the response to treatment with antidepressants.	0.6477564698999415
At our hospital, closed dislocations of the elbow without neurovascular or osseous lesion are treated conservatively after successful reduction in the absence of a tendency to redislocation.	0.6870820495198814
Indications for surgery are irreducible dislocations and those with a tendency to redislocation as well as open soft tissue injuries, neurovascular and osseous concomitant injuries.	0.6125929436615641
During a period of 10 years 113 patients were treated according to this strategy.	0.6580144944812089
Of these patients, 46 had simple dislocations of the elbow and 67 suffered from dislocations with osseous lesions.	0.5823356130889012
In 95 patients follow-ups could be performed after a mean period of 55 months.	0.6609424857500525
In more than 75 % of cases good or excellent functional results were documented; unfavourable results were seen only in patients with osseous lesions.	0.736118395892782
Nearly all of the patients had a stable elbow joint at the end of therapy.	0.8696274629485348
The present study investigated the frequency and influencing factors of petechial bleeding (PET) in the conjunctivae and eyelids in different causes of death except strangulation.	0.6564976608127328
In a series of 473 autopsies the over all occurrence of PET was 13.3%.	0.44949608481786996
The highest frequencies were found in fire victims (31%), persons who had died after intensive care (24%), cardiac death (22%), drowning and intoxication (16% each).	0.6367709110826448
The frequency of PET decreased with increasing age and increased with the body mass.	0.6127843771557087
At first sight cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) seemed to influence the occurrence of PET, because the rate was 11% without and 19% with CPR (x2: p < 0.05); an aspect which has been mentioned in the literature.	0.5870783982123732
However, further analysis showed that a higher rate of PET could only be observed in causes of death where PET are often fround irrespective of CPR, whereas in the other groups PET (with or without CPR) are uncommon.	0.8208039016909958
Furthermore, a case-by-case analysis showed that in several cases with PET after CPR the causes could clearly be attributed to conditions other than CPR.	0.6676074263827728
In a second series of autopsy cases with only cardiac deaths (181 cases), the influence of age and body mass on the rate of PET was statistically significant and there was a tendency for more frequent PET with increasing heart weight.	0.6622356130952072
On the other hand, no statistically significant influence of CPR on the rate of PET could be found in this relatively homogeneous group.	0.6639617165476877
Media reports convey the impression that the incidence of fatal accidents in the European Alps has been increasing yearly at an alarming rate.	0.43017035323873226
Although objective data is lacking, the annual reports of the mountain rescue services in Germany, Austria, the southern Tirol, Switzerland and the Chamonix region in France were analysed with respect to the fatal and non-fatal accidents which occurred between 1987 and 1997.	0.5626887915467161
Because of varying definitions of "mountain accident" used in these countries, available data about the number of fatalities are not comparable.	0.5368674568163618
A 75-year-old man had painless, slowly enlarging tumors in the right and left infrascapular regions.	0.7034080910912073
Clinically, the tumors were nontender and semimobile.	0.5604232150371102
MR imaging and the operative exploration revealed tumors infiltrating the lateral thoracic muscles and periost of the scapula and underlying ribs.	0.4291630895218638
At surgery, the tumors were thought to be malignant, most likely liposarcomas.	0.7630395215436839
The histological examination showed the characteristic appearance of elastofibromas with spindle-shaped fibroblasts, which were separated by thick eosinophilic collagenous and elastic fibers.	0.5913321757061836
Elastofibromas are benign mesenchymal soft-tissue lesions that mainly affect elderly women.	0.34276517205857654
In 10 % of the patients bilateral, often asynchronous tumors are seen.	0.749353875890132
Ninety-nine percent of the lesions are located in the subscapular region.	0.5885321622109181
Occasional elastofibromas have been described in the extremities, head, and in the abdominal and thoracic cavities.	0.9849408577388081
The relative success of thrombolytic versus surgical therapy of thrombus in transit has not yet been evaluated in clinical studies.	0.5983865079447453
Only case reports of one or more patients exist.	0.6563207038330193
Optimal therapy, therefore, remains controversial, and conclusive recommendations in favor of one choice of therapy over the other cannot be given.	0.5497237872601707
Nevertheless, in current practice thrombolysis as a noninvasive and quickly available form of therapy is preferred, if no contraindications exist.	0.7381621487799177
Two cases are presented together with a literature review.	0.6638920480040701
The Comèl-Netherton syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease.	0.5604805692868289

Autologous platelet concentrates contain many growth factors to stimulate glial wound healing.	0.29396968916074884
In vitro fertilisation IVF and intrazytoplasmic sperm injection ICSI are the most commonly used methods of assisted reproduction.	0.5085128730886712
Whereas classic indications for both treatment options are widely accepted, for example severe tubal damage which cannot be microsurgically repaired, cryptozoospermia, severe OAT syndrome and repeated failure of fertilisation in normal IVF, ICSI might be indicated in a wider range of indications as well.	0.5275813853939607
In this paper a number of additional ICSI indications are defined, for example minor forms of andrological subfertility, reinsemination of nonfertilised oocytes on the day after conventional IVF, reduced motility of cryopreserved sperms, reduced quality of oocytes or ICSI after one cycle of unexplained fertilisation failure in IVF.	0.5583372688050182
Load on the human body can be influenced by shoes and surfaces which is important both in sports and rehabilitation.	0.6053527715540968
The loading which can primarily be influenced are impact situations and friction as well as the stability of the foot.	0.4357900103825492
This stability is of main interest in the prevention of pain and injury.	0.5452641354918598
However, a certain amount of loading is necessary to improve strength and structure of biological materials.	0.7216901391936219
In the past, the development of shoe and surface materials has hardly been perceived under this aspect, but may be increasingly important in the future.	0.672465521870169
With optimal clinical management of patients with Marfan syndrome, life expectancy may be improved substantially from 32 years to a nearly normal life span.	0.6025786296831391
Cornerstones of clinical management comprise genetic counseling, life-style management, and cardiovascular surveillance, which includes regular aortic imaging and endocarditis prophylaxis.	0.6195412559121486
Prophylactic use of beta-blocking agents as well as timing of elective surgery and the choice of the optimal surgical technique are difficult issues that obviously need to be individualized.	0.5598959231057381
Juvenile or postoperative patients as well as pregnant patients with Marfan syndrome pose particular problems.	0.3679726446752987
This review intends both to facilitate differential decision making based on referenced evidence and to provide guidelines for therapeutic strategies.	0.4263099602108309

In Germany, good clinical multicenter studies that are not supported by pharmaceutical companies are rarely performed.	0.5152301172139284
Good supranational industry-sponsored studies are usually aimed at the registration of new (expensive) drugs.	0.38333626351097166
The preconditions for co-operation in conducting industry-independent studies which are of interest for the scientific community have been improved substantially in Germany by instituting the working group of co-operating arthritis centers, the so-called core documentation where 32000 patients with rheumatic conditions were documented in 1997 and the institution of a sophisticated information system ("RheumaNet").	0.5827299397608228
The executive board of the German Rheumatology Association has set up an "ad hoc commission" that agreed to institute a "Committee for the Coordination of Clinical Studies in Rheumatic Diseases".	0.5459225932027693
In this committee rheumatologists subspecialized from medicine, orthopedic, pediatrics working in universities, hospitals and private practice as well as specialists in statistics and epidemiology shall be represented.	0.4726195889343625
In principle this committee is independent of the co-operating arthritis centers and the RheumaNet.	0.3966677573006423
All members of the German Rheumatology Association are invited to cooperate with this committee by contributing to the clinically important questions and participating in clinical studies.	0.5076527294161806
The committee has to define key questions in rheumatology and shall plan and organize multicenter studies to answer these questions.	0.3489780623433343
In addition, study protocols of pharmaceutical companies may be examined as to their importance, quality, and feasibility.	0.5487893581425601
Abnormal uterine bleeding is a gynecological problem frequently seen in women from adolescence to the postmenopausal period.	0.4375928735139421
Nearly 70% of patients' visits to the gynecologist in the peri- and postmenopausal period are due to abnormal uterine bleeding.	0.6812987039617993
According to the "speed"-hypothesis of cognitive development, the slowing of information processing in old age is at the core of negative age differences in psychometric intelligence.	0.6207580220645502
The present study investigates the "speed"-hypothesis for fluid intelligence at the individual level using Latent Growth Curve Methodology.	0.6432983138749025
Date on 4 measurement points come from the Bonn Longitudinal Study of aging (N=128, mean age 67.2, 53% women).	0.500250926746901
Based on principal factor analysis, markers of mental speed were the WAIS Digit Symbol Test and simple psychomotor task.	0.4047981739552746
As indicators of fluid intelligence the WAIS Object Assembly and Block Design were used.	0.3287247664272062
After separately fitting Latent Growth Curve Models for the trajectory of mental speed and fluid intelligence, a combined model showed no statistically significant improvement of fit for freeing the covariance between the two slope-factors.	0.547947173030626
Interpreting this result, contrary to the "speed"-hypothesis the intraindividual change of fluid intelligence does not relate to the according change of mental speed.	0.48865675681799114
For patients with dilative cardiomyopathy (DCM), the prognosis is highly unfavorable, even under conditions of optimal medication.	0.6985744860794267
At present, there is no option for causal therapy.	0.5527261555852115
Since there is increasing evidence that modifications of the immune system accompanied by the production of autoantibodies, e.g., against 1 ad-renergic or muscarinergic receptors, are involved in the pathogenesis of DCM, the elucidation of the possible functional significance of these autoantibodies has attracted increasing interest.	0.5845231545975214
In addition to the role of autoantibodies as markers for an autoimmune process, discussion of the possible pathogenetic mechanisms has centered on direct toxicity as well as on negative influencing of myocardial contractility and energy metabolism.	0.5877094092316911
The effects gained through removal of autoantibodies by immunoadsorption therapy for DCM patients sheds light on the functional importance of autoantibodies in this syndrome.	0.4160866734485164
The principle of this form of therapy is based on the binding of circulating antibodies to sepharose columns, to which polyclonal antibodies against human immunoglobulin are linked.	0.6198035143559643
A pilot study conducted among DCM patients disclosed that immunadsorption took place in simultaneous conjunction with a reduction in the immunoglobulin level and with significant hemodynamic and clinical improvement.	0.5308793221297723
These results may be interpreted as indicating that autoantibodies play an active role in DCM and that their removal by immunadsorption possibly represents a highly promising future therapeutic concept.	0.4311565360658758
Active unspecific immunotherapy in an adjuvant or palliative setting has been shown to enhance survival in melanoma patients, and gene therapy now offers new perspectives for active specific immunotherapy.	0.5140326679163268
Gene therapy includes the transfer of genetic material performed by either viral or non-viral methods and in vivo or ex vivo.	0.5249260139135012
For melanoma the following approaches are suggested: vaccination with tumour-specific, HLA-associated antigens using peptides or `naked DNA', vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with cytokine genes or B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T-lymphocytes or transfected tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of tumour cells with a tumour suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a crucial role in melanoma.	0.4644856607999303
Since 1995, a total of 115 patients with pseudarthrosis or delayed bone fracture healing have each undergone a single session of shock wave treatment.	0.471991424782284
After the treatment the fractures were correctly set according to the rules of conservative bone fracture treatment.	0.6295804469649162
The mean follow-up period for all patients was 31 months (range 3-50 months.	0.7904253958301327
In 87 cases (75.7%) bony consolidation was achieved with simultaneous reduction in the symptoms.	0.6450061434671908
Apart from low-grade local reactions (swelling, haematoma, petechiae) no complications were observed.	0.538045355733971
The treatment is noninvasive and requires little investment in terms of personnel or technology.	0.45107649561710195
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy should therefore be considered before an elaborate operative procedure is initiated in the treatment of pseudarthrosis and of delayed fracture healing.	0.5420681685180416
The sound transmission properties of three different commercially available middle ear implants and the prototype of a complete middle ear prosthesis (CoMEP) were evaluated with a special measurement system that permits standardized conditions.	0.6720614195480166
This system uses a mechanical middle ear model (MMM) which approximates the impedances of the tympanic membrane and inner ear.	0.48360467668209467
The implants were fitted under defined conditions into the MMM.	0.4010700559302578
Displacement of the artificial stapes footplate of the MMM was measured with an optical probe.	0.5814601476351254
The measurements of different middle ear prostheses showed that the mass of the implant was the most important factor for optimum high frequency transmission.	0.753958602243853
The lightest implant (4 mg, titanium) showed the best results.	0.8300712607214257
The CoMEP revealed the highest sensitivity because of a slight enlargement of the diameter of the artificial tympanic membrane.	0.6067963176703028
These findings show that the CoMEP is able to restore sound transmission to a normal range.	0.5607089253751897
In a second experiment one of the implants was fitted into the MMM with different forces.	0.7054443874610945
The increase of stiffness produced a slightly better high frequency transmission at the expense of low frequency sensitivity.	0.50833269755405
Hence, the fitting of the implant may not be too stiff because of its loss of mobility within a significant frequency range.	0.6373587107885615
Angiomyolipomas are hamartomas that may be found sporadically or associated with tuberous sclerosis (M. Bourneville-Pringle).	0.4928155500773927
Clinically, this long-term asymptomatic tumor becomes evident as an acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage or by symptoms of a flank mass.	0.643383675409145
Due to the high percentage of fat components in this tumor type, computed tomography is far superior to other radiological procedures.	0.6148732098717243
In view of two of our own case reports, the therapeutic strategies are discussed, paying regard to the actual literature in this field.	0.8925254071613021
The excact pathogenesis of Peyronie's Disease (PD) is still unknown.	0.5608027566063872
Histopathological investigations suggest, that the metabolism of the collogenious tissue plays an important role.	0.6174330367822776
Therefore, we started a prospective study in order to evaluate the metabolic situation of 11 patients with PD and 11 healthy controls.	0.7988756856638353
We mesured biochemical parameters of penile and venous blood, wich correspond to the collagen metabolism (procollagen III [P III P], PMN-elastase [PMN-E], fibronectin [FN], fibronectinreceptor [FN-R] und -1-proteinase-inhibitor [-1-PI]).	0.5466433364390805
There was no difference in PMN-E, P III P, FN and FN-R in all samples.	0.6055296655133732
There was no difference in penile and venous blood as well.	0.534629940827117
But we found out a highly significant lower concentration of -1-PI in patients with PD (158,55 mg/dl) than in controls (214,82 mg/dl).	0.7070680538249743
Closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon is rare.	0.6134744264540414
Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature, perhaps because the symptoms are often neglected by the patient as well as by the doctor.	0.7562310376467158
Most often the rupture occurs as a consequence of a sudden plantar flexion of the ankle and pre-existing degenerative changes of the tendon tissue due to systemic disease or iatrogenic local corticoid injections.	0.6914122184893841
Clinically, the tendon rupture presents as acute weakness of the ankle extensors without reddening, swelling or neurological signs.	0.5743913334210768
Differential diagnoses such as anterior tibial syndrome and peroneal nerve palsy can thus be excluded.	0.45125066200689457
During the clinical examination the distal stump and the discontinuity of the anterior tibial tendon are often palpable.	0.6624991908733687
The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by an ultrasound examination.	0.6340811636799163
An operation may be undertaken up to 3 months after the injury.	0.6222593720457397
Preferred procedures are end-to-end anastomosis and transosseous refixation of the tendon, followed by a plaster cast for 6 weeks postoperatively.	0.6284970388354572
High-risk patients can be treated conservatively, but the functional results are less satisfactory.	1.0473382267083238
We describe a case of an acute closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon.	0.8981777240556575
A yet unpublished method of osseous reinsertion of the tendon is presented.	0.517022043029666
In this four-part review article, an update of Psychological Gerontology since 1988 in German speaking countries is given.	0.46826770947785684
Part II of this review focuses an personality development in old age.	0.5985634500565218
In accordance with their current relevance within research on personality development, concepts and empirical studies concerned with coping, psychological resilience and development regulation in old age are addressed in the first part of this review (contributions to basic research).	0.6104888573578172
First, research based on the two-process-model of coping, the personality theory of Thomae and the life-span theory of control is summarized.	0.643828258838049
Next, work on subjective well-being, self and self-regulation are highlighted.	0.5809119783623937
In the second part of the review (contribution to applied research), an overview of the scope of potential of psychotherapeutic intervention in old age is given.	0.7071091696479703
Background: According to literature, 30-60 % of pacemaker patients suffer from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).	0.6754330368229534
As rapid tracking of PAF may cause severe symptoms in patients with dual chamber pacemakers, refined algorithms providing AV synchronous pacing during periods of sinus rhythm and preventing high ventricular rates during PAF are highly desirable.	0.4624519043546796
Aim and method: This comprehensive paper introduces a new mode switching (MS) algorithm which uses either a fixed (Inos2CLS) or programmable (Logos) number of short intervals out of 8 consecutive atrial intervals to detect PAF.	0.4710913606645842
If the MS criterion is fulfilled, a switch from AV synchronous pacing to nontracking mode is automatically performed.	0.46776136655358075
The algorithm is described together with a discussion on optimization of the programming of parameters which may indirectly influence the MS sensitivity and specificity.	0.526952426940654
Results: This MS concept maintains the high sensitivity and fast reactivity towards PAF of the "mode conversion" in Actros and Kairos pacemaker systems, preventing a long time delay between onset of PAF, detection of the arrhythmia, and switch to nontracking mode.	0.636641578341704
In addition, adequeate sensing and short blanking periods in the new MS concept enable reliable MS.	0.33932131911818797
The occurrence of atrial oversensing should be tested, as it may lead to inappropriate MS. Programmability of the MS algorithm may be advantageous for individual programming with respect to the patients' arrhythmia rate and atrial sensing performance, but the use of very restrictive or very liberal criteria should be avoided as both may lead to mode oscillations.	0.6753872865014175
Finally, examples of stored diagnostic data are presented to assess MS reliability, identify possible problems, and optimize MS function during follow-up.	0.5301211023412156
Purpose: To evaluate MR imaging at 1.5 Tesla in patients suffering from acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) using proton-density weighted (PDW) fast spin echo (FSE) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences.	0.5769742665945218

Introduction: Coronary arterty disease still remains the primary cause of death in the western industrialized world.	0.596119267409724
Although the clinical value of selective coronary angiography (SCA) is beyond dispute, the associated risk of an invasive approach, the inherent costs and the necessary hospitalization have lead to the development and investigation of novel non-invasive techniques for coronary imaging.	0.7270756920945981
Intravenous coronary angiography (ICA) has been shown to permit non-invasive imaging of the coronary arteries.	0.6517209515921732
We report nine case histories of patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital for severe somatic disorders.	0.4912274425100685
The somatic disease was either the cause of the psychiatric symptomatology, or it occurred in addition to a well-known psychiatric disorder.	0.7435884559280712
For general practitioners and psychiatrists it can be difficult to differentiate between symptoms due to psychiatric disorders and symptoms that indicate somatic disorders.	0.5459789008932997
If patients refuse the necessary diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and show behaviour that is not related to good health, there is increased risk for complications and increased morbidity.	0.6590986785416884
Penetrating neck injuries are potentially life-threatening injuries.	0.4571004089129403

The Outcome-questionnaire, rating patient's complaints and the functional status based on the severity-symptom scale and functional status described for Carpaltunnel-syndrome by Levine et al.	0.5447094060988728
c. The clinical rating system (CRS) described by Kitaoka et al.	0.703553762000583
The statistical evaluation was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA).	0.5032332592620183
Level of significance was based on P = 0.05 and calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficient.	0.5494303074763028
The Os calcis fracture was the cause for the subtalar arthritis in all 40 patients (33 males and 7 females).	0.6248567659021206
The primary treatment of the calcaneal fracture was conservative (cons.)	0.48207759938266725
using a plaster in 23 patients (57.5 %), while 17 patients (42.5 %) underwent open reduction and plate fixation (op.).	0.6986068668423469
The interval between trauma and subtalar fusion averaged 3.5 years (3 months to 20 years).	0.7968258947460952
The interval between subtalar fusion and follow-up averaged 5.2 years (4-14 years).	0.7203772276470678
The mean age at the time of reexamination was 47 years (26-61 years).	0.612959531559068
In the present study, complete pain relief could be achieved in 21 (52.5 %; 58 % op., 50 % cons.)	0.6965848299808454
A relevant restriction in the range of motion in the ankle joint was found in 26 (65 %; 76 % op., 58 % cons.).	0.722519381267083
In 23 patients (62 %; 65 % op., 59 % cons.)	0.5767571001378972
the radiological evaluation revealed a grade 1  ° arthritis of the ankle joint, in the talonavicular joint in 17 patients (42.5 %; 41 % op., 45 % cons.	0.7047299845415846
), and in the calcaneo-cuboid joint in 14 patients (35 %; 47 %., 27 % cons.).	0.8626793142956972
The statistical analysis revealed a better outcome in the operative group compared with the conservative group, although the operated os calcis fractures in the majority were the more severe fracture types.	0.9156332801123481
In all evaluation systems a score between 61 and 69 points could be achieved with no significant difference between the operatively and conservatively treated groups and between the newly developed questionaire and the clinical-radiological scoring systems.	0.6128587725318645
For the questionaire this fulfills the requirements for a reliable outcome evaluation.	0.3821259612994765
Objectives Correction of an overriding fifth toe.	0.3346058972438873
Non-palpable breast-lesions like microcalcifications often fail an exact diagnosis.	0.4055568309558431
Accurate treatment is difficult by conventional marking and operating procedures since freehand positionin of al localization wire is often suboptimal.	0.3572831381516901
The consequences are larger tissue-defects leading to an insufficient cosmetic result.	0.4092022712737632
Nevertheless, resection of microcalcifications by conventional surgery remains sometimes incomplete.	0.46444385379657
Digital mammography coupled with stereotactic biopsy procedures gives more accurate results with minimal invasive techniques.	0.35301497600884985
The advantages and disadvantages of the advanced breast biopsy intstrumentation (ABBI) procedure versus vacuum biopsy systems are summarized and compared.	0.40107899427087085
Either of those systems is highly accepted by the patients due to the outpatient manner of its application and the convincing results regarding sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the methods.	0.7032428210976883
Chondroid syringoma belongs to the group of so-called mixed tumors, like pleomorphic adenomas of the lacrimal and salivary glands.	0.5757959461017
The histogenesis of this tumour is still disputed, in particular with respect to its stromal component.	0.7667619522355348
The distribution of cytokeratins (CKs), CEA, EMA, vimentin, S-100 protein, desmin and actin [-smooth muscle actin (-SMA)] was investigated by immunohistological examination of paraffin sections from a chondroid syringoma of the apocrine type.	0.5932449560602095
The neoplastic formations have been classified into tubuloalveolar structures, solid nests/aggregations and stromal cells of varying morphology.	0.39527597654782826
The innermost cells of tubuloalveolar structures were characterized by marked expression of CKs (KL1 and MNF116), CEA and EMA, while in the outer ones there was moderate expression of vimentin, S-100 was expressed to a lesser extent and KL1, weakly but there was marked and consistent expression of MNF116.	0.5044574179150396
Whereas the solid nests expressed vimentin, S-100 protein, MNF116 markedly and KL1 weakly, the stromal cells were consistently positive for vimentin, S-100 protein and, focally, CKs and -SMA.	0.5576414106180114
Anti--SMA specifically detects myoepithelial cells.	0.20643416211617563
In addition, the partly overlapping immunoreactivity of the intermediate filaments, membrane proteins and proteins in the different structures may indicate a common clonal origin of all neoplastic cells in chondroid syringoma.	0.4679977104461238
Leg ulcers may be caused by many different diseases.	0.35840856210221583
Most frequently, they are due to vasculopathies, to a lesser extent to metabolic, neuropathic or hematologic diseases.	0.6162574150510604
Neoplasms, connective tissue diseases, infections, trauma, and panniculitis should also be included in the differential diagnosis.	0.5540715163724489
A 38-year-old Caucasian female patient with hereditary prolidase deficiency developed progressive and very painful leg ulcers.	0.4900317674345394
The ulcers first appeared in childhood and did not respond to various treatments.	0.5290991548946147
Additional features of prolidase deficiency included mental retardation, short stature, extensive dental caries, and multiple malar teleangiectases.	0.514223671125054
Hereditary prolidase deficiency is a very rare autosomal recessive disease.	0.5348083097441783
It is caused by heterogeneous mutations of the prolidase gene and affects many aspects of protein metabolism.	0.38647328980949575
Ion exchange chromatography and high voltage electrophoresis of urine can prove the suspected diagnosis.	0.29232197366049484
So far, there is no efficient therapy for hereditary prolidase deficiency.	0.5227979721056905
All reported treatment attempts have ended in failure.	0.21260041441528232
In this paper the basic features of acute, subacute and chronic types of osteomyelitis, skeletal tuberculosis and some special forms of osteomyelitis are described.	0.6381668464966421
The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is established using clinical signs and symptoms, culture studies, laboratory studies and radiological signs.	0.6342154225528609
The common conservative and surgical treatments are discussed.	0.4243412320700495
In the treatment of post-traumatic/postoperative osteitis severe problems are encountered as a result of an increasing number of orthopaedic traumatologic surgical techniques using a variety of implants and because of a generally increasing occurrence of multiresistant strains.	0.5644222316352385
Thanks to modern treatment and the increased use of antibiotics, a considerable decrease in morbidity and mortality is observed.	0.7346947156059648
Despite this improved prognosis, an established infection remains one of the most challenging problems for the orthopaedic surgeon.	0.675101748983921
Besides an exponential growth in possibilities for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention in reproductive medicine and genetics, the synergistic effects of modern health technologies have led to the necessity of fast transfer of knowledge into the public domain in order to develop a common social consensus.	0.635884559405215
Thus, physicians and scientists have enormous obligations not only for the development of medical technology but also of medical and societal ethics.	0.5681540195478726
Very early, i. e. in 1984, the German Medical Association developed professional laws for reproductive medicine.	0.6887245798294113
In addition, the German government saw the need in 1990 for an "Embryo Protection Law" (Embryonenschutzgesetz).	0.5999771100089425
Today, in the light of European integration, the medical profession's and state's obligations are challenged in different ways.	0.6488278487223758
Whereas the German Medical Association continuously works on professional guidelines for reproductive medicine and genetics - currently the case with preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the government must develop the sociolegal framework for ethically sound reproductive medicine, i. e. , in the areas of inheritance law, adoption law, family law, and law of succession, the latter especially in the case of discrepancies between genetic vs. social paternity in heterologous insemination.	0.6595817663748591
In Crohn's disease, some concomitant neurological illnesses such as cerebral ischemia following arterial or venous thrombosis, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord following malabsorption of vitamin B12 or folic acid, opticus neuropathy, and polyneuropathy have been described.	0.570871953698832
Cerebral vasculitis secondary to Crohn's disease seems to be a very rare phenomenon.	0.8053329030947197
We report on three such cases in three female patients (aged 26, 29, and 61 years).	0.807639087824869
All patients became symptomatic with a hemiparesis; one complained additionally of a speech disorder, headache, and intermittent loss of orientation.	0.5142817715475771
In CT and MRI scans, multiple lesions were detected; cerebral angiography showed multiple stenoses of middle- and large-sized vessels that were compatible with cerebral vasculitis.	0.6021156091492057
Serologic tests concerning vasculitis were inconspicuous at that time.	0.23552811003992039
Under anticoagulation (in two cases) and immunosuppressive therapy, neurologic symptoms disappeared.	0.7486563801412641
In the following 6 to 12 months, no new neurological symptoms appeared.	0.7941010662135884
In two cases, Doppler sonographic controls showed stationary and, in one case, progressive intracranial stenoses.	0.7023323795390973
The serin protease tryptase (ECNr.	0.21908524001504703
3.4.21.59), which is almost exclusively expressed in mast cells, is released by mast cell degranulation in an enzymatically active form together with other mediators, e.g.	0.6223500146260049
histamine, into the extracellular space and the circulation.	0.43130907408508107
The capability of the enzyme to directly stimulate several cell types as well as to cleave polypeptide hormones and to activate pro-enzymes suggests a role for tryptase in inflammatory and tissue-remodeling processes.	0.48499316246324176
Therefore, in the skin, a role of tryptase is suggested not only in mastocytosis and immediate type hypersensitivity reactions, but also in other inflammatory diseases, degenerative or neoplastic conditions as well as in wound healing, where an accumulation and/or activation of mast cells is found.	0.7774581452254812
Extracellular tryptase may be superior to histamine as a parameter for the onset and course of immediate type reactions and as an indicator for the activation of mast cells in other conditions.	0.5705181002331704
Its absence during histamine-liberating reactions may suggest basophil activation.	0.20077699404466076
In addition, tryptase has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for the localization of mast cells in tissues.	0.7562937624747241
Background: Since the development of lacrimal endoscopes with which the mucosa and disorders of the lacrimal drainage system can be examined directly, the choice of surgical technique has changed decisively.	0.7015021188974747
Flexible miniendoscopes can be combined with a laser for the first time, allowing for exact localization of the stenosis and subsequent therapy.	0.6793949763599315
Surgery of tibial plateau fractures with joint involvement (AO classification 41 A1, B1-B3 and C1- C3) makes high demands on traumatological management.	0.4250581298670732
By using modern, minimally invasive operative techniques for juxta-articular fractures, it is possible to prevent soft tissue injuries that might affect the functional result.	0.6639267200673805
The aim of this technique is to achieve the exercise stability obtained with standard procedures.	0.7817313665159412
Arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis not only minimizes the surgical soft tissue trauma, but also enables a precise assessment of the articular surfaces under the operation, as well as the simultaneous treatment of concomitant intra-articular injuries, a particular advantage as compared to conventional operative methods.	0.7234048144264155
From a total of 54 patients with tibial plateau fractures, arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis was performed in 34 patients at our clinic from September 1994 to January 1998.	0.6326279720338015
The follow-up of a total of 17 patients revealed good recoveries when assayed by means of the Lysholm and Delamarter score.	0.6002209339914407
We suggest that arthroscopically assisted, minimally invasive osteosynthesis can also be used in selected patients for the treatment of AO classification 41 C1-C3 fractures.	0.6230934030841391
Dorsal tension band fixation is a wide-spread technique of finger arthrodesis.	0.5018792194713696
When using a resorbable PDS-suture as tension band fixation a costly implant removal is not needed.	0.4184188073755445
Aim of this study is the investigation of the primary stability of this technique in combination with the cup-in-cone-procedure.	0.8915033596491365
Freeze-preserved fingers with thread tension band fixation using the PDS-material (series 1), the same fixating method on formaldehyde preserved fingers (series 3), freeze-preserved fingers with a standard tension band fixating (wire loop, series 2) are load in a four-point-bending in the direction of palmarflexion.	0.5745390267909384
From 6 degrees onwards the wire-tension-system requires a higher torque for bending, but in case of higher torque frequently leads to fracture.	0.544319325971797
The examination shows that the thread-tension-band method by PDS-loop for the stabilisation of finger joint arthrodesis has a sufficient initial stability against bending forces.	0.42594937526065074
Modern medicine has succeeded in achieving enormous technical developments.	0.22692294334274554
One recent highlight has been the introduction of postmortem organ transplantation.	0.40427596253997083
At the same time, serious objections have been raised concerning the radical changes in the cultural conception of the inviolable body.	0.5098376430740107
One major objection arises from the conflict of considering a brain-dead person as dead.	0.38896554903072306
The presence of brain death is a prerequisite for post-mortem organ donation, because only during this phase of dying does the individual quality as dead while the organs, other than the brain, remain viable.	0.6270416976314587
The objection implies scepticism as to the physician's ability to distinguish a dead from a living person.	0.5198833785538357
On the other hand, even the critics must rely on the physician's ability to discriminate, e.g., when to discontinue resuscitation.	0.5901408528507344
The medical community has not found reasons to restrict the definition of irreversible coma 25 years after its first formulation.	0.4936939818661831
It must be clearly recognised that reasons other than medical ones can be decisive for refusing organ donation.	0.33915929567755
One ethical problem is the therapeutic benefit of organ transplantation.	0.41916819279382767
The beneficiary of the treatment is not the donor, but another person, the recipient.	0.9392186636207962
The concept of human dignity does not allow the use of a person fur purposes other than the ones he/she consents to, as Immanuel Kant stated.	0.6000605160870045
Although the human corpse is not a person in the full sense, even if it is protected by the thought of respect for the former person, the life-interest of the organ recipient had to be considered legitimate.	0.744234769509244
The resulting conflict between the respect for the donor and the life-interest of the recipient should be balanced by seeking the donor's consent as far as possible.	0.46464864712742204
The proposed information model seems adequate at the moment.	0.3858473898768261
A common report of both churches in Germany in 1990 supported postmortem organ transplantation.	0.4249240829803595
The report dealt with the medical problems and harmonized them with the Christian value of solidarity.	0.4788431197407621
The ethical alternatives to organ transplantation, however, are not mentioned.	0.5964548567100036
Within this limitation, the report seems to adequately express the aim to strengthen individual competence and plead for fair perception of the neighbour's life-interest.	0.5002841666360166
Starting point for this analysis are the mobility needs and requirements of elderly, as well as problems concerning access and use of public transport.	0.49188453569331864
Elderly people as car drivers suffer from several performance deficits which are currently compensated by mobility restrictions and changed driving behaviour.	0.3720542393851236
Driver assistance systems, just available or soon on the market, are demonstrated and analysed with respect to their impact on elderly drivers.	0.5449150225109212
An expert evaluation comes to the conclusion that the most important systems for elderly are: emergency systems, enhanced vision systems and parking aids.	0.5815617570666701
Emergency systems can call rescue teams automatically or at driver's request, and direct them to the emergency location.	0.5363876863929017
Self imposed restrictions of elderly concerning night driving can partly be compensated by means of curve lightning and automatic dipping.	0.3156037443854934
Parking aids, using cameras or infrared technique are especially helpful for persons with movability problems.	0.4476480893400392
The group of helpful, but not highly important driver assistance systems covers several means for longitudinal and lateral control of the car, comprising autonomous cruise control, antilock systems and electronic stability programmes.	0.6062703963529955
The value and impact of these systems are analysed in the light of risk homeostasis theory.	0.5532309937786261
Reduced work load and ease of mobility will at last result from user centered navigation systems, helping the elder driver also to move to new areas without orientational problems.	0.3474572721861245
The article demonstrates the particular importance of specific layouts of the man-machine-interface for elderly, to guarantee high acceptance and minimal distraction from traffic.	0.5031974464291857
Causal treatment regimens of proven effectiveness in controlled studies are only available for cases of male infertility resulting from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.	0.48208342330146275
Drug treatment of retrograde ejaculation is also effective but has so far not been tested in double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized studies.	0.5183900886913503
The results of immunosuppressive therapy in cases of immunological male infertility are still controversial .	0.5972987764932935
In addition, antiphlogistic and antibiotic treatment of chronic male genital tract infections has not been shown to improve male fertility.	0.6456253893123871
Inconsistent results have been obtained with empirical therapy - e.g., with kallikein, tamoxifen, clomiphene, pentoxifylline, mast cell blockers, testolacton, vitamin E, captopril, alpha receptor blockers, glutathione, indometacin, interferon alpha, growth hormone, zinc salts, ketoprofen, mesterone or testosterone undecanoate - or the studies performed are not sufficient to allow a final judgement.	0.5949089991891275
Recent studies have indicated a possible impairment of sperm function by pure FSH, while GnrH and FSH have no influence on spermatogenesis in normogonadotropic men.	0.5062651042574933
In 40 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), in 5 patients with non-AD dementia and in 36 cognitively normal controls the concentration of protein tau was determined in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).	0.5952037091213275
Of the AD patients, 19 were very mildly demented (MMSE score from 25 to 28).	0.4676749557825828
Even in these patients, CSF tau was significantly more elevated than in controls.	0.4759891350392568
In the non-AD patients protein tau was less increased.	0.39358035097611516
Among the AD patients there was no association between CSF tau and severity of cognitive impairment or deficit in cerebral blood flow, determined by SPECT.	0.5319831318382556
Our findings suggest that CSF tau may be elevated even at the predementia stage of AD and be useful as a biological marker for the early recognition of the disease.	0.540116757272768
The aim of our review is to summarize relevant data on the perioperative use of anti-ischaemic drugs in patients at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease.	0.6995980427635006
The accessible medical literature according to current electronic information sources was explored.	0.2910073206338104
One in every eight general anaesthetics is administered to a patient at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease.	0.42651504363366977
Of these patients, it is estimated that 20% - 40% have perioperative myocardial ischaemia (PMI), the majority being nonsymptomatic.	0.8417522221259007
This figure correlates with the occurrence of postoperative cardiac complications and myocardial infarction.	0.43544190703776364
The anaesthetist therefore has an important role to play in reducing the rate of perioperative cardiac sequelae.	0.5600222205713016
This can be achieved with good control of haemodynamic stability and the timely and appropriate use of antiischaemic drugs.	0.5614762173269748
Nitrocompounds (nitrates, molsidomine) serve as the gold standard in current angina pectoris treatment.	0.4445548497147622
Acting as coronary and systemic vasodilators, they effect an immediate reduction in preload and have been shown to be the drugs of first choice for intraoperative myocardial ischaemia.	0.6853801300958675
Beta-blockers reduce the rate of PMI to a greater extent than nitrates.	0.48764247884961065
They are also effective in myocardial ischaemia not accompanied by an increased heart rate.	0.6579214285853328
Single pre-operative administration of beta-blockers has also been shown to be beneficial in reducing theincidence of perioperative tachycardia, hypertension, and PMI.	0.6156666315553511
Consequently, such one-time medication can be considered for previously untreated high-risk patients presenting for surgery.	0.811390005292802
The continuation of oral calcium channel blockers to the morning of surgery also reduces the rate of PMI and myocardial infarction in coronary-bypass patients, and combination with beta-blockers enhances this effect.	0.5876211314291053
Intra-operative diltiazem infusions are similarly advantageous in this patient group.	0.41361812516207724
In addition to nitrates, calcium antagonists are the drug of choice for coronary vasospasm.	0.6394327789956394
Drugs inhibiting platelet aggregation have a particular role in patients with coronary heart disease, however, they also cause increased perioperative bleeding.	0.5348215049011942
Consequently, it is recommended that these medications be discontinued 5 - 10 days prior to major surgery, with the exception of high-risk patients.	0.8081522988295996
Pilot studies using alpha2-agonists have shown reduced anaesthetic requirements and a reduction in PMI.	0.41016668198816514
The perioperative relevance of these drugs is currently being investigated.	0.6511849110285372
Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and possibly alpha2-agonists lead to reduced rates of PMI and other cardiac complications in risk patients.	0.6146072535916027
Current anti-anginal medications, with the exception of anti-platelet agents, should be maintained to the day of surgery and continued as soon as possible thereafter.	0.653834951592239
All of these drugs except anti-platelet agents may also be used intra-operatively, however, possible interactions with anaesthetic agents should be carefully considered.	0.6547204986686295
Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) were thought to be psychosomatic disorders.	0.4981179481974475
However, this argument has recently been questioned by many researchers.	0.5905681241454821
At the same time, biomedical factors have been described that were claimed to play a role in the aetiology and modulation of the course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).	0.6605736789484224
In the present paper, the state of research regarding both biomedical and psychosomatic factors of the aetiology and course of IBD is reviewed and critically evaluated from a methodological perspective.	0.7400584635900006
Results covering the following topics are presented: epidemiology; sociodemographic variables; genetic factors; dietary factors and cigarette smoking; drugs; permeability of bowel epithelia; immunological factors; microbiological factors; psychiatric disorders, affective symptoms, personality factors; life events and psychosocial stress; quality of life; and coping with the illness.	0.506777450941353
Among biomedical factors, a genetically based pathological immune reaction is highly probable.	0.51552441987021
However, the findings of immunological disturbances are of a more descriptive nature and seem to explain not the aetiological process of the development of the disease, but rather a kind of disposition.	0.8058585852214608
The question of which agents trigger the pathological immune cascade is still under investigation.	0.5311077330919489
Interesting findings can possibly be expected of the psycho-neuro-immunological research in this area.	0.39931213469724125
Results of research on psychological pathology (psychiatric disorders, personality factors) are inconclusive.	0.5465855362316947
In particular, some modern, well-controlled studies have not been able to confirm the findings of the older literature.	0.7410880960843723
Part of the high rate of psychiatric morbidity might be due to effects of selective sampling of more disturbed subjects.	0.5706297258305605
Research pertaining to the influence of distressing life events has also yielded inconsistent results.	0.36074156414290665
Prospective studies about the association of psychosocial stress and somatic symptomatology mostly demonstrated cross-sectional correlations which did not allow for causal interpretations.	0.4721583358375079
However, coping research has shown interesting results that point to the mediating influence of coping strategies on the course of the disease.	0.47449621280186394

A pregnancy with a partial or complete hydatidiform mole and a coexistent living fetus is a rare condition.	0.6283104513329395
Most cases are consistent with a twin pregnancy, with distinct borders between placenta and mole on sonography.	0.5482408706066378
We report a case with a single placenta with cystic structures resembling histologically a complete hydatidiform mole.	0.7014137966796324
The pregnancy resulted in a diploid female fetus in the 34th week of gestation with marked hypotrophy.	0.4056032757794017
The non-molar part of the placenta showed a complex alteration of villous maturity resulting in intrauterine growth retardation but a living fetus.	0.4287322882690215

The clinical and pathogenetic aspects of this rare entity are discussed.	0.8338160699025363
So far, necrosis of the lunate bone has been interpreted in the literature as a phenomenon with a traumatic, primarily vascular-arterial or mechanical causation.	0.5796055871903489
These models seem problematic, since neither the patients' histories nor the macroscopic-radiographical or histological appearances can be reconciled with them.	0.5158561400579749
In contrast, the model of a primarily venous aetiopathogenesis accepted for idiopathic necrosis of the femoral head is now examined.	0.5877519719745881
Evaluation of 125 cases of lunate bone necrosis treated in the Department of Orthopaedics at the University Hospital in Heidelberg between 1958 and 1993 made it possible to reconstruct the spontaneous course of the condition.	0.6378665224914245
X-Ray material, core spin tomographic images and material from a prospective study carried out in 49 patients with unexplained painful conditions of the wrist were available.	0.6469245407060491
A stage-by-stage progression emerged, which initially caused alterations only in the MR image, while the X-ray picture remained unremarkable.	0.7250348728187679
It was recognized from the spontaneous course that subsequent changes in the shape of the diseased lunate bones were always the result of the necrotic transformation process and never the cause of it.	0.6016552717745826
This meant that fractures were excluded as a possible cause of necrosis of the lunate bone.	0.5387917489655991
The spontaneous course was used as the basis of a stage-related classification for lunate bone necrosis.	0.7044094590837396
In a pressure measurement test, the behaviour of the intraosseous pressure in 16 necrotic lunate bones, 16 healthy lunate bones and 16 healthy capitate bones was tested under various functional conditions.	0.6061330664976663
The pressure fluctuations in the capitate bones were very slight, while in the healthy lunate bones pressure increased significantly during extension of the wrist.	0.5928757971154849
The position-dependent pressure increases in the lunate bones indicated that the venous drainage was constantly in jeopardy.	0.6120691155256702
The pressure increases in necrotic lunate bones were significantly in excess of those in healthy ones; in some cases they were far in excess of the systolic blood pressure.	0.6051655401147822
It was also concluded that necrotic lunate bones were mechanically deformed on movement.	0.4345557852891052
The anatomical causes of the pronounced pressure increases were examined experimentally.	0.44711138219123897
After staining of both the arteries and the veins, epoxy sheet plastination was used to fix six fresh cadaver arms in the neutral position and six in extension.	0.48438831836392643
Visualization of the vessels showed that capsular-ligamentous structures that were stretched on the palmar side and slackly turned back on themselves on the dorsal side still allowed the blood supply from the arteries, but substantially hindered venous drainage.	0.5242864739233964
The anatomical preparations made it possible to see that venous drainage from the lunate bone was being prevented; this explained the pronounced pressure increases.	0.48789752498468286
The unphysiological position of the base of the radius inclined in the palmar direction relative to the hand axis when it was extended dorsally was the crucial factor in the development of necrosis.	0.5100369013801909
Evaluation of the histories of the patients with necrosis of the lunate bone made it clear that trauma was not significantly involved in the causation, while manual work had an important role.	0.793814775195139
Most manual activites are performed with the wrist in extension.	0.46953617235143563
Any extension favours triggering of bone necrosis through congestion in the venous trunk.	0.3676853995724074
Thus, our investigations have shown that the beginning of this illness starts with congestion such as occurs with every extension of the wrist, which is initially physiological, before further factors favouring the process cause it to take a pathologic course.	0.7000144896379334

The surgical management of vesicovaginal fistulae (VVF) is a matter of controversy.	0.5556751560015019
This study deals with our experience with transvaginally treated patients suffering from VVF.	0.4734582457075473
Between 1966 and 1996, 64 patients with VVF were treated surgically.	0.4998912759899789
The VVF occurred in the course of hysterectomy in 54 patients, was due to radiotherapy in 7, was a result of obstetric complications in 2 patients, and occurred after colporrhaphy in 1 patient.	0.7189632405092576
In 60 of these 64 patients closure of the fistula was carried out transvaginally.	0.556471415681015
Fourteen of these 60 patients (23 %) had undergone prior surgical attempts to close the VVF (1 to 3 procedures).	0.706248909749575
Transvaginal surgery was successful at first attempt in 55 of these 60 patients (92 %).	0.46067224192623635
The other 5 patients were successfully treated by a second procedure (again transvaginal: n = 3; transabdominal: n = 2).	0.5321272456317055
In conclusion, the transvaginal approach to close VVF is of advantage, avoiding an abdominal incision and reducing postoperative morbidity.	0.4638292391390811
In the vast majority of the cases isolated VVF can be treated successfully by transvaginal repair.	0.7165105264754552

In 300 patients with 339 coronary lesions the percent diameter stenosis (%-DS) was assessed both by visual estimation and by digital quantitative coronary angiography (DQCA) by use of an on-line computer workstation.	0.7551161626633417
The decision for coronary angioplasty in the same setting ("prima vista"-PTCA) was based on history, evidence of ischemia and visual estimation of %-DS.	0.8901387134543752
DQCA measurements of the 339 stenoses revealed a normal distribution of lesion severity with a mean of 58.4  +/-  11.3%.	0.7941386089179208
In contrast to DQCA visual estimation led to a bimodal distribution with a nadir at ~55% between two peaks at ~45% and ~75% and a mean of 70.5  +/-  19.6%.	0.8615873667325753
Visual estimation underestimated lesions in the range of 30-55% and overestimated the %-DS between 55-99%.	0.7536835575923281
Visual estimation revealed a %-DS >= 60% in 251 stenoses (74.0%) of the 339 lesions, an estimate that led to subsequent "prima vista"-PTCA.	0.7647836111326901
Conversely, DQCA revealed only 184 stenoses (54.3%) with a %-DS >= 60%; thus, 86 stenoses (25.3%) did not meet the morphologic indication criteria for PTCA.	0.6709590353836513
The bimodal distribution of stenosis severity according to visual analysis with an overestimation of borderline stenosis severity reflects a tendency for "self-referral" of patients for PTCA.	0.6104512211073436
DQCA serves as an objective tool in the decision-making process for PTCA and may reduce "cosmetic" interventions or justify to defer PTCA.	0.5544117404416913
Especially in the selection process for "prima vista"-PTCA DQCA-quantification of stenosis severity is recommended.	0.5876401271809945

Three typical pathological reactions of blood pressure and heart rate can be differentiated.	0.5417481829748495
The hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension is characterised by an immediate drop in blood pressure (systolic drop >20 mmHg below base line within 3 min) with or without compensatory tachycardia.	0.6086679756634887
It is caused by peripheral or central sympathetic dysfunction.	0.3212692620320802
Tachycardia (>30 beats per minute above base line within 10 min) without significant blood pressure drop but with a fall of cerebral blood flow indicates a postural tachycardia syndrome.	0.6905713165276451
In general, there is no further somatic dysfunction.	0.5651460040099952
Increased venous pooling is thought to be the assumed pathomechanism.	0.5928909911250708
A reflex mechanism evokes the neurocardiogenic syncope after a certain time of standing: sympathetic inhibition yields a strong blood pressure drop and vagal activation bradycardia.	0.34913681522238615
Proved therapies include use of the mineralocorticoide fludrocortison (hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension), of the a-agonist midodrin (postural tachycardia syndrome) and of b-blockers (neurocardiogenic syncope).	0.6341855580223301

Several different theories exist about the orign of kinetosis and the space adaption syndrome, with individual sensitivities differing significantly.	0.44532902512078004
One explanation involves the hypothesis of a different otolith mass between the right and left statolith organ and especially a difference in the utricles.	0.5350444868239255
A difference in mass results in a different sensitivity to acceleration.	0.572833095226153
For this reason we measured interindividual variances in saccular and utricular otolith mass.	0.3518313601470941
Since the anatomy of the vestibular organ in vertebrates is based as similar principles, we selected fish (salmon and trout) as our study model to facilitation preparations.	0.5238929728003646
The maximum difference in mass in the saccule was 17% and was generally smaller in the utricle, although in individual cases was much higher.	0.7128057741352288
We assume that a misbalanced sensitivity of the statolith organs occurs but is totally compensated for by the vestibular system as long as physiological motion patterns take place.	0.5035690257580525
Decompensation leads to kinetosis under non-physiological motion patterns.	0.23701637319170274
When the vestibular system is better balanced and has an equally distributed otolith mass to both sides, the possibility for developing kinetosis or space adaption syndrome is much less likely.	0.5189046412643771

Hence, we have studied two human osteosarcoma cell lines (Saos-2 and MG-63) with different degrees of differentiation and different constitutive IL-6 production (3.4 +/- 0.3 (mean  +/- SE) and 3309 +/- 578 pg/106 cells).	0.8196389186312298
We measured glucocorticoid receptor (GR) number and affinity as a function of the exposure of cells to different amounts of IL-6.	0.5219230764331959
Incubation for 20 h with IL-6 at increasing concentrations up to 2000 pg/ml yielded a significant increase of GR binding sites in both cell lines.	0.5000112227598605
IL-6 was also able to reverse the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone (1 µmol/l) on GR in both cell lines.	0.6145954408822838
In MG-63 cells, expressing higher concentrations of GR, IL-6 deprivation via a specific anti-IL-6 antibody (100 ng/ml) significantly decreased GR.	0.581290978217211
In Saos-2 cells, expressing lower concentrations of GR, a 40 h treatment with human IL-1 (10 ng/ml) significantly increased both IL-6 production and GR.	0.6617538155886459
This latter effect was completely abolished by co-treating the cells with the anti-IL-6 antibody.	0.4602110824691836

However, in advanced malignant disease, this therapy is often associated with increased morbidity and lethality.	0.7639322024723831
Adjuvant therapies cannot be initiated when needed.	0.26177669860559366
Therefore, long-term survival remains unaffected.	0.6923041557991553
Advances in biomedical science provide preliminary explanations for these therapeutic problems.	0.3322372145708911
Modern therapeutic concepts like neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced tumors are based on these findings.	0.5368036965572021
The probability of complete R0 resections, necessary to improve long-term survival, can be enhanced by these therapies.	0.6613765621071879
The ongoing prospective neoadjuvant studies for gastrointestinal tumors are already very encouraging.	0.32492083173665703
The simulation of unilateral deafness is very rare.	0.41199846971833026
Objective findings are of special interest if it happens.	0.5505555433233184
A patient with alleged deafness on the left-hand side due to commotio cerebri was treated in our hospital.	0.5597760847909842
Pure tone audiometry showed deafness on the left-hand side and normal hearing on the right-hand side.	0.5227742377996683
However, stapedius reflexes were found ipsilaterally left as well as contralaterally right, at 0.5 to 2 kHz with a stimulation of approxamately 90 dB SPL.	0.5812388225876608
Transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were measured.	0.5366229173928307
The TEOAE had the same reproducibility but a very low response on both sides, such that inner ear function could not be evaluated.	0.6498103117321115
In comparison, the DP gram showed clear DP amplitudes over the whole frequency range on both sides.	0.5461393755637007
Nonphysiological DPs could be excluded by assessing the DP growth rate at three different frequencies.	0.49859627695253617
By means of brainstem electric response audiometry (BERA), with which the IV/V complex was detectable up to stimulation with 20 dB SPL clicks, and the Stenger test, a neural or central hearing loss could be excluded.	0.5888305498288068
Normal hearing on the left-hand side was thus confirmed.	0.4172280747381191
In cases of simulated deafness it is possible to prove a normal inner ear function by DPOAE.	0.5872273544269903
DPOAE therefore complements the list of potential audiological simulation tests.	0.2576378428416608
Controlled studies of adrenal steroids in premenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have revealed subtle and inconsistent decreases in glucocorticosteroid (GCS) function, but prominent deficiencies of adrenal androgens (AA).	0.5270440468720595
Such findings have suggested that hypoandrogenicity may predispose to RA in younger women.	0.4139641429034308
However, recent prospective studies of serum cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels before (x = 12 yrs) the onset of the disease (pre-RA) offer an alternative perspective.	0.7017239990669629
Significant dissociation of serum cortisol and DHEAS levels was found only in the subgroup of premenopausal women who developed RA before age 50.	0.4212512170013807
This subgroup alone had significant deficiency in serum DHEAS levels.	0.27071043884902335
A growing number of casualties and the increasing restrictions of funding will lead as a consequence to changes within the field of trauma surgery.	0.5604952565438981
Despite these developments trauma surgery must maintain its major responsibility towards the victims of accidents.	0.3291879425934207
Therefore the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU) has to face the future economic and social challenges to influence the coming changes.	0.6399803565127004
This role compromises the engagement in a continuous struggle for the high and global standard of injury care in Germany, for quality assessment, education and training, research and adequate public relations.	0.6389403248168873
This paper outlines the aspects and visions of future trauma surgery and the means which may continue to guaranty international acknowledged standard of trauma care in Germany.	0.461699174411836
Radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice in atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.	0.6645051157480545
Electrophysiologic investigations in 623 patients revealed eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation: Ablation of fast (I) or slow(II), modification of fast (III) or slow AV nodal pathways (IV), modification of both pathways (V), ablation of fast and modification of slow (VI), ablation of slow and modification of fast pathways (VII) and ablation of both pathways (VIII).	0.5760179088408958
The criteria of diagnosis of these eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation are described.	0.54240939124844
Follow-up showed fewer relapses in patients with ablation (0-2%) in comparison to patients with modification of a single AV nodal pathway (8-12%).	0.7969447626345261
Alteration of both pathways includes an increasing risk of total AV nodal block, which occured in 7 patients (1.1%).	0.7323080507575889
Detailed analysis of the mechanism of catheter ablation is recommended in all patients after radiofrequency current delivery for AV nodal reentrant tachycardia to estimate the risk of relapsing during follow-up or development of total AV block in the particular patient in case of a further ablation procedure.	0.7335260467802468
An increasing life expectancy leads to a higher number of persons aged 70-84 years and persons aged 85 years and older.	0.5089591983278134
Information concerning changes in the spectrum of psychiatric morbidity is rare.	0.6213242666248329
The Berlin Aging Study was based on a representative age- and gender-stratified sample (n = 516) of Berlin citizens aged 70-100 years and older.	0.629634259738906
In this interdisciplinary study, an intensive investigation was carried out by psychologists, sociologists, internists and psychiatrists.	0.576301838997182
This report focuses on subjectively reported complaints (Beschwerdeliste, BL), observed psychopathological symptomatology (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, BPRS) and psychiatric diagnoses following the criteria of DSM-III-R (based on the Geriatric Mental State Examination, GMS-A).	0.48989794420947474
On the self-rating scale (BL) 10 % of all persons reported severe subjective complaints, 32 % moderate complaints.	0.6453994095554072
On the BPRS, 17 % showed severe psychopathological symptomatology, 75 % at least mild symptoms.	0.8608444207033982
Following the criteria of DSM-III-R, 23.5 % of all persons had a psychiatric disease, 4.2 % a disease of severe intensity.	0.8580495029270246
When the DSM-III-R diagnoses "Not Otherwise Specified" (NOS) were included 40.4 % of all subjects were diagnosed by the clinical judgement of the psychiatrists to have a psychiatric disease.	0.7428813041919795
The most frequent psychiatric diseases were insomnia (18.8 %), depression NOS (17.8 %) and dementia (13.8 %).	0.7351224575236789
Dementia showed the well-known age-related increase, whereas no other incidences of psychiatric morbidity were age-related.	0.6836073639914951
Persons aged 70-84 years did not differ in the investigated psychiatric variables from persons aged 85 years and older, the only exception being the prevalence of dementia.	0.5980018210063455
A first overview concerning developmentary risk factors and protective factors for later psychic and psychosomatic disease is presented.	0.4391604980315232
Problems within the context of the collection of data and evaluation are discussed.	0.5607405183063299
We analyzed how psoriasis patients sought professional help and correlated it to their illness attitudes and feelings of stigmatization.	0.33011412223898234
Semi-structured interviews of 400 patients were reanalyzed to identify homogeneous groups concerning initial reactions at first manifestations of the disease.	0.4404855086832207
Four groups ("isolated", "stigmatized", "socially supported" and "non-stigmatized" patients) were found and cross-tabulated with five resulting groups of a second cluster-analysis concerning the "style" of the seeking behaviour of professional and paraprofessional help and medical measures against the psoriasis ("multi-users", "arranged mini-users", "waiting-room patients", "optimists" and "self- therapists").	0.7321402653761871
We were able to describe typical courses of illness behaviour depending on the initial reaction.	0.45543100943826037
The results are discussed with regard to the desirable identification of problematic patients within professional care units.	0.5272423993063575
The sonographic diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described.	0.6419682757535339
Malignant lymphomas are sonographically relatively uniform: initial enlargement of the lymph nodes and organs involved and disturbance of normal echo texture by mainly hypoechoic lesions can be found.	0.521262071568274
Generally, four sonographic patterns of infiltration are described: diffuse, small nodular, large nodular and bulky type.	0.5733644366851987
Secondary, tumor-related or inflammatory complications (e. g. dislocation or compression of vessels, thoracic inlet syndrome, venous thrombosis, ileus, urinary retention, abscess and effusion) can be sonographically evaluated.	0.672810406934126
Response to therapy correlates with normalization of size and echo texture and recovery from tumor-related complications.	0.561527944299276
Differential diagnosis with ultrasound is based on the topographic distribution and echo pattern of infiltration and, with certain restrictions, on the echogenicity of lesions and perfusion feasible with Doppler sonography.	0.6252209414704909
The primary diagnosis has to be established histologically.	0.6836858458343608
The treatment of acute posterior instabilities can involve a reconstructive procedure as well as an antidislocation augmentation.	0.5838077641088913
Tibial bony avulsion ruptures must be reconstructed.	0.19943606478490308
For the treatment of chronic posterior instabilities we used the patella tendon graft, which can be implanted by an anterior or posterior approach.	0.754418397845538
In cases of posterolateral instabilities, additional procedures are necessary.	0.4712237852334145
Ultrasound of the Achilles tendon is a suitable means of differentiating various diseases of the tendon and the surrounding tissue.	0.5550851609978319
Different forms of degenerative disease (tendinitis, peritendinitis or bursitis, fibroosteitis, and Haglund's disease) can be discriminated from rheumatic and metabolic diseases.	0.4732952622402278
Congenital and developmental abnormalities can also be detected.	0.3955953087641272
Tendon degeneration mainly occurs in the ventral part of the medial third of the tendon ("critical zone").	0.7879870447279764
Immature tissue in this area leads to temorary instability of the tendon with a high risk of rupture ("vulnerable phase").	0.756976702980401
With sonography, lesions of the Achilles tendon are visible early in the course of the disease.	0.4980197697027684
The German social security legislation has recognized only recently the concern of quality assessment in the field of social and medical services.	0.4943695181849588
The legal frame for quality assessment in the field of medical treatment was enacted in the sickness insurance provision (Social Code - Book V) only in 1989.	0.589830498649389
Quality assessment is considered to be a part of the production of medical services and, therefore, is regulated in the context of providing medical services.	0.679123950572293
The legal provisions do not establish standards for quality and quality assessment.	0.4285550320781156
Due to the variety of medical services, quality assessment is not regulated in an exhaustive or systematic manner.	0.6405164194729839
According to the law, providers of medical services (doctors, hospitals) are bound to participate in quality assessment.	0.6733287000030058
As internal quality assessment prevails in the definition of the various measures of quality assessment and the control of quality in all fields of medical treatment, external quality assessment is also prescribed for hospitals.	0.8065405466546767
Because the establishment of quality assessment is considered to be a part of the service production organization, consumers (patients) or their representatives are not involved in the definition, establishment, and control of quality assessment.	0.7840917946758844
The participation of patients should be provided by law.	0.5369008026277249
Introduction: Because of an increasing number of endoscopic hernia procedures, it is important to look into the possibility of standardizing these techniques helping surgeons to acquire the operative skills necessary.	0.6195762954084141
Material and Methods: To discuss these aspects, the documented data on TAPP operations that have been carried out in this department since 1993 were analyzed.	0.623998996936747
The results of teaching procedures were compared with those of experts after they had gotten past the learning and development curve.	0.6290120387291612
Results: A total of 778 teaching procedures were performed by 10 surgeons with an individual experience of 30.5 operations (median).	0.6443763108041111
Before starting the first procedure, 89 were done by assistants operating the camera.	0.4919087233757203
The morbidity of teaching operations was 1.9 % compared to 1.4 % for those performed by experts.	0.7840774248056496
After a median follow-up of 23 months there were two recurrences (0.23 %) in the expert group and none in the teaching group (follow-up 16 months).	0.6883801789886175
Conclusion: Because of the potentials of standardization of the TAPP technique, the results of teaching were equal to expert operations.	0.719086067077281
Therefore, TAPP is suitable for application in a routine setting.	0.5407320083265534
In spite of the high and lasting efficiency of transurethral prostatectomy, intraoperative blood loss results in increased morbidity in this procedure.	0.6616086023860475
This led to the development of many alternative treatment modalities in the last years.	0.6782105307564914
To minimize the risk of bleeding, we improved the high-frequency technology in several steps.	0.8057170385256323
To achieve this, the output signals of commercially available high-frequency generators were modulated to the effect that each cut results in an efficient coagulation zone in the tissue at excellent cutting quality.	0.6510632383036519
Laboratory and in vitro studies using porcine kidneys as well as clinical trials showed good cutting characteristics accompanied by a significant reduction of bleeding.	0.6374596231859031
As a result, blood transfusions were less necessary, the transurethral catheter could be removed earlier in the postoperative period, and hospitalization time was significantly reduced.	0.7504170551893682
In conclusion, the improved high-frequency technology in form of the "coagulating intermittent cutting" results in a blood-sparing tissue resection with a consecutive reduction of morbidity.	0.6608957533840027
An accurate assessment of the duration of the ability to act following fatal poisoning can be of major importance in reconstructing circumstances leading to death, especially in determining whether the poisoning was accidental, self-inflicted, or the result of a criminal act.	0.7240483993594856
Clinical publications have scarcely dealt with this problem.	0.236576845112053
We therefore examined 20 legal autopsies performed at the Institutes of Forensic Medicine of the Universities of Würzburg and Leipzig as well as the respective records of the police and prosecuting attorney's offices in an effort to clarify this question.	0.4531274689942692
As a rule the victims retained the ability to act for 10-15 min.	0.5634144350895255
However, the material we examined and the literature also contain cases in which the ability to act lasted considerably longer.	0.7815614514435075
The present study is intended to provide expert witnesses with guidelines for clarification of cases of fatal intoxication.	0.6580394776810197
Androgenablation is the therapy of choice for the treatment of advanced and metastatic prostate cancer.	0.5557406138985238
However, in more than half of the patients the disease will ultimately progress within 2 years.	0.7709777334338369
Intermittent androgenablation through medical castration maintains the apoptotic potential.	0.20344526585049866
By periodically changing phases on and off treatment the quality of life of the patients is improved.	0.7457242511978006
Apart from reduced toxicity treatment costs are lowered and tumor progression is possibly delayed.	0.3452704639284237
In how far survival is influenced is presently not clear and remains to be evaluated in further clinical trials.	0.49451682791888213
During pressure support ventilation (PSV), the timing of the breathing cycle is mainly controlled by the patient.	0.5783600402025196
Therefore, the delivered flow pattern during PSV might be better synchronised with the patient's demands than during volume-assisted ventilation.	0.6072567469811635
In several modern ventilators, inspiration is terminated when the inspiratory flow decreases to 25% of the initial peak value.	0.5389178395357552
However, this timing algorithm might cause premature inspiration termination if the initial peak flow is high.	0.5625965970742848
This could result not only in an increased risk of dyssynchronization between the patient and the ventilator, but also in reduced ventilatory support.	0.8588319465604456
On the other hand, a decreased peak flow might inappropriately increase the patient's inspiratory effort.	0.5559745776369802
The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of the variation of the initial peak-flow rate during PSV on respiratory pattern and mechanical work of breathing.	0.6859393469822342
To date, positron emission tomography (PET) is the most powerful tool for the non-invasive study of biochemical processes.	0.6720868761518893
Besides its usefulness for basic research PET has been proven to be superior to conventional diagnostic methods in several clinical indications.	0.5224206007418535
However, the introduction of PET into clinical practice has been hindered considerably by its costs.	0.5822085063395748
Several American studies lend support to the hypothesis that PET may be more cost-effective than the conventional diagnostic work-up - at least for some of its clinical indications.	0.750041970974519
In Germany, however, this hypothesis has still not been verified.	0.5897944477806437
The rapid growth, development and organ differentiation during early human development depend on an adequate and balanced substrate availability.	0.46753753107313684
It is well known that early nutrition has short term effects (e.g.	0.4005515553834242
on growth), and that marked metabolic imbalances in infancy (e.g.	0.48057484930883215
hypoglycaemia, phenylketonuria) have long term effects on child development.	0.5752367313363383
More recent studies indicate that also variations of metabolic conditions within the normal range, which occur during sensitive periods of early human development, may have marked long term effects on later prognosis and disease risks in adulthood.	0.629682598439915
This metabolic programming was demonstrated in epidemiologic studies indicating close relationships between indicators of early growth and the disease incidence and the mortality of coronary heart disease in late adulthood.	0.5357728563724994
Long term effects of infant feeding on immunological functions are indicated by the effects of infant feeds on later prevalence of allergic disease and by the difference in morbidity for diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease and malignant lymphoma between previously breast fed and formula fed infants.	0.5868552768112258
An improved understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that modulate these observed long term effects is required to enable effective preventive interventions.	0.5799370816328595
Already the available information indicates a great potential for actively improving long term child health and development by an improved substrate supply during pregnancy and infancy.	0.4275061371598023
Persons who cross international boundaries are at increased risk of contracting infectious diseases.	0.39198452265463996
An analysis of the reported communicable diseases in Germany shows: A large number of cases of typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, shigella infections, trichinellosis and brucellosis notified during the last years in Germany originated from foreign countries.	0.5934509472672398
Intervention measures are necessary, above all, with regard to gastrointestinal infections and vaccine-preventable diseases.	0.4671390083714508
Bilateral testicular tumors account for approximately 3,5 % of all testicular malignancies and to our knowlegde about 800 cases are reported in the literature.	0.6254440420216971
An even more seldom event is the appearance of a testicular germ cell tumor with a contralateral benign non-germ cell tumor.	0.505927618706703
We report the 6th case of such a coincidence.	0.7166543939304801
The dignity of a contralateral tumor should be assured by frozen section and in case of benign histology organ preserving therapy is indicated.	0.36948864685130883
Even in cases of bilateral testis cancer tumor enucleation may be considered, if the strict conditions for resection and follow-up are respected.	0.5807357303734153
Most sudden cardiac deaths are arrhythmic.	0.2589976055481446
Besides the known effects of beta-blockers, among true antiarrhythmic drugs only amiodarone seemed to reduce total cardiac mortality in patients at risk.	0.5334283125198839
Reevaluation of amiodarone with or without a beta-blocker in primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death after review of recent publications.	0.44626861905742926
Only augmentation of case numbers by meta-analyses of controlled trials could demonstrate that amiodarone not only reduces sudden cardiac death but also diminishes total cardiac mortality.	0.43495943199327824
However, the number of avoided sudden deaths is small in comparison to the number of treated cases.	0.573285106464742
This and specific side effects of amiodarone contradict a general primary prophylaxis with this drug.	0.5417379415100269
An additional benefit by combining amiodarone with beta-blockers seems to exist but has to be proven by further studies.	0.5416190831477574
At present, primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death with amiodarone with or without a beta-blocker is an individual decision in all cases with special risk considerations.	0.5720966753817117
As a result of a critical review of the literature and a survey at German epilepsy centers of usual pre- and postoperative drug treatment, the following strategy is recommended:	0.8497978936197833
An ecological theory of remembering is formulated which is based on the patterns of meaningfulness in the social and spatial environment.	0.4899433219842125
The specific ecological relationship to the environment is affinitive, and also opens access to the ressources of the past.	0.5915291651526939
In the present study, conditions for this access (in particular with older people) were investigated.	0.8497211036957153
It is assumed that older people, especially, when they lose someone with whom they had a fixed relationship seek counselling and that abrupt changes in the spatial environment, such as moving to a home, are rejected by older people.	0.6347063881290572
These hypotheses were checked on the basis of material (N=120) gathered in a counselling service for the aged and they were essentially confirmed.	0.407043270961433
To make matters clear, "typical" and thus every-day experiences of maintenance and loss of competence are cited from the material.	0.6629660575005384
Finally, practical conclusions are drawn with regard to work with the aged.	0.4092122438317275
Following Shouldice repair of a primary inguinal hernia 50 patients were given subcutaneous Redon drains, while another 50 patients underwent operations without drains in a prospective randomized trial.	0.6219132954439166
The amount of postoperative wound secretion in the drainage bottle was added to fluid retention established by sonographic volumetric analysis.	0.40125482594865275
The degree of personal impairment was estimated by a visual analogue score.	0.5513431209394692
Inflammation parameters were recorded as well as the rate of complications.	0.662161018183566
The drain group showed significantly increased fluid production in comparison to the group without drains on the 1st postoperative day (36.0 vs. 2.5 ml).	0.8518160887048162
Wound sepsis was found in two patients in the drain group.	0.7925204636422943
Seven patients with drains and eight patients without underwent percutaneous seroma puncture.	0.3857936653790643
The drain only slightly affected personal impairment (25.6 % vs 21.4 %, visual analogue score).	0.6854991651967496
Body temperature was elevated in the drain group on the 3rd day after operation (37.2 vs 36.7  °C).	0.7100076381299407
We believe there is no indication for the routine use of a Redon drain in the repair of a primary inguinal hernia.	0.731913096970841
Instead, percutaneous puncture of subcutaneous fluid retentions should be performed.	0.4693560023384706
We report on three arterial thromboses of the external iliac artery following total hip replacement.	0.6446581512666252
As a result of implanted cement/spongiosa or protrusion of the acetabular component, the iliac vessels were compressed.	0.5826388021926944
Furthermore, we report about one intraoperative arterial vessel lesion in a 65-year-old patient during a revision operation.	0.8241672629804433
We recommend that in case of acute ischemic syndromes of lower limbs following total hip replacement, an angiography should be performed in order to exclude an extravascular cause of thrombosis.	0.7176891883178543
For therapy in those cases extra-anatomic bypasses should be preferred to thrombectomies.	0.5294375806391822
One of the most important occupations of manual therapists is the treatment of hypomobilities of intervertebral joints.	0.5595789226588267
Such hypomobilities of the spine are treated with different kind of manipulations or mobilisations.	0.5909389113960397
The pathophysiological basis of hypomobilities is subject of discussion.	0.3947330165381292
Objective criteria for the diagnosis of disturbed spinal mobility are missing.	0.5044387887886246
They are not detectable in X-ray, computertomography or NMR.	0.5141187636267672
In this article, we report on a family in which five examined members showed clinical signs of Fechtner syndrome, a condition which consists of hearing loss (49%), macrothrombocytopenia (100%), leukocyte inclusion bodies (100%), eye anomalies (54.3%), and nephritis (38.7%).	0.6367486627508193
This article describes how tissue culture has developed from an observing method to a powerful analytical technique for oncology and for pathological cell changes such as metabolic disorders and degenerative diseas es.	0.46011534183720454
Standard terms are defined and basic methods are explained.	0.3044360746394355
Different models of in vitro culture - monolayer, three-dimensional tumor cultures, and organ cultures - are critically reviewed in respect of their significance for the interpret ation of in vivo tissue.	0.72042477855158
Two important recent extensions of tissue culture, serum-free cell culture and the introduction of genetic material into cells, are described.	0.5767612527867475
The objective of this prospective, randomised study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting (PONV) during the first 24 h postoperatively.	0.7950724879976855
For a quality assurance study on PONV, we compared two established general anaesthetic procedures in 239 patients undergoing four different types of surgery (subtotal thyroidectomy, laparotomy for gynaecological procedures, laparoscopy, and surgery for extra-abdominal procedures).	0.5764108227366205
The historical opinion that the intima layer of a ruptured artery of muscular type could stop bleeding by "rolling in" should be controlled experimentally.	0.4862908434027019
Five segments of human femoral/popliteal artery (3-4 cm long) were overstretched until complete rupture occured.	0.6906836037739726
Furthermore a longitudinally split and a partially oblique incised segment were ruptured.	0.2942811866747065
As morphological findings a sandclock deformity was observed in the region of rupture.	0.5626995928188764
This phenomenon was induced by adventitia layer, which closed the ends of ruptured media layer like a Chinese finger trap.	0.5390404205818288
In the longitudinally split segment a transverse rupture of the media layer could be observed, while the fibers of adventitia layer were pulled out when the traction was continued.	0.5538166825026073
Neither macroscopical nor microscopical signs could be found for "rolling in" of intima or media layer.	0.447063457785287
The reason for spontaneous hemostasis after arterial rupture is more likely the activation of platelets by collagenous fibers of adventitia layer than "rolling in" of intima or media layer.	0.4531929446041693
If there is no finger trap mechanism of adventitia layer like in shot- or stabwounds a massive blood loss must be expected.	0.5686494373388484
Time and again a lack of staff in the field of people's nursing is discussed (chronic lack of nursing staff); this means that there are not enough people to do the available work) (1).	0.5748902415061469
However, the time factor is also an important sociological dimension in old people's stationary care.	0.712161087426745
First of all, this article points out the time dimension throughout life.	0.5996147565905484
This is followed by people's varying perceptions of the present and the related upsets and misunderstandings.	0.6683543379810482
Hereby the contradictory abundance and limitation in time as felt by the elderly also becomes apparent.	0.3708321408519284
The old people's awareness of the dwindling remainder of their own lifespans conflicts with the seemingly endless time of each day that passes.	0.3834657947021957
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has evolved to a research tool to an intrinsic part of modern invasive cardiology.	0.5437881478452408
The main reason is the capability to obtain "in-vivo" micro anatomy by means of miniaturized echo-transducers with an outer diameter of 2.9-3.5 French.	0.6998083376740433
For the first time it is possible to base decisions not only on lumenograms but also on vessel wall assessment.	0.7153799087357673
The capabilities of IVUS can be divided in its diagnostic and intervention associated potentials.	0.5170849356996134
The diagnostic strength of IVUS is the ability to monitor compensatory coronary artery enlargement as a response to arteriosclerosis, to assess intermediate lesions, to reveal occult left main stem disease, and angiographically "silent" arteriosclerosis.	0.6361077210597267
In conjunction with the estimation of intracoronary flow reserve, patients with the diagnosis of coronary "syndrome X" can be better classified into those with or without early signs of arteriosclerosis.	0.6954178433307909
Additionally, IVUS is at present the only method allowing the classification of coronary artery lesions according to the AHA/ACC Stary classification.	0.6227347812012657
Introduction: The chronic exertional compartment syndrome of the musculus tibialis anterior is thought to be responsible for a major part of complaints of the lower leg among active sportsmen.	0.6389889847048857
There is an important role of tissue pressure measurement in diagnosing chronic anterior compartment syndrome during muscular activity.	0.7726402954048661
However, there is a controversial debate about the relevant parameters.	0.6652350020305656
The development of frontal sinuses following bilateral fronto-orbital advancement is a topic of controversial discussion in the literature.	0.4325518617455129
In a retrospective study on 33 patients (15 girls and 18 boys) the development of the frontal sinus was examined radiologically.	0.7620956632373813
Only patients with a minimum age of 6 years and with at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up were included.	0.7599687175740957
The radiological reference for the frontal sinus development consisted of pneumatisation at or above the level of the supraorbital rims, as projected in postero-anterior cephalograms.	0.5390313481003075
According to these criteria a frontal sinus development was seen in 72.7% of our patients.	0.7742882751690165
There was no statistically proven correlation between sinus development and the sex of the patient, age at surgery or the amount of advancement.	0.7336907370798319
With the exception of severe cases of Crouzon's disease we usually expect normal development of the frontal sinus following bilateral fronto-orbital correction.	0.5346802767127844
Failures after ankle arthrodesis are, according to the literature and our own experience, more frequently seen with external fixation than with internal fixation methods.	0.7665456630560723
Favourable results can be obtained with the standard four-screw technique, preservation of the ankle and the biomechanical axes seeing only one non-union in 44 own cases with this technique.	0.6900803470603014
A vital X-ray imaging technique in oral and craniomaxillofacial surgery is the panoramic X-ray.	0.5220903957236622
Due to its variety of special projections, including imaging of the transversal level and low exposure to radiation, it is suitable for answering many clinical questions and for diagnostics of various findings.	0.6397244822343817
It has become possible to minimize the necessary doses by further development of technology and devices, as well as of X-ray films and by new detection systems, such as sensors or screens.	0.6593875115134157
In some clinical cases, the diagnostic deficiencies of conventional imaging techniques make computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging indispensable.	0.6198927523507122
Although MR is particularly suitable for soft tissue imaging, it has also become helpful in finding cortical changes by shorter measuring times.	0.5563404889529099
In certain cases, e. g., changes to bone metabolism, differentiated methods of nuclear medicine make image-aided analysis of function possible.	0.488845687871166
Secondary haematogenous joint involvement is seen in less than 1 % of patients with Salmonella infections.	0.7383493156321899
These atypical infections are frequently encouraged by pre-existing local or systemic disease.	0.47007971235368795
We present a case of a patient with known alcohol abuse who developed a septic infection of her right hip requiring resection of the femoral head.	0.7013405777917653
Histologic analysis showed signs of pre-existing osteonecrosis probably induced by alcohol intake.	0.4349980205740445
Cartilage and bone were invaded and destructed by an aggressive granulation tissue.	0.42117364910128774
Initially, a biopsy evaluated without knowledge of the positive bacteriological result had been interpreted as indicative of a tumour.	0.5115837240427044
The onset, clinical course, diagnosis and therapy of joint involvement by Salmonella are discussed with regard to our case and the relevant literature.	0.6753409518289681
This case illustrates the necessity for clinicians to share all their information about the patient with the pathologist.	0.6047412400568521
There are two types of diabetes mellitus.	0.5642076968680675
Type I, insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM), which becomes manifest before the age of 40, is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin.	0.738127229050321
Type II, the non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM), develops in the elderly and is caused by a relative insulin deficiency.	0.6071662687196009
Patients with type-I diabetes are prone to the development of ketoacidosis, while type II causes hyperglycaemic, hyperosmolar, nonketotic coma.	0.5411776662063251
Apart from these acute metabolic alterations, the long-term complications of diabetes are of concern to the anaesthesiologist.	0.5992975371514815
Hypertension, coronary artery disease, renal insufficiency and autonomic neuropathy are common and can result in myocardial ischaemia, cardiovascular instability and gastroparesis, with an increased risk of aspiration.	0.8071795948299193
Limited movement of the atlanto-occipital joint can cause difficult intubation.	0.38297079125625394
To avoid perioperative metabolic catastrophy, blood glucose concentration should be kept between 6.7 and 10 mmol - l-1 (120 - 180 mg - dl-1).	0.7117980923798093
Hypoglycaemia can result in neurological damage, whereas hyperglycaemia causes impaired wound healing and susceptibility to infections and worsens ischaemic damage to the myocardium and brain.	0.6081233337757643
Perioperative diabetes management depends on the severity of the surgical procedure and the type of diabetes.	0.7218402933785266
All type-I diabetics, whatever operation being performed, need insulin.	0.4419578551953353
The intravenous route is recommended as it allows better adjustment.	0.5653802167239573
After determination of the fasting blood glucose level, insulin is given at a dosage of 0.5 - 1 U - h-1 (at gluc<11.1 mmol - l-1), 1.5 - 2 U - h-1 (at gluc 11.1 - 16.7 mmol - l-1) or 3  U - h-1 (at gluc>16.7 mmol - l-1).	0.7870540888073756
In addition, 5 - 10 g glucose - h-1 is given.	0.7679676670980418
In type-II diabetes the oral antidiabetic drug is withheld.	0.41977971814748144
During minor surgery the blood glucose concentration is monitored frequently, and if necessary insulin (with gluc>13.9 mmol - l-1) or glucose is given.	0.6865588374233945
In most cases of major surgery insulin therapy will be necessary.	0.5811868196181893
Administration should follow the guidelines listed for type-I diabetes.	0.3948314133514092
Whether the intravenous or the subcutaneous route is used for insulin, repeated glucose determinations are mandatory.	0.4871422985176683
If ketoacidosis develops the volume depletion is treated with normal saline.	0.40113633801089116
For hyperglycaemia and acidosis insulin (3 - 6 U - h-1) with 10 - 20 mmol - h-1 potassium phosphate is given.	0.7727656330091021
Bicarbonate is only indicated when the serum pH is lower than 7.1.	0.5894655814528881
It must be borne in mind that perioperative management of diabetes does not end with postanaesthesia care.	0.4050119540708788
At the beginning of the 19 th century, institutional care for the insane was established by the various German states.	0.5204296168725508
At first, the separation of curable and incurable patients influenced psychiatric care and the construction of hospitals.	0.5481850351682067
The combination of care and cure in one hospital in Illenau was a turning point in institutional care.	0.4515896657432816
Contradictory tendencies characterized the second half of the 19 th century: the integration with general medicine in the cities, on the one hand, the social separation and cure in the seclusion of the countryside, on the other.	0.6187317433221539
The characteristic psychiatric construction in different countries was influenced by individual architects.	0.32385194764753006
The following building styles were dominant: in England, panoptic architecture; in the United States, linear staggered structures; in France, the "carrés isolés"; and in Germany, the structure of blocks with cross-axes.	0.6580648914448729
At the end of the 19 th century, the system of pavilions was internationally accepted; occupational therapy and mental care in the countryside were introduced.	0.5129737807701046
From the First World War until the end of the 1960 s, a standstill in psychiatric buildings was noted in Germany, and institutional care came under increasing criticism.	0.5723442279119197
There was a reorientation from the middle of the 1970 s as a result of more effective therapeutic possibilities.	0.5653354658152694
A variety of complementary institutions, outpatient and partly inpatient therapies, which were recommended by the "Psychiatrie-Enquête", started to be realized.	0.5899054520708678
Smaller units and different models of integration of psychiatric care, such as building the hospital next to a general hospital or psychiatric wards within a general hospital, became relevant criteria for planning the construction of psychiatric hospitals, as did the integration into the community and the city.	0.5843267683810157
Principles of organization like the construction of a communicative quiet inner room, or grading the rooms from public to private, were structurally integrated.	0.49995631405084684
Specific structural requirements for the construction and design of psychiatric hospitals should be evaluated in more detail by post-occupancy methods.	0.5662812422990366
The coronal incision is a versatile approach to midface or skull base fractures.	0.3032139687164648
It allows the open reduction of complex fracture sites and facilitates canthopexy, marginotomy or calvarian bone harvesting.	0.39657545180635373
By this method, primary treatment can be optimised and the rate of secondary corrective surgery can be reduced.	0.6292819289351127
All trauma patients who underwent this kind of intervention were re-examined to check functional and aesthetic results.	0.5112337577251387
The complication rate was low and the advantages of these techniques are evident, so that it is suggested that the indication for this operative approach should be extended.	0.7657207918748001
One case of a newly described, rare odontogenic tumor is reported.	0.6767778440387856
A literature review of 19 cases lends support to the odontogenic origin and metastatic capability, both regionally and distantly, of the clear cell odontogenic tumor.	0.5833284569135948
We conclude that this tumor is malignant, with a tendency to recur locally after surgery.	0.6990632761391118
It requires an aggressive surgical approach and should be referred to as a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma.	0.5914763222451194
In our patient we saw a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma and a squamous cell carcinoma, both with regional lymph node metastasis.	0.7037910924135152
The histological differentiation of this type of tumor from other clear cell tumors is difficult.	0.4877348819497703
As the elderly segment of our population expands, there is an increase of therapeutic problems considering this age group.	0.6089580948234317
The elderly patient is generally susceptible to infections because of the decline in host defense mechanisms that occurs with aging, and the underlying chronic diseases of these patients.	0.6677444678588403
Increasing numbers of elderly people are being treated in hospitals and are additionally at particular risk of acquiring nosocomial infections with antibiotic-resistant organisms.	0.5382717233758461
This article focuses on the epidemiological considerations, risk factors, types of infections that occur in elderly patients, and the guidelines for empiric therapy.	0.6318103392937514
The most common infections of the elderly are respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and skin and soft tissue infection.	0.82442581782918
Empirical therapy should be broader in spectrum for elderly patients since the variety of infecting bacteria tends to be greater and the choice of antimicrobial therapy must be based on risk stratification (age, medical illnesses, and severity of presentation).	0.5782230112073568
Many additional aspects, e.g., route of administration, drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, drug toxicity and drug-drug interactions, compliance, and multiple underlying diseases (e.g., renal failure) must be considered in the rational selection of antibiotic regimen.	0.648853242895379
We present long-term results (minimum follow-up 5 years) in 145 patients with advanced non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, who underwent radical retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (RPLA) after chemotherapy.	0.7764670975156174
We correlated patients' outcomes (death of disease) to different kinds of chemotherapy and to intraoperative findings.	0.5775539030219697
We found that patients who were treated by a modified Einhorn scheme with cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin have a good prognosis.	0.6397495423919182
In all, 90 % showed no evidence of disease (NED).	0.7641906681166871
The NED rate was significantly lower in patients who were treated by sequential alternative chemotherapy (DOD = 37 %).We determined the following prognostic factors which predict a poor outcome:...	0.8353570042828018
Follow-up studies after stent implantation of native coronary arteries have reported reduced rates of angiographic restenosis.	0.5729954300046733
In contrast, stent implantation in the treatment of obstructive disease of coronary artery bypass grafts is complicated by higher restenosis rates.	0.6497806405215565
We sought to determine, if different predictors contribute to the high restenosis rate following stent implantation of coronary artery bypass grafts.	0.7424294887431664
We investigated long-term angiographic outcome of 205 stent implantations performed in 177 patients.	0.39271892671534486
Multivariate analysis correlated clinical, procedural and angiographic variables with the incidence of angiographic restenosis defined as diameter stenosis >50% at follow-up.	0.5538638402915034
Angiographic restenosis was observed in 34% of lesions treated.	0.7756350132030723
Multiple logistic regression analysis defined diabetes mellitus (OR 6.89, CI2.41-9.69), graft recanalization (OR 2.69, CI 1.08-6.63), lesion at the aortic anastomosis (OR6.98, CI2.76-19.25), lesion at the coronary anastomosis (OR 2.95, CI1.18-7.49), high diameter stenosis after stent placement (OR 7.01, CI 2.64-15.71), placement of long stents (OR2.78, CI1.11-7.36) and implantation of more than one stent (OR7.34, CI2.08-20.15) as independent predictors of graft in-stent restenosis.	0.6273228214776535
Critical consideration of these variables may help to identify patients who are poor candidates for stent implantation and who may benefit from different interventional approaches.	0.6898650970124662
To compare the conventional 2-D, the simulator-guided semi-3-D and the recently developed CT-guided 3-D brachytherapy treatment planning in the interstitial radiotherapy of breast cancer.	0.7080223200174314
In 103 patients with T1-2, N0-1 breast cancer the tumor bed was clipped during breast conserving surgery.	0.4660616279574108
Fifty-two of them received boost brachytherapy after 46 to 50 Gy teletherapy and 51 patients were treated with brachytherapy alone via flexible implant tubes.	0.4540579948842036
Single, double and triple plane implant was used in 6, 89 and 8 cases, respectively.	0.6695133109641113
The dose of boost brachytherapy and sole brachytherapy prescribed to dose reference points was 3 times, 4.75 Gy and 7 times 5.2 Gy, respectively.	0.6022245094676644
The positions of dose reference points varied according to the level (2-D, semi-3-D and 3-D) of treatment planning performed.	0.791241530436332
The treatment planning was based on the 3-D reconstruction of the surgical clips, implant tubes and skin points.	0.6925226079475707
In all cases the implantations were planned with a semi-3-D technique aided by simulator.	0.6093661419867664
In 10 cases a recently developed CT-guided 3-D planning system was used.	0.6355575297938447
The semi-3-D and 3-D treatment plans were compared to hypothetical 2-D plans using dose-volume histograms and dose non-uniformity ratios.	0.5828173710474439
The values of mean central dose, mean skin dose, minimal clip dose, proportion of underdosaged clips and mean target surface dose were evaluated.	0.5129722166494823
The accuracy of tumor bed localization and the conformity of planning target volume and treated volume were also analyzed in each technique.	0.5289196214676977
With the help of conformal semi-3-D and 3-D brachytherapy planing we could define reference dose points, active source positions and dwell times individually.	0.47065734323592534
This technique decreased the mean skin dose with 22.2% and reduced the possibility of geographical miss.	0.7312370302320106
We could achieve the best conformity between the planning target volume and the treated volume with the CT-image based 3-D treatment planning, at the cost of worse dose homogeneity.	0.6593191067319911
The mean treated volume was reduced by 25.1% with semi-3-D planning, however, it was increased by 16.2% with 3-D planning, compared to the 2-D planning.	0.9092151579081084
The application of clips into the tumor bed and the conformal (semi-3-D and 3-d) planning help to avoid geographical miss.	0.5531160484678412
CT is suitable for 3-D brachytherapy planning.	0.7683064228815755
Better local control with less side effects might be achieved with these new techniques.	0.5437258795965649
Conformal 3-D brachytherapy calls for new treatment planning concepts, taking the irregular 3-D shape of the target volume into account.	0.6774465467447021
The routine clinical application of image-based 3-D brachytherapy is a real aim in the very close future.	0.6192740381610679
Background: Staphylococci represent an important source of external infections of the eye.	0.4725645977000271
In addition to acute staphylococcal conjunctivitis a spectrum of subacute or chronic disease may be found.	0.5376605833960918
According to Valenton und Okumoto, with this staphylococci-associated blepharo-kerato-conjunctivitis in culture-positive cases S. aureus is found in 31% and S. epidermidis in 69% of smears.	0.6729277102391035
Microbiallergic and toxic mechanisms are the underlying etiology.	0.38404074570619845
Multiple organ failure (MOF) may occur early or late after trauma.	0.5582784414062596
Besides direct physical injury of organs, compromise of the microcirculation by inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MOF.	0.42059041445170586
Inflammation also induces counterregulatory responses which may end up in immunoparalysis.	0.29786936445512896
As a result, infection and sepsis with additional inflammatory damage to the microcirculation ensue thereby contributing to the late development of MOF.	0.5121794429029302
In addition to this biphasic model of posttraumatic MOF, there is evidence that inflammation and immunoparalysis do not only occur in sequence to each other but in parallel early after surgical procedures.	0.5844554769733754
The aim of the present brief review is to summarize the posttraumatic mechanisms of inflammation and immunoparalysis and to discuss how to differentiate between both pathophysiologic states.	0.7216778403152243
Early enteral nutrition is widely accepted for its support of organ structure and function ("gut injury hypothesis") and reduction of infectious complications and hypermetabolism in critically ill postoperative or postinjury patients.	0.6424586959725256
Nineteen severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score 40.3+/-11.6) were studied for the feasibility of early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube.	0.6575342919447617
Despite maxillary fractures, rhinoliquorrhea and blunt abdominal trauma the enteral feeding was mostly started immediately after trauma.	0.3656306897931542
Intermittent diarrhea or constipation resolved after reduction of the feeding rate within 1 or 2 days.	0.47910298237276006
Total enteral nutrition could not be realized in all cases; a central venous line was always additionally necessary.	0.6809282618444551
However, the goal was not complete enteral nutrition but a continuous enteral supply to maintain the integrity of the gut.	0.6313617348498507
The study has shown that early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube is also feasible in severely injured patients.	0.4319592064206896
The expenditure to overcome the technical and organizational problems seems to be justified.	0.5656191609114792
Enterally fed patients may have a better outcome that those in whom only parenteral is employed.	0.6232689649889201
Definition of the problem: The rapid pace of medical progress has drawn renewed attention to the various possible ways of treating dead or brain-dead pregnant women since the 1980's.	0.5516197604319936
The discussion today revolves around medical, social, legal and economic aspects.	0.49721886899129725
The historical areas of conflict which surrounded deliveries carried out on dead mothers (usually by means of a Sectio in mortua, nowadays known as a perimortem Caesarean section) and their significance in today's debate are, for the most part, regarded as being of little relevance.	0.6390873900451777
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is one of the most frequent infectious lung diseases in immunocompromised patients, especially in AIDS cases.	0.6964512523506302
The present case report describes pulmonary miliary microcalcifications with and without foreign-body reaction in a patient with successfully treated PCP who was known to have AIDS.	0.6334213760179285
This form of residues of completely healed PCP tends to be rare.	0.3994839365639757
Other infectious granulomas, foreign-body granulomas and sarcoidosis must be differentially diagnosed.	0.4021865515863013
After cautious decalcification, pneumocysts can be demonstrated with methamine silver (Grocott).	0.33893849865191594
It is important to be aware that PCP can also undergo spontaneous cure, so that miliary microcalcifications may then be the sole pointer to the presence of AIDS.	0.508454864326148
Background: In congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency high pre- and postnatal androgen levels are present and might influence psychosexual and psychosocial development in affected girls.	0.5040586504384155
Methods: In order to study the impact of high androgen levels as well as chronic medication and repeated surgery on female patients life we performed a comprehensive quality-of-life study.	0.5796767318900202
We report on the results obtained by structured interviews of adult patients (45) and their mothers (35) covering difficulties and problems in general, most aspects of their medical histology, self image, body image and current life with or without a male or female partner.	0.8342907033231564
Results: The patients were socially competent with a well developed social network.	0.7061863407873354
However, regarding sexual contacts they were shy and reluctant.	0.39993310991976144
These resulted in significantly less patients live with a partner or are married.	0.34865934750234334
Existing partnerships were more stable and satisfactory than in the control population.	0.631691162074818
The incidence of homosexuality was not increased.	0.3353449522871853
The number of women having children was significantly reduced.	0.43018573244754404
A substantial number of women suffered from androgen-dependent problems like irrgular menses and hirsutism.	0.3539738984235154
Mothers and patients denied any sex-specific eduction, but the girls had preferred boy-specific toys and competitive outdoor games.	0.4835959743911009
However, school performance was average and comparable to the controls.	0.6053757441297211
Most mothers expressed problems and questions regarding their daughters intersexuality at birth.	0.25792087460001006
Even though they felt they had received good medical treatment, mothers as well as patients felt they would have needed more psychological help.	0.4453133592815179
Conclusions: It seems that adult female patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia are able to adapt to their impairment and chronic disease.	0.6136554281043559
Problems regarding partnership, sexuality, and fertility remain and have to be addressed.	0.5685447756807022
Introduction: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has become an accepted treatment for end-stage liver disease.	0.6289154660942452
However, postoperative complications result in significant patient morbidity and mortality.	0.5559001331486944
Early detection and treatment of these complications is therefore of utmost importance.	0.6844341985426754
Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the postoperative complications of the patients who underwent OLT at our institution.	0.924572876140957
Duplex Doppler sonography and cholangiography were the primary imaging modalities in postoperative evaluation of the transplanted liver.	0.709747887344731
Other important techniques were CT, MRI, and angiography, which may contribute to a reliable diagnosis of vascular or biliary complications.	0.7944928768831261
Results: Second to primary organ dysfunction, vascular complications are the most frequent cause of graft loss.	0.6673772143441906
Thrombosis of the hepatic artery is the most common and most serious vascular complication, with a reported incidence from 4 to 42 %.	0.7941413256811394
Bile duct sludge, leaks and strictures are frequent complications after liver transplantation, which can contribute to graft dysfunction.	0.6249139171508671
Biliary tract complications usually occur within the first 3 months and require interventional radiological or surgical therapy.	0.5346999148139451
Since liver transplant recipients undergo immunosuppressive therapy, they are at increased risk of developing late post-transplant malignancies, which are best depicted by US, CT or MRI.	0.6974606895455475
However, radiological diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorder has to be confirmed by liver biopsy.	0.7019247725345675
Conclusion: Cholangiography and Duplex sonography are routinely used in the postoperative evaluation of patients with OLT.	0.7312767120104885
CT, MRI, and angiography are problem-solving tools in equivocal cases.	0.6327683575514177
Recurrence of colorectal carcinomas occurs in about 50 % of the cases with localized neoplasia.	0.7791321947217005
It is understood that the tumor recurrence is due to residual micrometastases not found during surgery or extraregional (peripheral blood or bone marrow).	0.47075853880184815
We developed a procedure to detect non-visible, abdominal metastases using a radiolabeled anti-tumor cell antibody injected before the operation (radioimmunoguided surgery, RIGS).	0.5028058901199742
However, even with the best technique, it is not possible to remove all micrometastasis if a hematogenic dissemination happens.	0.8258651017207637
Based on the knowledge of disturbing humoral immune reaction is mounted against shed tumor associated antigens (TAA), we developed a new method to reduce and correct the B cell response and B cell recruitment due to chronic TAA immun complex presentation on follicular dendritic cells (immune corrective surgery, ICS).	0.5312328332225326
This method is based on a selective lymphadenectomy.	0.769802428801556
The target lymph nodes were those loaded with TAA-immune complex.	0.38983083433764065
The detection method used was the injection of radiolabeled antibody able to recognize the immune complex.	0.45136047263672596
From 20 patients (stage I, II and III) treated with ICS, 17 survived more than 5 years ' showing a statistically significant increase of survival compared to patients treated with standard procedures.	0.7116211476747315
In conclusion, these data show that surgery of colorectal cancer should be selectively extended to specific anatomical regions in order to remove hidden micrometastases, and more importantly, correct postoperative immune processes that could suppress the T cell response against residual tumor cells.	0.6378245697991366
Knowledge of normal and impaired pulmonary gas exchange is essential to the anaesthesiologist.	0.6605548958794564
Analysis of an arterial blood sample allows evaluation of whether or not pulmonary gas exchange is normal.	0.5304809362767477
For this purpose comparison with the oxygenation index or the alveolar-arterial PO2 difference is helpful.	0.5895583475855701
Pathological changes of these variables are mainly caused by ventilation-perfusion (V.A/Q.)	0.5294871981219432
In daily practice, venous admixture or intrapulmonary shunt can be calculated using arterial and mixed-venous blood.	0.5849527506883904
By analysing arterial and expired PCO2, dead-space ventilation can be determined, but extended analyses of V.A/Q.	0.44083008146123454
distribution are not possible in daily practice.	0.590795740555067
However, knowledge of the principles of typical disturbances of pulmonary gas exchange in acute and chronic lung disease allows the use of therapeutic strategies based on the pathophysiological changes.	0.6775523403837799
Background: Infectious endocarditis can lead to embolic arterial retinal occlusions.	0.37805500555897886
The case of a 30 year old man with acatalasemia is presented.	0.5771380617061616
The congenital disorder  is charaterized by a lack or major reduction of catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water.	0.4361463311338075
The defect is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.	0.4348966183428476
Occasionally the defect manifests as progressive oral gangrene or Takahara's, disease.	0.2699697066285153
Poor longterm success has been reported for penile vein ligation the last few years.	0.4835311345122225
Therefore, we decided to re-investigate our group of 147 patients who were operated on between 1987 and 1996.	0.6674079748173681
All patients showed a negative response to intracavernous injection therapy at the time of diagnosis and revealed a maintenance flow > 15 ml/min, as well as a pathological venous flow with pharmacocavernosometry or pharmacocavernosography.	0.7234431828060142
These patients underwent ligation of all superficial dorsal veins and resection of the deep dorsal vein of the penis.	0.5644860196819473
An up-to-date record of the success of the operation was kept either by a renewed clinical visit or by a standardized telephone interview or questionnaire.	0.6181457030301583
A total of 126 patients were available here for long-term follow-up.	0.5098104112483125
We divided the findings into three groups: complete spontaneous erection, postoperative response to cavernous auto-injection therapy and no changes in erectile competency postoperatively.	0.47778675162251644
The short-term success rate for these groups after 1-3 months was an outcome of 31 (24.6 %), 25 (19.8 %) and 70 (55.6 %) patients; 86 % of the cases whose results deteriorated after the initial operation success rate had this happen within the first postoperative year (p K 0.001).	0.8757808527434175
Favorable prognostic factors were preoperative erectile dysfunction of K 7 years, a normal CC-EMG and a maintenance flow of K 45 ml/min.	0.5467683416771696
If all three parameters were present, the long-term success rate (spontaneous erection plus response to intracavernous injection) of 30 % of all patients was found to rise to 67 % in this selected group of patients (p K 0.001).	0.8658634068674906
This study reveals that long-term success for unselected patients undergoing penile venous surgery is disappointing; however, careful selection of patients by certain prognostic factors can improve long-term results.	0.5839901296547425
Pyoderma gangraenosum can cause great therapeutic problems.	0.2476950716935031
High dosed corticosteroids are the treatment of choice.	0.4217195690000399
However, recalcitrant pyoderma gangraenosum or side effects from corticosteroid treatment may require therapeutic alternatives.	0.36792425790712235
Pyoderma gangraenosum responds excellently to treatment with cyclosporine A.	0.36607257450656594
Because of side effects and drug interactions, the patients must be selected and carefully and closely monitored.	0.7672600832040855
Six patients with pyoderma gangraenosum, unresponsive to various topical and systemic therapies, were treated with oral cyclosporine A at mean daily doses of approximately 3 mg/kg.	0.5800445672239265
Marked improvement of the skin lesions and complete healing occurred in all patients over a period of 3-6 months.	0.9869387313551846
Only one patient suffered a relapse after discontinuation of the treatment.	0.5974313606487197
No severe irreversible side effects occurred.	0.26858473144659667
The results show that low-dose cyclosporine A treatment can be considered a first-line treatment of pyoderma gangraenosum.	0.8268023477205527
Medical treatment of injured patients by international missions of non-governmental organisations in crisis areas and out-of-area operations by troops, and also national disasters require special trauma management.	0.5023493236667766
Deviations from peacetime surgical guidelines are obligatory because of long-distance medical evacuation, the possibility of gaps in supply and the typical pattern of war injuries.	0.5163054165367242
Massive contamination combined with the high risk of infection is one typical attribute of wounds inflicted during a war or a disaster.	0.652078269837626
In contrast to peacetime surgical guidelines, aggressive wound débridement is often needed.	0.5051867861167633
Timely and prophylactically prescription of a broad-spectrum antibiotic with a long half-life has great importance in the treatment of these wounds.	0.5765131944831487
Suitable antibiotics for these indications are: piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriazon.	0.29457163684861987
Nevertheless the use of antimicrobial agents will only be effective with early surgical débridement.	0.39206281589686814
Craniofacial development may be potentially implicated after vault corrections in cases of craniosynostosis.	0.32682912663177766
The aim of this prospective study was the investigation of the surgical effect on calvaria growth, correlating the percentiles of a group of patients before and after craniosynostosis correction in relation to the normal percentiles of growth.	0.749765850019182
The patient population consisted of 71 children; the postoperative follow-up time in 57 patients was more than 12 months.	0.6963555884475373
Of the children followed up, 36 were male and 21 female.	0.6549137575895237
Thirty-six cases involved untreated non-syndromic craniosynostosis; the remaining 21 were syndrome cases.	0.5641787641612238
The patient ages ranged from 16 to 27 months.	0.2981986806809974
In 11 cases correction of an occipital craniosynostosis was carried out.	0.525187381195735
The fronto-occipital circumference was registered in accordance with Prader's percentile table.	0.3581131300441644
The operative method included a fronto-parietal craniotomy, the temporary removal and shaping of the fronto-orbital band and a vault cranioplasty.	0.4981550772797631
During follow-up 13 patients treated with fronto-orbital advancement in cases of isolated craniosynostosis remained in the registered percentile curve.	0.5390216955008957
In 13 patients a change to a lower percentile curve was confirmed; 1 patient changed to a higher curve.	0.7609744806544486
In cases of syndromic craniosynostosis 10 patients remained in the post-operatively registered percentile curve; 8 patients changed to a lower and 1 patient to a higher percentile curve.	0.6693863620120765
No growth restriction of the reshaped calvaria after surgical correction of craniosynostosis was observed.	0.3953679870759501
No significant difference was found in the potential calvaria growth between syndromic and isolated craniosynostosis.	0.7179415203418413
Today a large number of operative procedures on retroperitoneal organs can be performed using minimally invasive techniques.	0.6152764417305819
The retroperitoneal space can be reached laparoscopically through the peritoneal cavity or by the direct retroperitoneoscopic approach.	0.5228595672271323
The correct anatomical placement of the first trocar is of particular importance in procedures with the patient in lateral decubitus position in order to avoid injuries.	0.7461331575215356
The overview is worse than in conventional surgery because of the magnifying effect of the laparoscope, which is, furthermore, positioned very close to the operative field.	0.7261551049352207
It is therefore of great importance for the surgeon to use anatomical structures for orientation.	0.7164689009475557
The decisive anatomical aspects and landmarks in different minimally invasive operations on retroperitoneal organs are outlined.	0.359432494277554
Lipid peroxidation is considered a prominent feature of age-related retinal degeneration.	0.557459485546396

Based upon our increasing knowledge of mechanisms underlying tissue destruction in RA patients, new therapeutic principles have been developed, aimed at blocking proinflammatory cytokines or using antiinflammatory cytokines.	0.517493647218507
Both principles, however, have proven to be very effective.	0.6904038798552293
In addition, the availability of the methodology to transduce cells with genes has initiated first experiments in animal models to test whether gene therapy for arthritis is suitable, followed by a first, very carefully formulated protocol for human RA.	0.5907983000337352
Gene therapy for RA has to still be considered as an experimental form of therapy in a very early stage, not allowing even now any serious treatment offer to RA patients.	0.7505341771102493
Several problems, such as the question of a suitable vector system have not yet been solved.	0.6802609668319486
With more experiments this therapeutic principle might become available and might prove effective even in a disease with a systemic character like RA in the coming years.	0.5153371446373394

The news of success in ether anesthesia on 16 October 1846 in Boston spread like wildfire through Europe.	0.2475791216235125
In the German-speaking countries, the national newspapers as conveyers of the development played a prominent role; this was especially the case for the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung whose correspondent, Aloys Martin [1], was a medical professional.	0.6415530211328766
The function of local newspapers has not yet been investigated.	0.5247111032441295
This was to be remedied by examining both of Bamberg's local papers.	0.37870693139732003
All issues from 01.01. to 31.04.1847 were surveyed with respect to relevant announcements.	0.48691717425363534
These were then catalogued according to date, extent and contents.	0.3701369939927334
Starting on 22.01.1847, the events outside of and in Bamberg were reported on in 26 notices and articles of just a few lines to half a page and in advertisements; Aloys Martin also appears on the scene.	0.46881338825658936
Thus, the local press in Bamberg also informed its readers early and regularly on the discovery of ether and the succeeding events.	0.48893881494133495
True arterial aneurysms of the infrapopliteal vessels are a rare finding.	0.4040386163902822
During surgical treatment of convergent aneurysms of the popliteal artery and the tibiofibular trunk we discovered a complete spontaneous rupture of the thrombotic aneurysm of the right tibiofibular trunk.	0.6342878189343294

Unnoticed, minor damage to the unidirectional respiratory valves of the Draeger respiratory circuit may lead to intermittent and unpredictable malfunction, resulting in rebreathing and hypercapnia.	0.411966040912057
The damage may be so minor that normal visual and functional test routines may be insufficient to detect it.	0.35141032606634726
We report one case of a potential life-threatening malfunction of the inspiratory valve and also propose economical solutions utilizing altered construction, modified machine-check procedures, or a simple instrument that adds only one step to the machine-check procedure.	0.6024308933866508
The general problem of minor but functionally important damage to parts of ventilatory equipment - so-called borderline damage - may not be limited to this particular model or manufacturer.	0.5954420917032742
Most users of ventilatory equipment believe that equipment that goes through normal check procedures is either fully functional or non-functional.	0.3619711148999806
In reality, this is not the case.	1.010535265877623
Intermittent malfunctions due to slightly damaged equipment may be missed with normal machine-check procedures.	0.39144152595409676
This problem results in a significant but incalculable increased in risk to patients.	0.49750029711916494
Because of unclear reproduceability of intermittent malfunctions caused by borderline damage, there also is an increased forensic risk for the anaesthesiologist.	0.6249507053971856

Nonunion of the ankle malleoli is extremely rare these days.	0.598979168258198
This is probably due to the fact that primary osteosynthesis is performed in ankle fractures instead of the conservative treatment given up to 20 years ago.	0.7022383708369141
Today nonunions of the malleoli are seen, if at all, is infected cases after surgical procedures.	0.6258041077666124
Noninfected, stable and painless nonunions usually do not need any surgical correction.	0.3909532618888225
In painful cases, small fragments, especially of the medial malleolus, should be resected; larger fragments should be stabilized with two 3.5-mm cancellous screws.	0.7906889633562346
Alternatively, the tension banding technique, especially after Weber A fracture, produces high compression in the area of nonunion.	0.589988421885595
In cases of additional bony defects, a local upside down cortical-cancellous bone graft should be performed in addition.	0.7001031294043323
In summary, the therapeutic approach requires exact remodeling, bone-grafting and stabilization.	0.7089298829067207
Infected nonunions with loss of bone mass should be treated according to the guidelines for osteitis therapy.	0.7053695226597798

Data were collected from the therapists' case history (n=274), submitted to the first author as an expert of the statutory health insurance companies.	0.5336400436973862
We found a significant relationship between level of education and indication for psychotherapy.	0.6237222844864881
In our sample 43.5% had graduated from senior high school compared with 25.1% in the average German population.	0.6067652992905537
This relationship is getting more clear if we discriminate between psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.	0.33465347365399783
51.7% of the patients undergoing psychoanalysis had graduated from senior high school and only 13.2% from junior high school compared with 48.7% in the average German population.	0.6464173680583117
Also the duration of psychotherapy depends only on the level of education, not on gender, age or type of statutory health insurance.	0.7408930953153593
These results are discussed carefully and questions for further investigations are deduced.	0.617902523447243
After the initial enthusiasm subsided lasercoagulation of the prostate has been criticized because the extent of tissue destruction cannot be controlled and many patients may be expected to have significant postoperative obstructive as well as irritative voiding symptoms which may last for weeks.	0.6483144438514045
Thanks to new laservaporization techniques these disadvantages have been largely eliminated.	0.2723211221838527
With the Holmium laser a real resection of prostatic tissue is possible allowing the surgeon to see the prostatectomy defect immediately and to assess tissue destruction during the operation ("what you see is what you get").	0.5344911360807785
The postoperative voiding disturbances are diminished and comparable to those after TUR-P.	0.5110222399172548
The classification of acetabular fractures and especially the diagnosis of additional lesions can be misleading, when the personal experience is limited and the decisions are based only on conventional radiographs.	0.6873401442110302
The introduction of Spiral-CT with multiplanar reformations and 3-D views has improved the quality of visualization.	0.5650250352378547
Due to their higher costs, the need of these additional diagnostic tools is frequently questioned.	0.7110649634008477
This paper discusses the relevance of plain radiographs, 2-D-CTs, 3-D-CTs and Femursubtraction-CTs (FsCT) for the classification of acetabular fractures, based on a controlled study.	0.7930102874225986
Methods: Thirty physicians with different levels of experience in acetabular surgery were divided in three groups of 10 each: group I comprised residents without operative experience in acetabular surgery, group II was physicians with 3-10 years of operative experience, and group III was experts in acetabular surgery.	0.71881342738858
A total of 10 complete radiographic cases of high quality providing all levels of preoperative diagnostics (plain radiographs, 2-D-CT, CT with multiplanar reformation, 3-D-CT, Fs-CT) of different acetabular fracture types were prepared.	0.7391969486354765
The task for each candidate was to classify the fracture according to Letournel and to identify all additional injuries within the hip joint (e. g. marginal impaction, head fractures, etc.).	0.5191466988457377
The different diagnostic "levels" could be ordered stepwise according to personal need and no time limit was given.	0.45887406624471405
The case was finished when the candidate presented his final diagnosis.	0.3092317690728754
The use of the different radiographs, the preliminary diagnosis, the changes in diagnosis, and the final decisions were recorded.	0.9350314784899907
These findings were correlated with the different levels of experience and against a "consensus classification" which was generated by thorough discussion, and the use of intraoperative information and postoperative radiographs not accessible to the candidates.	0.7760252739224031
Results: The "correct" fracture classification based on plain radiographs was: group I, 11 %; group II, 32 %; group III, 61 %.	0.704573985242887
Based on 2-D-CT a "correct" diagnosis was reached by 30 % in group I, by 55 % in group II, and by 76 % in group III.	0.9759689417683343
With consideration of the "transient forms" in acetabular fractures based on Letournel and the 3-D-CT used mainly by group I, the rate of "correct" classifications rose to 65 % in group I, 64 % in group II and 83 % in group III.	0.827112376663907
The modifiers were diagnosed "correctly" in group I by 37 %, in group II by 56 %, and in group III by 73 %.	0.8754789002952796
The use of the 3-D-CT and especially the Fs-CT by group I resulted in an improvement in the rate of correct classifications to 61 %, whereas in group II the Fs-Ct was used only exceptionally.	0.8202921480927783
The 2-D-CT was the basis for the diagnosis of the additional lesions in acetabular fractures within all groups resulting in 73 % complete diagnoses in group III.	0.8128364242486616
This study showed the importance of CT for the exact analysis and classification of acetabular fractures.	0.5416822325726787
In particular, the secondary reformations in CT and the 3-D-views dramatically improved the rate of "correct" classifications in the group of surgeons with limited personal experience in acetabular surgery.	0.6654277195357979
This allows the less experienced an acceptable level of "correct" diagnoses, so that the treatment options can be weighed correctly.	0.5984485863479718
Among the "experts" a rate of divergent classifcations of approximately 20 % was observed, especially in "transient" forms of acetabular fractures.	0.7517623321841277
Background: Iridodonesis is the clinical sign of lens subluxation.	0.4044035674656579
Acute glaucoma caused by a ciliolenticular block may develop.	0.35325513150527266
YAG iridotomy or peripheral iridectomy are rarely effective in controlling intraocular pressure.	0.26479667115271593
The results of phacoemulsification and posterior lens implantation for subluxated lens and glaucoma are reported.	0.36273285468575595
Cerebral perfusion reserve may be determined by assessing changes in cerebral blood flow using vasodilators.	0.471530987935947
Transcranial Doppler (TCD) may be used to measure cerebral blood flow speed in response to such stimuli.	0.7003461009755848
The aim of this study was to analyze cerebral vasoreactivity in patients with high-grade carotid stenosis and to determine the short- and long-term effects of desobliteration.	0.7914375982766931
A total of 40 patients had bilateral preoperative studies done and 24 were re-evaluated 1 year later.	0.4987524825177238
The preoperative vasomotor capacity using TCD with CO2 was 57% +/- 45.	0.39349233324420624
Hemodynamic reserve did not decrease significantly in the early postoperative period on the operated hemisphere, and 1 year later hemodynamic reserve had increased to to 102% +/- 80%.	0.7125255340940932
One year later patients with unilateral stenosis (n=11) presented with a restitution of reactivity to 65% +/- 46% after initial postoperative ipsilateral decrease from 51% +/- 35% to 48% +/- 38%.	0.5955017947198338
Patients with bilateral stenoses (n=9) demonstrated an initial decrease from 70% +/- 60% to 48% +/- 21% and a significant rise to 115% +/- 77% 1 year later (P=0.02).	0.6465634332725277
Both the significant postoperative increase in the cerebral vasomotor capacity in patients with bilateral carotid stenoses registered in both hemispheres and long-term improvement in patients with unilateral stenosis underline the effectivity of carotid desobliteration in antiembolic prophylaxis and in cerebral blood flow increase, irrespective of the symptomatology.	0.5417140980739079
Chronic constipation can be divided in two large groups: slow-transit constipation, caused by pathological intestinal transit, and obstructive defecation disorder, caused by pelvic and rectal wall abnormalities.	0.5973339331617717
Videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are methods used to study dynamic evacuation of the rectum.	0.4491653863206445
Videodefecography also enables visual estimation of rectal evacuation.	0.34343969779540245
Defecoflowmetry allows analysis of anal and rectal pressures.	0.24429077262876142
Within this prospective study we utilized and compared these methods in 19 patients with slow transit and 30 patients with obstructive disease.	0.7030431043630607
In patients with slow transit, both investigations demonstrated a significantly higher defecation rate than in obstructive defecation disorder (slow transit: defecoflowmetry 65 %, videodefecography 80 %; obstructive defecation disorder: 50 % and 58 %).	0.617684919150306
The evacuation time was pathologically prolonged in both types of constipation, with a range of 43-55 s. Rectoceles are demonstrated in 94 % of cases with slow transit and in 72 % with obstructive defecation disorder.	0.7238507386227344
Also, we often found obstructive components in slow-transit constipation patients.	0.5096640203611742
Normal defecography or defecoflowmetry can rule out obstructive defecation disorder.	0.2311524625002069
We conclude that videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are important items in the complex diagnostic regimen needed in evaluation of chronic constipation.	0.4459870348934346
Absence of the septum pellucidum is a rare developmental disorder of the human brain.	0.8009856447927244
Previous reports focused on the association with other cerebral anomalies.	0.5292769278821486
We present MRI scans showing an isolated absence of the septum pellucidum.	0.36959602150277643
The patient was suffering from a schizophrenic psychosis.	0.688733487922538
Mental retardation or epileptic seizures, which are often found in more complex developmental brain disorders, were not observed.	0.831078739053199
The septal area is part of the limbic system and aplasia of the septum pellucidum could indicate developmental anomalies of the limbic system.	0.4300067290137233
The concept of cerebral maldevelopment and the limbic system in schizophrenic psychosis is discussed.	0.4715170462338369
History and clinical findings: A 61 year old man presented with newly developed tachyarrhythmia.	0.6781319199916215
Echocardiographically a tumour of unclear origin in the left atrium was diagnosed.	0.6440664485704667
Investigations: The heart rate in the ECG was arrhythmic at 146/min; intermittently sinus rhythm was established.	0.5830714130506466
Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a 90x50 mm tumour with sharp borders displacing both atria.	0.2636026359832493
The chest x-ray showed a mediastinal rounded mass in the dorsal part overlapping the right mediastinal border.	0.5029073094534151
Computer tomography was unable to discriminate the atrial wall from the tumour masses; hence the difference between an (intra-)cardiac tumour (i.e.	0.580599807673163
myxoma) and a tumour of extracardiac (mediastinal) origin could not be established.	0.6990495835785641
Additional magnetic resonance tomography led to the most probable diagnosis of a bronchogenic cyst, which spread ventrally up to the ascending aorta and dorsally to the paravertebral region, thus displacing and shrinking the left pulmonary artery and the left atrium.	0.8048353296931813
Therapy: For certain exclusion of malignancy and because of displacement of other thoracic structures the patient was operated on this mediastinal mass by anterolateral thoracotomy.	0.5546101907434143
Histologically a dysontogenetic, benign cyst with an inner layer of mesothel and nerval as well as vascular structures in the capsule was diagnosed.	0.4710630246157393
Since the operation the patient has persistent sinus rhythm without symptoms of relevant rhythm disorders.	0.5393514217794134
An overview of different kinds of intrathoracical cysts is given.	0.3877920169435779
Longstanding and untreated scaphoid fractures and scapholunate dissociations lead to painful destruction of the wrist with carpal collapse.	0.46167312195267496
The severity of degenerative arthrosis is classified in three stages and can be treated adaequate operatively.	0.5983079135888459
SNAC wrist (scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse) after failed fusion of the scaphoid and SLAC wrist (scapholunate advanced collapse) after scapholunate dissociation should be differentiated.	0.5398273613827754
The reconstruction of the scaphoid or scapholunate ligament in stage II and III is no reasonable option.	0.5660905423313677
Motion preserving procedures such as proximal row carpectomy or midcarpal arthrodesis are preferable in this situation.	0.3599891063638169
Thirty-one male patients (average 41 years) were treated for SNAC or SLAC wrist with midcarpal arthrodesis.	0.775354768335224
All patients were reexamined, the mean follow-up was 15 months.	0.8737093060881382
Grip strength was measured with the Dexter-System, pain was evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS 0-100).	0.694890914500361
Patients' daily activities and general quality of life were estimated with the DASH-questionnaire.	0.4531140720993629
Pain was reduced to 50% compared to the preoperative situation.	0.7944531301395867
Grip strength improved to 60% of the opposite side.	0.6018975948051808
Active range of motion reached 50% of the contralateral wrist.	0.713546835577037
Nonunion at the fusion site necessitated additional surgery in four patients resulting in total wrist arthrodesis.	0.4720798451751218
80% of the patients returned to their original occupation.	0.7709969253680118
Midcarpal fusion is a reliable procedure for treating the difficult condition of advanced carpal collapse is proper realignement of the carpus is performed.	0.4145193169409099
The DASH-score reflects the subjective impressions of the patients in daily life and justifies the choice of a salvage procedure preserving wrist mobility.	0.6398806181087546
Total wrist fusion represents the last line of defense.	0.2938200750848424
Stress fractures are one of the most common overuse injuries seen in athletes, accounting for up to 20 % of all injuries presented to sports medicine clinics.	0.756253621536292
Runners are particularly prone to these injuries, however, it is difficult to predict injury as there is usually a critical interplay between the athlete's biomechanical predisposition, training methods, and other factors such as diet, and muscle strength and flexibility.	0.6645834589136234
This article will discuss the key clinical findings for the majority of stress fractures encountered in a sports medicine practice.	0.5329252456005475
A classification scheme will also be described that will allow the clinician to make appropriate treatment decisions based on the degree of risk for each injury.	0.5344523072618262
Today, enzyme therapy with proteolytic enzymes still only plays a minor role in clinical practice, partially due to the belief that intestinal resorption of macromolecules is impossible.	0.49731032687605103
However, there is scientific evidence of intestinal resorption and a subsequent increase in proteolytic serum activity, and placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials have demonstrated positive effects of enzyme therapy.	0.6725267025542894
The documented effects include the reduction of oedema and resorption of haematoma, resulting in pain reduction and better mobility.	0.4692576773706895
There are indications to use such therapies in the areas of general surgery, traumatology, plastic surgery, and dental surgery.	0.6363888263035634
A further effect is higher tissue concentration of antibiotics in combination with proteolytic enzymes.	0.4652449482210044
In gynaecological treatments, enzymes are administered in breast surgery and to reduce the side effects of obstetrical injuries.	0.5576699159061296
Breast engorgement is a further indication for enzyme therapy.	0.34921051026281413
Further studies concerning enzyme therapy are justified because of the interesting possibilities offered by these substances and a favourable relationship between costs and benefits.	0.4830834512994981
High-frequency ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide represent - among others - two treatment options in hypoxemic respiratory failure of neonates.	0.6216919082177647
We report the case of a term infant with meconium aspiration syndrome, who only responded favorably to inhaled nitric oxide following the initiation of high-frequency ventilation.	0.6068248777785539
At an oxygenation index of 17 we started treatment with nitric oxide in order to reverse right-to-left shunting and improve oxygenation.	0.4727915658871872
How- ever the respiratory situation did not improve, the oxygenation index increased to 25.	0.4932500583186478
After discontinuation of nitric oxide the mode of ventilation was switched to HFV with mean airway pressures of 15 mbar.	0.4171883843592856
Again oxyena-tion was unaffected with an oxygenation index of meanwhile 31.	0.31254147406079874
At that stage of a second trial of inhaled nitric oxide was started at a concentration of 10 ppm while continuing high-frequency ventilation.	0.5450484142430465
Immediately oxygenation improved significantly, the oxygenation index decreased to 9 within several minutes after restarting nitric oxide.	0.4723863088527251
This effect on oxygenation was sustained for the duration of several days during high-frequency ventilation until gradual weaning from iNO could be performed.	0.5755468497792596
Learning microsurgery of the middle ear requires preparations of temporal bones.	0.4697843494795216
Ethical and moral restrictions in obtaining specimens make training and research with temporal bone preparations increasingly more difficult.	0.34861512865413385
Due to the complex structure of the temporal bone with its communicating cavities, the manufacture of facsimiles up to now has been impossible.	0.6801999931939507
Rapid prototyping techniques must be able to produce identical objects from an original one.	0.3303497027847075
By using CT scans of temporal bones from anatomic preparations and patients we have been able to reconstruct 3D pictures on a CAD workstation.	0.4856650966826041
We are now able to incorporate data in a stereolithographic system to create an anatomic facsimile of the temporal bone.	0.4730656580498603
It is possible to produce a considerable number of these facsimiles from the same real object.	0.5816874943677365
With this method we can produce models of human structure for medical teaching, training and research.	0.6019079241089733
Our artificial preparations of temporal bones correspond to both the material characteristics and anatomic details of human structures, allowing various surgical exercises to be carried out.	0.4842055377308096
During the past few years the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the most frequent of the rheumatic inflammatory systemic diseases has improved a great deal.	0.7942381048014203
The treatment strategy is based on the one hand on the so-called prognostic factors and on the other hand on the extent of the inflammatory activities, especially during the first phase.	0.8201518703012212
Numerous controlled studies and meta-analyses have enabled optimal application of the basic disease-modifying drugs, with regard to efficacy and side effects.	0.6225271725754168
During the first stage of these disease, the immunobiological substances against pro-inflammatory cells are employed.	0.6327295326187631
Improved knowledge of physiotherapeutic treatment, correct diet and careful observation of the patient's progress with the aid of questionnaires enable optimal care with regard to life quality.	0.590033392496721
Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi) occurring during mechanical ventilation depends on expiratory time constants, expiratory volume and expiration time as well as on external flow resistance (tubes, valves, etc.).	0.4681095751130749
It is not routinely determined in mechanically ventilated patients, but it is necessary to optimize respirator settings.	0.8171006446545019
The aim of the present study was the validation of an automated PEEPi determination method implemented in the respirator EVITA (Drägerwerke, Lübeck) in mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung failure.	0.719533490057919
The method was validated in ten sedated, myorelaxed patients with respiratory insufficiency of different etiologies (five with restrictive, and five with obstructive pulmonary disease).	0.6396644118389067
PEEPi was determined using the volume constant ventilatory mode at ZEEP or at an external PEEP of 5 as well as 10 cm H2O.	0.4564643420926012
PEEPi was first determined with the automated method implemented in the EVITA (five measurements at each end-expiratory pressure level; PEEPEvita).	0.5115891129207683
Steady-state was attained between each measurement.	0.28322092876392513
These values were compared to the results obtained with end-expiratory occlusion (external, computer-controlled valve in the inspiratory limb of the circuit) at the respective pressure levels (PEEPEEO).	0.7109817979873769
The average of five measurements at each PEEP level with each method was defined as PEEPi for the particular ventilatory situation.	0.5038501167162142
Gas flow was measured at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube with a heated pneumotachometer (Fleisch no.	0.42736231319891294
2, Fleisch, Lausanne, Switzerland) and a differential pressure transducer.	0.6876346543074069
Tracheal pressure was determined in the same position with a further differential pressure transducer (Dr. Fenyves & Gut, Basel, Switzerland).	0.5180262260800017
After A/D conversion, data were sampled with a frequency of 20 Hz and processed on an IBM compatible PC.	0.4761863216118522
Software for data collection and processing as well as for control of the occlusion valve was self-programmed.	0.5922531178616881
For the statistical analysis we used the Mann-Whitney U-test or Wilcoxon signed-ranks test; a P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.	0.5404772337071049
At the given respiratory setting and without PEEP patients with obstructive lung disease had a higher PEEPi (median: 6.4 cm H2O; range: 5.0 - 9.6 cm H2O) than those with restrictive pulmonary disease (median: 2.3 cm H2O; range: 0.8 - 3.0 cm H2O) (P<0.05).	0.8746380956298434
Increasing external PEEP to 5 or 10 cm H2O significantly decreased the pressure difference between PEEPi and external PEEP (P<0.05), but was unable to eliminate it completely.	0.5526662856950756
There was no statistically significant difference between PEEPEEO and PEEPEvita (P=0.43; Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests).	0.5189726232595434
Regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between PEEPEEO and PEEPEvita values (r=0.985, P<0.001; y=1.03x-0.18).	0.5090551801029489
PEEPi occurs during ventilation in patients with obstructive and restrictive lung disease.	0.4739478687553917
The difference between external end-expiratory pressure and PEEPi decreases with increasing external PEEP.	0.484467230214249
However, PEEPi may increase with increasing external PEEP in some instances.	0.4736890006753129
The reason for this may be that the PEEPi determined at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube represents only a mean value of different PEEPi values of various lung regions.	0.5553586703323026
Increasing external PEEP only partially alters this mean value due to an effect on PEEPi values lower than external PEEP.	0.4592680059876245
The PEEPi values measured by the EVITA respirator compared with classical end-expiratory occlusion with an external valve were nearly identical.	0.5156951594822226
Unfortunately, PEEPi measurement of the EVITA can only	0.5139769480191607
We report on the case of a 70-year-old caucasian woman with a large linear sebaceous naevus with multifocal intralesional basaliomas and a lipodermoid of the left eye.	0.6697342160952016
This rare finding has been preserved because of the special history of the patient.	0.6077272623129474
The naevus spread on the left side from parietal to retroauricular, nuchal and sternal.	0.41969926822233
Because of the patient's cardio-pulmonary insufficiency we excised the basaliomas under local anaesthesia.	0.5764694028687342
We also made a partial stripped excision of the left-sided parietal parts of the naevus.	0.7066270647800582
We describe an HLA-B27 positive patient in whom posttraumatic pyogenic sacroilitis led to complete unilateral sacroiliac joint ankylosis in the absence of any signs indicative of HLA-B27 associated spondyloarthropathy.	0.4683269153521385
Ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, has recently been shown, in a dose of 8 mg, to be superior to 1.25 mg droperidol in preventing postoperative vomiting.	0.8608832045953193
There are indications that a dose of 4 mg of ondansetron may be just as effective in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting as a dose of 8 mg [16].	0.6119419550879713
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and the adverse effects of 4 mg ondansetron in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting compared to droperidol in patients undergoing surgery with inhalation anaesthesia supplemented with alfentanil.	0.6215512545092594
Following institutional approval, 40 ASA physical status I and II women scheduled for minor gynaecological surgery gave informed consent to participate in this randomized, double-blind comparative study.	0.4901113822847248
Five minutes before induction of general anaesthesia, 20 patients received a single intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg of ondansetron and the remaining 20 received 1.25 mg droperidol IV.	0.6392141211440562
Anaesthesia was induced with 2.1 - 4 mg/kg of thiopental and 0.1 mg of alfentanil IV and maintained with 65% nitrous oxide and 1.5% - 3% enflurane in oxygen.	0.9478620973034877
On pain stimuli another 0.2 - 0.4 mg of alfentanil was given.	0.9035755241813135
Total effective antiemetic response was defined as the absence of nausea and vomiting for 24 h postoperatively.	0.5409362802183685
The incidence of nausea, vomiting and the number of patients showing total antiemetic response as well as the incidence of adverse effects were compared with the chi2 test and P<0.05 was considered significant.	0.6434733006955974
Patients were similar with respect to age, height, body weight and total anaesthetic agents received.	0.5192277835653988
Duration of anaesthesia and the time until awakening was not significantly different among groups.	0.8168970579259671
Postoperatively 7 out of 20 patients given 4 mg of ondansetron and 3 out of 20 patients with droperidol vomited (n.s.).	0.682054225624206
The incidence of nausea was 11 out of 20 in the ondansetron group, and 4 out of 20 in the droperidol group (P<0.05).	0.6073658458755362
Sixteen patients in the droperidol group and 8 patients in the ondansetron group showed a total effective antiemetic response (P<0.05).	0.5687487070576985
Postoperative sedation and well-being scores did not differ significantly among groups.	0.6446968962437792
Our results show that for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting 4 mg of ondansetron was inferior to 1.25 mg of droperidol.	0.5858891115550295
The drugs were given intravenously prior to general anaesthesia for minor gynaecological surgery with nitrous oxide and enflurane in oxygen supplemented with small boluses of alfentanil.	0.4608497148211855
A 66-year-old woman died of internal bleeding and pulmonary fat embolism following repeated massive blows from a wickerwork carpetbeater and an electric cable.	0.4406605294173217
The initial autopsy diagnosis was natural death.	0.2730851728357419
A second autospy on the exhumed body and an intensive criminal investigation revealed a long history of maltreatment by two sisters with whom the victim lived.	0.3820112716305676
The maltreatment occurred during exorcisms with the purported purpose of ridding the victim of her possession by Satan.	0.3335061241356052
The perpetrators and the victim belonged to the same pseudoreligous sect.	0.3644860990226495

Since 1993, 30 patients with acute distal intraarticular radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance.	0.5811724770446125
According to the AO classification there were 3 B- and 27 C-fractures, most of them Frykman VIII fractures.	0.7121863657100762
Of 30 fractures 23 showed additional lesions which could only be diagnosed under arthroscopic view.	0.4750168584384314
In particular, 12 partial or complete tears of the intracarpal ligaments were found.	0.517286996412188
Of 25 fractures 23 which were treated at least 12 months previously could be followed up radiologically and clinically.	0.5898647844891463
X-rays included postero anterior and lateral views to evaluate the radial angles and the radial length and stress tests to check for instability, especially of the scapholunate ligaments.	0.5999067354441182
Clinical examination included range of motion and objective grip strength measured with a Jamar (Cedaron) tester.	0.4289732470579011
Each test was performed on both wrists for comparison.	0.5666173897705513
Subjective data included pain and function for daily activities.	0.2938968137259612
Data were evaluated by the Jakim and the Cooney scoring system and the demerit point system by Gartland and Werley as modified by Sarmiento et al.	0.3724936150812287
About 70% of our patients showed an excellent or good result; about 15% had a poor result.	0.9442813715123632
However, we must mention that we were not able to reduce one C3-fracture under arthroscopic view and had to switch to a semi-open procedure with additional external fixateurs.	0.593585719556754
Arthroscopically assisted treatment of distal intraarticular fractures is not only useful to detect and manage additional carpal lesions, but seems to give good midterm results as well.	0.6186410720488532
Antitachycardia pacing techniques (ATP) have proved useful for termination of ventricular tachycardia (VT).	0.4987898971366116
However, little is known about the efficacy and safety off ATP during long-term follow-up in a larger study population.	0.6183561834606937
We analyzed the data of 80 ICD patients (pts) with spontaneous monormorphic VT, mean age 59  +/-  12 years, the mean follow-up was 26  +/-  17 months.	0.8754604057434463
50 pts (62.5%) had coronary artery disease, 18 (22.5%) dilative cardiomyopathy (DCM), the remaining 12 pts (15%) had no or other cardiac diseases.	0.7933463200553486
2926 episodes of ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 349  +/-  51 ms, 240-520 ms) occurred in 64/80 pts (80%), overall efficacy of ATP was 89.9%, acceleration occurred in 4.1% of VTs.	0.5603352489717293
Success of ATP did not correlate with positive ATP testing on induced arrhythmias, LVEF, NYHA class or aneurysm.	0.3483075647755648
Neither underlying heart disease nor antiarrhythmic medication had an impact on the ATP success rate.	0.38744557059934404
ATP efficacy was linked significantly to short VT cycle length (VTCL, 240-300 ms, p < 0.01) and long coupling intervals (91-97%), p < 0.01).	0.503621960632556
Acceleration occurred in 32% of pts and in 4.1% of VT episodes; it was also dependent on short VT cycle length (< 300 ms vs > 300 ms, p < 0.04) and short coupling intervals (< 81% vs >= 81%, p <= 0.01).	0.8645925932721022
Methodological work was performed in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) in order to develop suitable tools for non-invasive characterization of hematopoetic bone marrow.	0.6335118979858374

Discussion: Pure text-based clinical results do not allow sufficient evalutation for quality assurance and medical performance documentation.	0.4773711115455886
However, a computer-based and immediate documentation in outpatients' departments should not mean a significantly increased workload for physicians.	0.5386082684837153
Hydromorphone is a µ receptor agonist opioid.	0.25263195223220136
According to WHO recommendations, hydromorphone is to be classified in step III of pain therapy.	0.5879454056323613
An oral formulation with a prolonged duration of action of 12 hours has been evaluated only recently.	0.5348914595261545
The controlled release capsule is especially suited for the regular twice a day administration in cases of severe and persistent pain.	0.6191239474767464
The oral formulation of hydromorphone increases the number of opioid analgesics available for pain therapy in step III.	0.480972964003984
Hydromorphone is recommended when morphine fails to produce sufficient pain relief (despite increase of doses) or causes intolerable side effects (despite treatment of symptoms).	0.5126933817284104
In principle, no differences in efficacy of morphine and hydromorphone are to be expected.	0.6687227319378537
However, clinical experience shows that changing one opioid analgesic to another one can improve the treatment of patients so that hydromorphone may replace another opioid analgesic to which a patient fails to respond well or develops side effects.	0.5790486656512231
The dose of hydromorphone equivalent to 2 times 30 mg controlled release morphine is about 2 times 4 mg.	0.46535222157645995
The values for the absorption, bioavailability and maximum plasma concentration after the administration of controlled release hydromorphone every 12 hours -of three times the dose- are equivalent to those of an immediate release tablet given every 4 hours.	0.5963005054179026
In several open label and controlled studies, hydromorphone proved to be of good efficacy in the treatment of acute and persistent pain, especially in patients with severe cancer pain.	0.8030003937057169
With regard to the incidence of side effects, no significant differences between morphine and hydromorphone could be established.	0.7704055815855165
In general, the side effects of hydromorphone are typical for opioid analgesics.	0.6523950400820696
In 63 patients, 82 elevations of the maxillary sinus were performed.	0.49737699336948593
As augmentation, materials autografts from the iliac crest (combined with alveolar ridge augmentations in 16 sinus lifts) were transplanted in 39 cases and osteoinductive, allogeneic bone powder (AAA bone (autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogeneic bone): n = 8, DFDBA (demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft) and/or GraftonTM (demineralized bone matrix gel): n = 35) were used in 43 cases.	0.5526227355468317
Some 4-6 months after implantation, osteoinductive, allogeneic (demineralized) bone implants showed radio-opaque areas as an equivalent of bone formation.	0.6616549097019312
Histological examinations revealed that osteoinductive implants were completely transformed into patients' own bone tissue.	0.3794979472779974
The average augmentation height after autograft transplantations was 14 ( +/-  3) mm in comparison with 9 ( +/-  3) mm after allograft implantations.	0.7095631757452072
Histologically as well as radiologically no differences of the bone quality could be determined between the two augmentation materials.	0.7043011207490102
Endoscopic controls showed, in both groups, nonirritated mucous membranes.	0.5888645780253123
On an average 2 endosseous implants (Bone LockR or ITIR-screw implants) were inserted into the augmentated maxillary sinus floors in both groups.	0.5595590042396413
No osseointegration was achieved in 4 out of 67 dental implants when bone autografts were used and in 2 out of 74 dental implants of the allogeneic bone group.	0.535151902037417
Patients with bone autografts suffered from postoperative complaints on an average of 19 ( +/-  9) days (without consideration of 2 patients with postoperative complaints persisting for more than 90 days).	0.754751226165064
The average postoperative complaints of recipients of allogeneic bone implants continued for 3 ( +/-  5) days.	0.7233150041539486
The 13 patients who underwent an ambulant sinus lift procedure with allogeneic bone powder were already symptom-free several hours after the operation.	0.6193316799596341
Under critical consideration of all investigated parameters, osteoinductive bone implants are preferable to iliac bone autografts for maxillary sinus augmentations in those cases in which no additional alveolar ridge augmentation is required.	0.46147621459057303
We describe a patient with a primary renal plasmacytoma.	0.9132566907825759
In the literature available, only six clinical cases have been reported.	0.8139277205338241
A 64-year-old patient is presented who had the clinical signs of a renal cell carcinoma.	0.8926647521186741
Histological examination after nephrectomy, however, revealed a plasmacytoma.	0.47686219423162424
Based on this case, we discuss how one should proceed in this disease.	0.7298517798255402
Primary renal plasmacytoma can be tentatively diagnosed preoperatively only in the presence of paraproteinemia or Bence-Jones proteinuria, as it cannot be distinguished from other renal tumors by imaging procedures.	0.5695579654828766
Postoperatively, further staging procedures must rule out bone involvement (solitary myeloma or multiple myeloma).	0.4420426241250039
Nephrectomy is required in patients with plasmacytoma only if renal complications occur.	0.4145449365924142
Dissection of the ascending aorta (type A) following later after aortic valve replacement has been described with increasing frequency.	0.7680749169138029

Between December 1986 and November 1995, 222 patients with 225 acetabular fractures were treated operatively by three surgeons in the Department of Traumatology and Emergency Surgery of the University Hospitals of the Catholic University of Leuven.	0.590255102833954
Indications for surgery were unstable fracture, displaced fracture through the acetabular dome and fracture with intra-acetabular fracture fragments.	0.4783934098121654
There were 37.3% A-fractures, 49.7% B-fractures, and 13% C fractures according to the AO Classification.	0.7233882886171265
In 16.4% of fractures there were primary neurological deficits.	0.5815981059784078
Patients were treated operatively after an average of 5.0 days.	1.104880900461129
The Kocher-Langenbeck approach was used in 56.9% of cases, the ilio-inguinal approach in 27.1% and the extended iliofemoral approach in 4%.	0.7372242643462971
In 7.1% of patients, a primary total hip endoprosthesis was implanted.	0.8660119533866917
There was no intra- oder perioperative mortality.	0.5712261144932881
The average hospital stay was 26.1 days.	0.6782385707692269
In 7.1% of patients, we noted secondary neurological problems.	0.8282463182884787
Deep infections were present in 1.3%.	0.6502121733489766
In 11.1% of patients a second operative procedure was necessary.	0.8693679573353886
We were able to review 175 patients after an average of 2 years.	0.52784359710709
Signs of arthrosis and periarticular ossification were noted on the x-rays: walking distance, hip mobility and pain intensity were asked about and recorded after the clinical examination.	0.6157374333071369
In 76% of patients an excellent or good result on the Merle-d'Aubigne scale was obtained.	0.6737659990696858
T-fractures and posterior wall fractures were followed by the worst results.	0.5396946844950776
During this 9-year period, changes have been made to the preoperative radiological examination carried out, the choice of operative approach and our policy on prevention of thrombosis prophylaxis and postoperative ossification.	0.7243753311119566
After thorough preoperative diagnosis and with a meticulous operative technique, it is possible to stabilise the vast majority of acetabular fractures through the three classical approaches.	0.5936196444642429
Because the fractures are relatively rare, their diagnosis complex and their surgical treatment difficult, specific training is essential for every acetabular surgeon.	0.6453903287738335
Diagnostic pitfalls exist when benign salivary gland diseases are mistakenly classified as malignant, with consequences for treatment and prognosis.	0.5119012342377659
Examples are necrotizing sialometaplasia, metaplastic Warthin tumour and sclerosing polycystic sialadenopathy.	0.25910738794264343
The proper diagnosis is of eminent importance to distinguish cases of primary tumours that have developed in salivary glands or their lymph nodes from cases of extraglandular tumours with metastases in these glands or their nodes.	0.5273817324083665
In these cases clinical data and additional immunocytochemical methods are necessary to clarify the exact diagnosis, especially when the primary salivary gland tumours have a structure largely identical to the metastases (e.g.	0.6901655076431129
Nasopharyngeal or cervical chordomas can be mistaken for pleomorphic adenoma or mucinous adenocarcinoma.	0.2843088667807528
The initial stage of malignant MALT lymphomas in association with Sjögren's syndrome demands identification of clonal rearrangement for therapeutic implication.	0.35404016357880336
The diagnostic criteria for proper classification are analysed in detail.	0.5260675399345052
A 59-year-old male patient was transnasally operated on because of a pituitary adenoma with hypopituitarism.	0.5254957539862032
A second operation and X-ray therapy followed a half year later due to recurrent tumor.	0.5238848240776778
Both neoplasmas were classified as sparsely granulated prolactin cell adenomas.	0.2680643167292647
Immunohistochemical studies revealed strong immunoreactivity for prolactin and FSH in the tumor cells of both the pituitary adenoma and the recurrent tumor.	0.6507238722157921
Two years later the prolactin plasma levels were extremely elevated.	0.4188059801872866
A tumor in the liver was identified.	0.6315352793579436
Biopsy revealed a solid endocrine tumor containing prolactin by immunohistology.	0.2828730723826185
Due to structural and immunohistological similarities this tumor could be identified as a metastasis of the pituitary tumor.	0.5994862390127259
After 5 months of therapy the patient died from thrombembolism.	0.757419069994608
Post-mortem studies confirmed the diagnosis of a metastasizing prolactin-secreting pituitary carcinoma.	0.5417957603127258
Only six similar cases have been reported in the literature.	0.4923994228208097
Our case report confirms the experience with 35 definite pituitary carcinomas reparted in the current literature: malignant pituitary tumors develop after pituitary surgery and can be identified not from the pituitary tumor, but only from its metastases.	0.6722144719416482
Paraneoplastic markers in tumor patients may occur at various stages of the disease.	0.5225798885898806
While some disorders almost invariably herald an underlying malignancy (obligative marker), most only occasionally do so (facultative marker).	0.429337156968993
The association of bullous pemphigoid with malignancy is controversial.	0.41377997762305246
There are only a few reports of bullous pemphigoid associated with a renal cell carcinoma.	0.6950371974932522
We diagnosed a renal cell carcinoma in a 74 year old female patient, admitted to the hospital because of bullous pemphigoid.	0.614873855277786
Multiple metastases were found in her lymph nodes, liver, lung and skeleton.	0.6585736383617758
The patient died eleven weeks after the first symptoms of bullous pemphigoid appeared.	0.8490993809324877
Acute compartment syndrome of the thigh has been infrequently reported in the literature.	0.4405414087439054
Closed femoral fractures and blunt soft tissue trauma are the main causes of this injury.	0.6206187953823862
The multiple injured patient in this case report developed a compartment syndrome of the thigh after intramedullary nailing of a comminuted fracture of the femur.	0.6417541108408998
Fasciotomy was performed two days after surgery because of extense swelling of the thigh in the ventilated and sedated patient.	0.5087635297007923
Sciatic and femoral nerve palsy was recognized after extubation of the patient nine days after the injury.	0.613390801655795
During the following weeks the paresis of the femoral nerve recovered but neither motor nor sensory function of the sciatic nerve could be demonstrated.	0.6104149968413382
Therefore an operative revision of the sciatic nerve was performed eighteen weeks after trauma.	0.3705141401434858
No direct nerve injury could be detected but there were adhesions around the nerve as a sign of compression neuropathy caused by the compartment syndrome.	0.5477987395249685
The tibial component of the sciatic nerve showed a complete recovery within the next months but there was a persisting peroneal nerve palsy.	0.6408707044043553
Conclusion: Early clinical symptoms of a compartment syndrome like pain, paresthesia and paresis can not be ascertained in a ventilated and sedated patient.	0.48137608215473665
Tense swelling of the muscles is often the only detectable sign.	0.4875192341785746
Frequent measurements of compartment pressure should be done in these patients.	0.5486862793745892
We suggest early decompressive fasciotomy because the morbidity caused by fasciotomy in a borderline compartment syndrome is far outweighed by the morbidity that accompanies an undiagnosed untreated compartment syndrome with possible nerve palsy.	0.4075958092506497
Aim: The long-term effect of DNase with cystic fibrosis was examined.	0.5071617820890469
Teeth are most important for the identification of unknown cadavers.	0.4524946252933434
The police publish difficult cases of unidentified bodies in dental print media.	0.3021074359572562
Using their records such as x-rays or documented dental work dentists can often recognize an unknown person and thus contribute to the identification.	0.4871106638538182
To evaluate the efficency of this procedure 177 cases published between 1975 and 1995 were examined.	0.5085344591277984
Only 3% of the examined cases could be identified due to a reaction to publishing in the dental print media.	0.6696902507040909
To improve the presentation of identification cases in the dental print media 500 dentists were asked to take part in a survey.	0.571031675481664
According to these results a new concept of presentation sould be developed to improve the efficency of this odontoforensic method.	0.5749949330414988
New technological possibilities such as digital x-raying or online data transfer could open new ways for forensic identification.	0.27334688301764715
In a fatality after oral intake of a large amount of an insecticide spray consisting of propoxur, tetramethrine and the solvents isopropanol and benzyl alcohol, a coagulation nectrotic fixation of the oesophagus and stomach were the main morphological findings.	0.5009709272435446
The concentrations determined by HPLC and GC/MS in femoral blood, liver, kidney, vitreous humor and liquor were in the comatose lethal range for propoxur (< 0.3-18 µg/g), whereas tetrametrin (up to 0.1 µg/g) was almost completely decomposed.	0.646794122849045
The propoxur decomposition product o-isopropoxyphenol (2.8-56 µg/g), benzyl alcohol (18-58 µg/g) and its oxydation product benzoic acid (85-140 µg/g), isopropanol (0.45-1.1 mg/g) and acetone (0.01-0.03 mg/g) were also found.	0.7465608078741521
On the other hand, the concentrations in heart blood and lung tissue were up to 30 times higher.	0.5260440762230945
As a reason for these immense concentration differences an agonale aspiration of the highly concentrated liquid stomach content after vomiting immediately before death is discussed.	0.39134650086280376
The extent of the metabolization of propoxur to o-isopropoxyphenol and of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid, which is assumed to proceed mainly postmortem, was quite different in the materials investigated and was almost complete in the liver.	0.6004505837942316
The intoxication by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor propoxur in combination with the neurotoxic effect of tetramethrine was determined as the cause of death.	0.4636599326216275
Background: Despite the fact that deep lamellar keratoplasty (DLKP) is less invasive than to penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), this procedure is rarely performed.	0.6842295028820107
We therefore investigated whether or not the DLKP technique we employed can achieve stable improvement of visual acuity.	0.4109663583100698
Palmoplantar keratodermia (PPK) varians and PPK punctata are considered different entities within the group of hereditary palmoplantar keratodermas.	0.3590086658434108
Keratosis punctata of the palmar creases constitutes a localized form of keratodermia palmoplantaris punctata.	0.33878070569320223
We describe a 31-year-old man exhibiting both nummular and papular keratoses on the soles, as well as small punctate keratoses confined to the palmar creases.	0.5355259970903085
In view of the co-occurrence of these two types of PPK, the question arises whether keratosis palmoplantaris of the varians and the punctate type represent distinct entities or represent variable manifestations of the same gene defect.	0.6062934137104966
The author gives a synoptic view on the paths and routes of emigration the jewish and/or political reasons persecuted psychoanalysts had to take in order to escape national socialist Germany.	0.38631606923589096
With reference to current studies on emigration, which for Germany differentiates three distinctive phases of emigration between 1933 and 1938, the immigration policy especially of the United States and Great Britain and its impact on the concrete circumstances and modalities for the emigration of the particular professional group of psychoanalysts is described and discussed.	0.5431388410289562
In this context, the major importance of the solidarity and help the refugees were granted by the international psychoanalytic community and performed in spite of partially major theoretical differences and institutional rivalries is emphasized.	0.5393740111354305
Acute suppurative thyroiditis is very rare in childhood.	0.4335938188153319
We describe the clinical signs and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of thyroid abscesses in children, and add 2 own cases of this rare disease.	0.8410308158693799
In the first case, diagnosis of piriform sinus fistula was made finally after repeated drainage for recurrent abscesses of the left thyroid.	0.777969950288184
Operative excision of the fistula was performed and the child is doing well since then.	0.6742214191734585
In the second case, a left sided thyroid abscess was treated by incision and drainage only.	0.7160879411325094
Seven years later, no recurrent abscess occurred in this child.	0.5695485028982751
In conclusion, especially in left sided and recurrent thyroid abscesses the patients should be examined for a piriform sinus fistula as a route of infection.	0.5512627792968028
If present, complete removal of the fistula is essential for permanent cure.	0.7320309877857092
The importance of spiral-CT is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors.	0.3581899904451724
Its importance for follow-up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors.	0.3837829580115184
Using spiral-CT multiple signs of alterations (n=98) can be diagnosed, which are not only important for tumour relapse, but also for assessment.	0.6754717326396523
Spiral-CT offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy.	0.4047550707548655
In follow-up examinations after radiation, laryngoscopy and spiral-CT are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath-holding technique (separately reconstructed) and also as functional spiral-CT of the vocal cords in "I"-phonation.	0.4601500446277371
Simpson in Scotland was the first to describe the administration of ether for analgesia in painful deliveries.	0.5881952240869899
Only a few days later E.C.J.	0.709006984686559
von Siebold (*1801 in Würzburg - \dagger1861 in Göttingen) performed the first systematic study on ether in obstetrics.	0.6240414512260808
Following a preceding evaluation of the action of ether on non-pregnant woman and on pregnant women not in active labour, he administered ether for analgesia during the second stage of labour in eight parturients.	0.5454549063487355
The first administration was on February 25th 1847.	0.25422747060964734
While he was satisfied with the good analgesia without sequelae of the new-born, he was discouraged by the termination of uterine contractions observed in all his patients.	0.5907913187437741
He concluded that ether was not a useful substance for analgesia during vaginal delivery, since it disturbed the natural course of labour.	0.5245124359100721
On the other hand, von Siebold was very pleased with the administration of ether for operative obstetric procedures such as forceps deliveries or placental retention.	0.39500896986917217
Background: Mode switching aims to maintain a ventricular rhythm that matches metabolic needs during both sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias.	0.5018112553009358
This allows patients with atrial arrhythmias to benefit from AV synchronous pacing modes.Aim and method: Beat-to-beat mode switching in Diamond and Clarity pacemakers is designed to maintain a relatively stable ventricular rhythm, ensuring consistent ventricular filling patterns.	0.4803235124324374
Atrial tachyarrhythmia detection is based on a continuous analysis of the atrial rhythm.	0.741290097621344
A too rapid increase of the atrial rate with a beat-to-beat acceleration > 15 bpm is considered to be an atrial tachyarrhythmia.	0.7346565151235658
Mode switching occurs on detection of the first premature atrial event: atrial tracking is stopped and the ventricular rate is determined by the rate indicated by the dual sensor (QT interval and activity).	0.563893420096601
Atrial pacing restores AV synchrony immediately after cessation of the atrial tachyarrhythmia, effectively avoiding retrograde conduction.	0.44794014586101016
Dedicated diagnostic functions allow one to monitor the incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias and to study atrial and ventricular events just prior to its onset.	0.5572562076954771
Both the mode switching and rate responsive function are fully automatic, rendering follow-up procedures easy and less time-consuming.	0.5304495045198512
Conclusion: Reliable detection of all atrial events is essential to guarantee appropriate mode switching.	0.49090484505438936
Therefore, the pacemaker stores the distribution of the amplitude of all atrial events, both during sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias, which facilitates the appropriate programming of the atrial sensitivity.	0.7857168210155344
Introduction: Mediastinal diseases are mostly diagnosed by CT and MRI.	0.5051270759443347
The applicability of ultrasound is limited by the surrounding air- and bone-containing thorax, which permits only restricted echo windows.	0.6970248079830271
Transesophageal endoscopic ultrasonography circumvents this problem and ensures visualization of parts of the mediastinum.	0.4108222881094814
Blood glucose alterations prior to cerebral ischaemia are associated with poor neurologic outcome, possibly due to extensive lactic acidosis or energy failure.	0.5187879875987255
Cerebral effects of hyper- or hypoglycaemia during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are less well known.	0.5736753315808512
In addition, little information is available concerning cardiac effects of blood glucose alterations.	0.5211045782036469
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pre-cardiac-arrest hypo- or hyperglycaemia compared to normoglycaemia upon haemodynamics, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism (CMRO2), and regional cardiac blood flow during CPR subsequent to 3 min of cardiac and respiratory arrest and after restoration of spontaneous circulation.	0.6108308905951891
After approval by the State Animal Investigation Committee, 29 mechanically ventilated, anaesthetised pigs were instrumented for haemodynamic monitoring and blood flow determination by the radiolabeled microsphere technique.	0.44723407085225897
The animals were randomly assigned to one of three groups: in group I (n=9) blood glucose was not manipulated; in group II (n=10) blood glucose was increased by slow infusion of 40% glucose to 319 +/- 13 mg/dl; in group III (n=10) blood glucose was lowered by careful titration with insulin to 34 +/- 2 mg/dl.	0.7335348992774
After 3 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation and respiratory arrest, CPR (chest compressor/ventilator (Thumper) and epinephrine infusion) was commenced and continued for 8 min.	0.6044488764124776
Thereafter, defibrillation was attempted, and if successful, the animals were observed for another 240 min.	0.6829633858568581
Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), CBF, CMRO2, coronary perfusion pressure (CorPP), and regional cardiac blood flow were determined at control, after 3 min of CPR, and at 10, 30, and 240 min post-CPR.	0.7198002528230385
In group I, 4/9 animals (44%) could be successfully resuscitated; in group II 4/10 (40%); and in group III 0/10 (0%).	0.8583573490650145
Prior to cardiac arrest, mean arterial pressure, CPP, and CorPP in group III were significantly lower compared to groups I and II.	0.7386649090491965
In group I, CPP during CPR was 26 +/- 6 mmHg; CBF 31 +/- 9 ml/min/100 g CMRO2 3.8 +/- 1.2 ml/min/100 g; CorPP 18 +/- 5 mmHg; and left ventricular (LV) flow 35 +/- 15 ml/min/100 g. In group II: CPP=21 +/- 5; CBF 21 +/- 7; CMRO2 1.8 +/- 0.8; CorPP 16 +/- 6; and LV flow 22 +/- 9; and in group III: CPP 15 +/- 3; CBF 11 +/- 8; CMRO2 1.5 +/- 1.1; CorPP 4 +/- 2; and LV flow 19 +/- 10.	0.7555672509393963
During the 240-min post-resuscitation period, there were no differences in CBF, CMRO2, or LV flow between groups I and II.	0.6511652855678317
Hypoglycaemia prior to cardiac arrest appears to be predictive for a poor cardiac outcome, whereas hyperglycaemia does not impair resuscitability compared to normoglycaemia.	0.5728230810402617
In addition, hyperglycaemia did not affect LV flow, CBF, or CMRO2.	0.49126659483709545
However, it has to be kept in mind that haemodynamics and organ blood flow do not permit conclusions with respect to functional neurologic recovery or histopathologic damage to the brain, which is very likely to be associated with hyperglycaemia.	0.7184783585512632
Abstract  We present an algorithm for the rational diagnosis of glutaric aciduria type I (GA1).	0.5129688432447012
Normal urinary organic acids in patients with non-specific clinical features and normal results of brain imaging render the diagnosis highly unlikely, and no further investigations are required.	0.6673091181117304
In other patients, the diagnostic strategy depends on the individual clinical, neuroradiological and biochemical findings.	0.7336396149804277
GCDH enzyme analysis should be reserved for patients in whom GA1 is very likely.	0.47079292616482843
This article gives a brief review of the history of spinal surgery from the end of the nineteenth century up to our own time.	0.5975152073709215
Malignant lymphomas, originating from peripheral T or NK cells, are rare tumours in Europe and account for less than 10% of all malignant lymphomas.	0.7638924391823126
In this review, the salient features of the more frequently occurring entities derived from T or NK cells will be presented.	0.6048344811589903
Nasal NK/T cell lymphoma is mainly found in the nose and paranasal sinuses and often, but not always, display an angiocentric growth pattern leading to coagulation necrosis.	0.6189281643720775
The tumor cells consistently express CD56, CD2 and the EBER molecules encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus.	0.38610407310598865
Clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangements are often absent indicating, in the majority of cases, a derivation of these tumors from NK cells.	0.6383807837489633
Enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphomas often arise in patients with celiac disease and have a dismal prognosis.	0.565132384795317
The tumour cells express T cell antigens, CD103 and cytotoxic molecules, but are negative for CD4.	0.5932157899403308
Approximately 20% of the cases display CD56 mostly in combination with CD8.	0.6631250036445518
Recently, an early purely intraepithelial form of this tumour was identified.	0.7266214474901875
Histologically these cases resemble celiac disease, however the intraepithelial lymphocytes often exhibit an abnormal immunophenotype with absent CD8 and T-cell-receptor protein expression, and, they are clonal by molecular analysis.	0.6654521862035316
Clinically, the patients suffer from refractory sprue or ulcerative jejunitis.	0.6832991400482515
The prognosis is bad with the patients often dying from malnutrition or an invasive tumour-forming T-cell lymphoma.	0.643156410612378
Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is defined by characteristic morphological findings (atypical lymphoid cells in part with pale cytoplasm, arborizing high endothelial venules and large FDC-meshworks) as well as clinical features (systemic symptoms, signs of a dysregulated immune response).	0.5429836389812239
Peripheral T-cell lymphomas, that do not fit into a distinct entity, are classified in the REAL and the new WHO classifications as peripheral T-cell lymphomas unspecified.	0.7319102863601042
These display a broad morphological spectrum (including the T-cell lymphomas of different cell sizes, Lennert's lymphoma and T-zone lymphoma of the Kiel-classification) and in general are clinically aggressive.	0.7116959174857476
Causes and courses of the diseases are subjected to a change of an increasing life expectancy on the one hand and technically highly developed medicine on the other hand.	0.5919675765536244
Since a growing number of elderly people is denying intensive medical interventions which serve the purpose of keeping them alive despite severe diseases, the problem of euthanasia imposes direct questions.	0.5303116733739852
A central role is played by the active-passive difference and its moralistic legitimacy.	0.45241327326015435
The difficulties of this difference are discussed below on the applicable level of ethical discussions.	0.41981488299894254
At the same time, knowledge of the danger is being made aware that in a maximal therapeutical orientated medical care system the desire for euthanasia may become identical with the reverse side of this care system.	0.5427662064900424
Isolated severe head trauma (SHT) or SHT in combination with multiple injuries are important factors for the prognosis of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from the consequences of accidents.	0.733044591089396
The prognosis mainly depends on the presence of primary mechanic brain injury and the development of secondary brain damage.	0.488875230387945
Causes for the development of secondary brain damage are the intracranial space demand after traumatic injury and edema formation which may result in iscemia, as well as inflammatory processes.	0.4522625583380303
Both isolated SHT and polytrauma with or without brain damage may result in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to the synthesis of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators which may cause a single or multiple organ failure (MOF).	0.6012567105427438
Often the organism is able to survive isolated traumatic injuries and functional disturbances, but in combination or cumulation they may be lethal.	0.6545167383418037
The hypermetabolism after SHT is often regarded as an interaction between the central nervous system and the whole organism by the activation of the neuroendocrine axis.	0.6429764374511705
In contrast to the consequences of SHT for the whole organism, multiple injuries after polytrauma may affect brain functions, such as the shock dependent disturbance of the brain perfusion accompanied by brain hypoxia which may lead to an aggravated prognosis.	0.6449497308795563
Moreover, coagulation, metabolism and fracture healing are influenced by the onset of SIRS as well.	0.4890011845077831
Our knowledge about the bidirectional inflammatory interaction between brain and whole organism is still limited.	0.5275146941132893
In this context, the effects of secondary surgical interventions which may additionally stress a traumatized body have to be considered and are the subject for actual clinical discussions and experimental studies.	0.6241911058745503
This article tries to summarize some important aspects on this topic.	0.2971010664655441
Background: Chronic cough and thoracic pain, commonly caused by upper airway infections, are frequently seen symptoms in pediatrics.	0.6273731883812304
These "benign" symptoms are very seldom caused by malignant disorders.	0.3912073562652
Methods: In two patients (male, age 41/12 and 43/12 years) chronic cough and thoracic pain were due to a malignant pulmonary neoplasm (Pleuropulmonary blastoma).	0.6491171919184777
Results: Pleuropulmonary blastoma is a rare malignant primary pulmonary neoplasm in childhood with a poor prognosis.	0.5852594984164009
An incomplete resection was performed in both cases.	0.7945534239641532
Both patients received postoperative radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy.	0.39454264350677526
One boy died, the other one is alive and well more than 6 years after diagnosis without evidence of disease.	0.800814472735472
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that even after incomplete resection subsequent multimodal therapy (adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy) can provide a long term remission.	0.6683226496559387
In 12 patients with systemic sclerosis the influence of hypnosis and autogenic training on the acral blood circulation and the coping with the disease was investigated in a pilot study.	0.6696754129572832
In the first step significant increases in the skin temperature of the fingers (mean +/- SD: 3.9 +/- 1.2  °C) could be found after relaxation hypnosis.	0.9151223753255833
In the second step six patients (study group) gained experience with autogenic training.	0.5531547140491988
The other six patients served as control group.	0.26323644101318533
In the study group, the skin temperature of the fingers (short-term effect) was significantly higher than in the control group (1.9 +/- 1.0  °C).	1.0174783112668278
Long-term effects of the autogenic training (mean acral rewarning time, duration and course of the Raynaud attacks, acral lesions of the hands, psychosomatic status of complaints, type of relation to the disease as precondition for coping with the disease) were not found within the relatively short follow-up period of 4 months.	0.864774380270378
Two patients, however, reported that they could shorten the duration of Raynaud attacks by autogenic training.	0.390474488586515
In our patients heterogenicity and an increased score of multiple psychosomatic complaints were registered at the outset.	0.5691723497142445
As far as the type of relation to the disease is concerned, the patients could be assessed as almost adapted.	0.8690477251359008
Hypnosis and autogenic training can be recommended as complementary therapy in systemic sclerosis.	0.5059421469326931
Abstract The term acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reflects an acute worsening of the stable state with an increase in dyspnea, cough, and count or purulence of sputum.	0.5175017435903502
The management of an acute exacerbation is guided mainly clinical severity which has implications on the decision of outpatient management, hospital management or intensive care treatment.	0.6076837469199062
Cardiopulmonary comorbidity and the number of previous exacerbations are prognostic factors.	0.33013511369923526
The first-line therapy of each exacerbation is the intensification of drug-treatment with 2-agonists and anticholinergics.	0.6555442320836191
Systemic steroids as a short-term course are advocated if hospital-treatment is necessary.	0.6539290356176053
Infections of the respiratory tract are a frequent cause of acute exacerbations.	0.7481019071504983
However, a colonization with potential pathogenic microorganisms is found in many patients in the stable state.	0.7279972648596502
Antibiotic treatment is justified if cardiopulmonary comorbidity and frequent previous exacerbations are present.	0.5226617461027334
The severity of airflow obstruction and the frequency of previous exacerbations are linked to the spectrum of the underlying microorganisms.	0.6184667701719955
This should be borne in mind for the choice of the antimicrobiotic treatment.	0.4854465937275556
Noninvasive ventilation in severe exacerbation is able to improve gas-exchange and to reduce the work of breathing.	0.5419060334649579
As a consequence the number of intubations and the attributable morbidity and mortality are reduced.	0.6564527374806627
If invasive mechanical ventilation is necessary, the potential of dynamic hyperinflation in acute exacerbation has to be considered.	0.7369945823122372
Background: In 1986 Prof. H. Olbing (University of Essen Pediatrics Department), supported by Prof. G. Stickler (Mayo Medical School, Minnesota), introduced a 4-weeks clinical skills lab for all students (annual class 250), based on self-instruction by means of computer-assisted, interactive, audiovisual learning materials, models, bedside teaching and seminars on special topics (partially peer-guided).	0.4658765079683858
Each year 14 chosen senior medical students get a two weeks intensive training in order to function as peer tutors for the bedside teaching.	0.41068649911792576
The peer tutors train the junior students in basic behaviour and clinical examination skills.	0.3167932864993513
Each tutor is active during 4-5 skills lab periods, and in each period he/she coaches two groups of two students each.	0.6440881365274593
During the bedside teaching phase each group examines and presents four patients.	0.2917658357377452
Spinal injuries referring to banal falls are common injuries in elderly persons.	0.4411011495806093
Up to 55 years of age spinal fractures are more frequent in men while its opposite in older persons.	0.5268119165326869
There are two typical lesions: odontoid fracture in the upper cervical spine and compression fracture in thoracolumbar spine.	0.589933696322052
Odontoid fracture is the most frequent lesion in cervical spine in the elderly.	0.71726553605875
This is caused by trabecular structure of dens axis and spine's stiffness in old age.	0.3433642821692029
Instable fractures in extension type II are most common.	0.41231160932426275
In many cases the instability of the lesion is hidden and can be first seen in functional examination controlled by x-ray.	0.6523877279691858
Conservative treatment is efficient in stable lesions type III while there is a high risk for pseudarthrosis in treatment of instable lesions in elderly with Halo Fixateur e. g. We think that the best operation for these fractures is the anterior screw fixation.	0.6041794511767435
If this is not sufficient because of low bone mass or early dislocation of the screws a dorsal fusion C1/C2 with transarticular screwing e. g. should be done.	0.6144206614644407
Because of rare symptoms thoracolumbar fractures in osteoporosis are hidden frequently.	0.3339584823773262
In many cases it's not easy to distinguish acute lesions from healed fractures or tumor lesions.	0.47130939135729844
Therefore there are just few compression fractures (A type) that have to be treated operatively.	0.7803606017441129
Instable lesions type B and C must be operated as well in the elderly as in the young.	0.73696181711337
Because of low bone mass in elderly the dorsal instrumentation should include more than just the two injured segments.	0.38232460569316445
An even more adequate stabilisation is done with an additional vertebral replacement.	0.4453337359261832
Following curative minimal-invasive laser resection of T1-T3 laryngeal carcinomas, patients were subjected to an intensive voice rehabilitation.	0.5504251943679676
Therapy was effected twice a day for approximately 2 months, utilizing the concept of functional voice therapy.	0.47668187120068495
Before and after rehabilitation, acoustic analyses were made by using two different computer-supported measuring systems: (1) the "multidimensional voice program" (Kay Elementrics Corp.) and (2) a novel software program developed in Göttingen that includes a new voice quality parameter based on correlations between frequency bands.	0.6305984464520832
Acoustic analyses showed superiority of the glottal versus supraglottal compensatory phonation.	0.3408850063820807
Findings showed that not all acoustic parameters equally documented voice improvement after rehabilitation.	0.34285072066688693
The standard deviation of fundamental frequency was the only parameter showing a significant post-therapeutic improvement.	0.46462414062356394
A further suitable acoustic method proved to be the voice quality parameter that has been newly introduced by us.	0.6027498342748532
In contrast to analogous parameters of other methods, this approach is independent of the exact periodicity of the glottal excitation function, thus permitting reliable results to be obtained even with aphonic or heavily dysphonic voices.	0.62524235656304
Aseptic pseudarthrosis may occur after all kinds of traumatology treatment.	0.3825928611397711
Following conservative treatment, incomplete immobilisation or an unattached bone fragment can be causal.	0.3608644129264192
After plate osteosynthesis the biomechanical principles are not efficient or the circulatory damage delays healing.	0.3867347581061006
There are two broad types of pseudarthrosis: vascular and nonvascular.	0.515638066066965
The extent of vascularisation can be demonstrated by bone scintigraphy as well as X-ray.	0.5965811301878762
The treatment of vascular nonunions is very common.	0.4477508703138102
Mechanical stability is required, therefore a new osteosynthesis is desirable.	0.6353105552910541
Osteoporosis caused by inactivity and dislocation increases the rate of complications.	0.41694071573584207
Much more difficult problems are encountered in treatment of unreactive and avital pseudarthrosis, particularly in cases with a defect of bone substance.	0.7121844231977247
These defects can be treated with a segment transfer and a fibula-to-tibia operation.	0.5964543869349144
Extracorporal lithotripsy has been established as a new method in treatment of active and vascular nonunions.	0.7286324199430605
Former osteosynthesis is not a contraindication.	0.6027309526879844
Stability and immobilisation are necessary.	0.2315324549678297
Treatment in the low-frequency magnetic field shows no effect.	0.6353359849941945
Correct biomechanical and biological osteosynthesis with proper attention paid to location, quality of bone and asepsis can avoid the development of a pseudarthrosis.	0.5737649787743755
Aim of the study: The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence of ophthalmological abnormalities in 10 year old survivors with extremely low birthweight of 500-999 g. In addition the association between retinopathy of prematurity and other ophthalmological disorders was studied.	0.6480343531607864
Background: Although the majority of surgeons regard Hartmann's operation as therapeutic standard in perforations of the colon complicated by peritonitis this procedure has been critically discussed in recent years.	0.6101833082235445
Advocates of one-stage techniques criticized bad postoperative results (high morbidity and mortality) and long-term outcome (low rates of intestinal restoration).	0.7508700306482714
The aim of our study was to investigate whether the late results after Hartmann's operation justify this criticism.	0.6412449637587132
Method: From 1982 to 1997 Hartmann's operations were performed in 103 patients for colonic perforations.	0.5792477107398015
In 63 % of cases inflammatory diseases caused colonic complications.	0.7152614652768977
The average Mannheimer Peritonitis Index (MPI) was 19.	0.5206409995040582
Seventeen patients died postoperatively (mortality: 16.5 %).	0.5514108718028514
In 69 patients (80 %) intestinal restoration could be performed after an average interval of 122 days (complication rate: 6 %, no mortality).	0.6973196655162299
On follow-up, patients were asked to give information on their general state, changes of housing, abdominal complaints, and quality of life.	0.7325817820087013
Results: Data on 93 % of patients could be obtained.	0.8548790518809215
The median follow-up time was 75 months.	0.5437088596932
Eleven patients had died; the remaining 72 were investigated.	0.6368980708823146
86 % described the quality of their lives as good or very good; only 11 % indicated severe loss of activity.	0.5666243309446253
Quality of life did not differ between patients in whom intestinal continuity had been restored and those in whom it had not been restored.	0.6859326325058409
Anastomotic strictures developed in 7 % of cases, always after stapled anastomosis.	0.616065654143705
Conclusions: According to our results, long-term outcome after Hartmann's operation is good.	0.7094138538992469
80 % of patients underwent intestinal restoration with low morbidity (6 %) and no mortality.	0.945001242433095
A great majority of patients indicated the quality of their lives as good or very good: this assessment was not dependent on restoration of intestinal continuity.	0.5295454847107066
Tibial torsion defects are usually not clinically evident and, hence, are often overlooked.	0.6431784497188415
Clinical examination and CT scan have proved to be the best ways of measuring static tibial torsion, whereas dynamic measurements are usually performed in the clinic and the "gait laboratory."	0.6931820516293843
Only few studies have determined there to be a connection between a torsion defect in the lower leg and expected pathological conditions of the knee and ankle joints.	0.8119564002793674
However, patellofemoral instability, Osgood-Schlatter disease, osteochondrosis dissecans are increasingly being found in cases of increased external tibial torsion and arthrosis in reduced torsion.	0.48903655799911055
The aim of this study was to ascertain to what extent homeless, mentally ill subjects in Munich take advantage of available psychosocial services.	0.47829368160017516
To obtain a representative picture of the situation, the first step was to ascertain how many people in Munich are actually homeless.	0.7537362115403328
The next step was to ascertain what proportion of them are in need of psychotherapy.	0.6349310675344243
Using the standardized Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), 146 men and 32 women were interviewed.	0.37779896944677693
The results according to the DSM-III demonstrated high lifelong and 6-month prevalence of psychic disturbances.	0.5499169517455339
Medical and social services were often enjoyed, but mostly over a short period of time in particularly critical situations.	0.5945031340270149
Women were treated more often than men.	0.4110213005426939
Elements such as age and level of education hardly influenced patients' seeking help.	0.4474931740213979
Despite a high prevalence of addictive disease, alcohol and drug clinics were rarely consulted.	0.4274525495804594
The increase in the number of diagnoses was paralleled by an increase in the number of patients seeking help.	0.5490344072304838
Most treatments involved schizophrenia and anxiety.	0.16183484497640208
By means of logistic regression models, predictors of the extent to which these services were used were analysed.	0.5160928012017287
We conclude that new clinical models are needed and that the aversion to the present care system is too great.	0.5503271462831246
Continued treatment occurs only rarely.	0.17007170968445187
Electrocardiographic and clinical characteristics are currently used as diagnostic criteria for the long QT-syndrome.	0.621084462013632
In borderline electrocardiographic findings associated with unclear syncope, it is often difficult to ensure or exclude long QT-syndrome.	0.5782630572585647
Schwartz and coworkers therefore created a point system as a guide in clinical decision making.	0.3204855544912612
In recent years genetic diagnostics have entered the arena of long-QT assessment.	0.4979601363889936
Aside from new insights into the pathophysiology of the long QT-disorder, it is expected that genetic diagnostics will offer substantial help to ascertain long QT-syndrome in patients with borderline electrocardiographic and clinical findings and improve risk stratification in long-QT family members.	0.68793123785298
Performing linkage analysis, coupling of autosomal-dominant congenital long QT-syndrome (Romano-Ward Syndrome) to chromosomes 11 (LQT1/11p15.5), 3 (LQT3/3p21), 7 (LQT2/7q35), and 4 (LQT4/4q25-27) was demonstrated.	0.657037205828373
More recently, the disease genes in long QT-syndrome 1, 2, and 3 could be identified.	0.9186459825010301
Analysis of the base-pair sequence allowed detection of several different mutations in different families illustrating genetic heterogeneity.	0.4565328891933695
Aside from diagnostic aspects, molecular genetics may also guide pharmacological therapy by identifying the specific ion-channel disorder leading to QT-prolongation and sudden death.	0.4019117141366666
During the past 4 years we have demonstrated in eyes with corneal pathology that applanation tonometry (Goldmann, Perkins) generally delivers falsely low measurements in comparison to intraocular needle tonometry.	0.4759460490209136
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether impression tonometry (Schioetz) is more precise than applanation tonometry in determinating the intraocular pressure in eyes with corneal disorders.	0.6450787826827908
The case of a 24-year-old woman with a plunging ranula is reported.	0.6646914700714511
Primarily, the patient noticed extensive swelling of the neck, which had developed 3 months previously.	0.9230110186868797
The polycystic, firmly attached tumor and the sublingual and submandibular glands of the right side of the neck were surgically removed.	0.6245166523120843
Pathological examination showed a retention cyst by means of a plunging ranula.	0.4647328424517425
The etiology, pathogenesis, clinical aspect and diagnostic procedures for the plunging ranula are described.	0.5342605718685194
Various therapeutic possibilities are discussed in regard to their value.	0.6527213037954321
We prefer surgical treatment with a histological examination to verify the diagnosis.	0.680630953647159
The plunging ranula originates on the sublingual gland; therefore, its simultaneous extirpation is recommended to avoid recurrences.	0.4818324365867366
In extensive cases, the additional removal of the submandibular gland can be advised.	0.5372063278937023
Cranial dural fistulae are rare; when they occur, it is usually difficult to detect them at an early stage.	0.6830936281968104
With a view to the question of possible progress in diagnosis we now report on seven patients with lateral dural fistulae fed by branches of the external carotid artery.	0.5454900869277062
The examination was carried out before selective arteriography using cw-Doppler sonography and colour coded duplex sonography in combination.	0.5152604794755331
Sonographic criteria for detection of hyperperfusion take account of flow velocity as well as pulsatility.	0.4336915729174789
In all cases hyperperfusion of the external carotid artery and the common carotid artery was detected.	0.6878826439564018
In most of these cases pathologic findings were also observed at the occipital artery, and more rarely in the contralateral external carotid artery or the ipsilateral vertebral artery, in addition.	0.8224938696000867
A possible source of error arising from confusion of blood vessels was present with the cw-Doppler sonography, but not for colour coded duplex sonography.	0.6670869247038682
Therefore, cranial dural fistulae characterized by a high shunt volume can be diagnosed correctly by indirect Doppler sonographic criteria using cw-Doppler and duplex sonography.	0.5888380303903876
Direct visualization of the fistula and its nidus requires additional selective arteriography, in the course of which endovascular embolization may be performed.	0.649445621411503
Background: Echocardiography is a standard imaging technique for the assessment of heart valve disease.	0.634370966566614
The good spatial and temporal resolution is the basis for different methods which provide information about the severity of such defects.	0.6256202435814419
Dynamic colour visualisation and volumetric measurements of regurgitant jets are a new evaluating tool for the assessment of heart valve insufficiencies.	0.411086178771383
In Germany, as in all industrial nations, there has been an increase in the number of cases of cancer and in cancer-related mortality.	0.843165670044482
According to the German Federal Bureau of Statistics, in 1998 nearly 213,000 persons died due to malignant cancer.	0.6148283235101221
Cancer patients generally have physical and psychological dysfunction that may in turn cause a significant reduction in quality of life if treatment is performed insufficiently or not at all.	0.526823513236769
Pain is the dominant symptom and can have serious effects on the patient and his or her family.	0.7525514528349231
Although various organizations have published treatment plans for adequate pain therapy, in many cases they are not adequately applied by physicians.	0.6459326200350121
This work therefore offers a comprehensive review of pain therapy as an essential component of palliative medicine.	0.5552520407200667
This retrospective study shows the results in 30 patients of revision surgery on their reruptured ACL.	0.6787736564161632
The follow-up time was 30 months on average (range 10 - 54 months).	0.7150111093520125
The follow-up examination included subjective (Lysholm score, Tegner activity level rating score), clinical and radiological criteria and also instrumental laxity testing with the KT-1000 arthrometer.	0.5987358584453422
The overall evaluation was done according to the IKDC score.	0.4270478640999217
The follow up showed subjective and objective results almost equal to those after primary surgery on ACL.	0.5928191445568376
The IKDC score revealed certain abnormal and highly abnormal results, which demonstrated that revision ACL surgery gives poorer results than primary surgery.	0.44321719560396183
Nevertheless, we recommend reconstruction of a torn ACL even in a revision case to restore the knee function and prevent further menisceal and chondral damage and degeneration.	0.6382217782431555
Nowadays, restorative proctocolectomy is considered the "gold standard" in the surgical therapy of ulcerative colitis.	0.7558956792073268
Alternative procedures such as Brooke ileostomy or Kock pouch are limited to special indications.	0.3421725638723448
Preservation of function is the decisive advantage of the ileoanal pouch, but preservation of function is not equal to quality of life.	0.6577904047268122
Quality of life is a multidimensional concept that is difficult to define and measure.	0.5402729676087169
Quality of life can only be assessed by standardized and validated quality-of-life questionnaires.	0.6951933801594428
Preoperatively, patients with ulcerative colitis have a restricted quality of life, depending on the intensity of their disease.	0.5964530107014057
Proctocolectomy is the curative therapy and improves quality of life.	0.41832933682054974
When evaluating quality of life it is not essential if patients are treated by Brooke ileostomy or restorative proctocolectomy.	0.6528043960697891
The advantage of restorative proctocolectomy is the improvement in some aspects such as sexuality and physical acticity.	0.5741159873814892
The "Total Quality-of-Life Index" is not impoved.	0.7351256406895114
Preoperatively, patients should be informed that preservation of function by restorative proctocolectomy is accompanied by an increased postoperative morbidity in comparison to other procedures.	0.7432666114112431
Decreased quality-of-life results when complications occur postoperatively that cannot be controlled over a long period of time.	0.5084592000575826
In some cases excision of the ileoanal pouch may be the most sensible way of solving the problems.	0.6511917577530708
On the other hand, patients without complications and good function after ileoanal pouch procedure may achieve a quality of life comparable to that of healthy controls.	0.5891313173305066
Preoperatively, patients should be aware of this risk-benefit relationship and should share the responsibility of the decision for or against restorative proctocolectomy.	0.5815059462233108
The objective of this investigation was the experimental determination of the contact pressures in the hip joint for characteristic phases of the gait cycle.	0.6233327043656149
The joint forces determined in vivo with telemetric endoprosthesis by Bergmann et al.	0.3399712345175697
(1993) were converted into a pelvic reference system, based on kinematic gait analysis.	0.5394446466813633
In eight cadaveric hip joints (age 18-75 yrs.)	0.4966403437371571
the reaction forces were applied corresponding to four phases of the gait cycle (heel strike, mid-stance, heel off, toe off) and the pressure distribution determined with FUJI pressure sensitive film.	0.5086748927908351
We found maxima of 10 MPa during mid stance.	0.284232542344117
The areas of highest pressure were located in the ventro-superior aspect of the acetabulum (anterior part of the acetabular roof) and in the dorso-inferior aspect of the lunate surface.	0.7697610872495917
The pressure distribution was relatively constant during the four phases and the maxima did not vary proportional to the applied load.	0.43115184313744753
The normal pressure distribution in the hip appears to be determined by the physiological incongruity of the articular surfaces and the inhomogeneous bony support of the acetabulum.	0.7982766207796106
During operative interventions this normal load transfer should be restored as accurately as possible.	0.27152566522745847
In spite of its serious sequelae, volatile substance abuse (VSA) attracts very little public attention in Germany.	0.40101312630963465
Our case report describes an adult male who inhaled propane for recreational purposes.	0.45733653340675506
Initially, he achieved short-lived euphoria and hallucinations.	0.4401919106298504
He compensated for the developing tolerance by increasing the dosage, finally consuming 5 litres of fluid propane daily.	0.39554908570691183
Getting such quantities was facilitated by his occupational access to propane.	0.25754538965258555
Since he abused the propane in an apartment house, he also exposed third parties to the danger of explosion.	0.4319480856210973
Clinical examination revealed disturbances in orientation, restricted perceptivity and concentration, reduced mnemonic performance, and psychomotor agitation.	0.5807728963157717
All these symptoms diminished during a 6-month follow-up.	0.4596715420106463
The relationship of his organic mental disorder to the abuse of propane was not clear, since he had also abused alcohol.	0.5442349867257753
Objectives The Marburg external patellotibial (Mpt) fixator is designed to temporarily protect a reconstructed distal extensor apparatus of the knee.	0.37512842052418555
It allows an early functional aftercare.	0.394237704471057
The indications or ultrasound in the evaluation of pulmonary disorders are described.	0.48739901249466455
Clinical applications are several lung diseases in adults and especially in children.	0.5779245982957578
In specific, well-defined applications, the feasibilties of ultrasound are promising.	0.6526914829499723
Sonography provides important additional information to chest X-ray and is even superior to CT under special circumstances.	0.5666202493508916
Pulmonary sonography is a useful link between conventional X-ray and more expensive cross-sectional imaging.	0.7232865978678185
In the evaluation of pulmonary diseases at present the potential of ultrasound is not optimally used.	0.6712744611088923
Traditionally oral surgeons and dentists have evaluated the jaws using intraoral films and panoramic radiographs.	0.3143299436967204
The involvement of radiologists has been limited.	0.30428939141680944
In the past few years dedicated CT-software-programs developed to evaluate dental implant patients have provided a new look at the jaws.	0.4908496397265375
The complex anatomy is described and identified on human skulls and on axial, panoramic, and cross-sectional images.	0.5671072650317575

An overview of the technique of Dental-CT is provided, furthermore the radiation dose of different organs is explained.	0.6605707605955147
Suggestions to reduce these doses by simple modifications of the recommended procols are given.	0.40039978271902926
The debate on passive and active euthanasia has met a controversial echo both in the German-speaking media and in professional publications within recent years.	0.4934674993835975
This discussion, however, largely excluded mentally ill  patients.	0.3471806212846312
Also, euthanasia advocacy groups have usually distanced themselves from  euthanasia in psychiatric patients.	0.34294112560717704
We report here two cases from our hospital in which in-patients with affective disorders committed assisted suicide during a hospital pass.	0.5748745667759083
We discuss these events under the assumption that these are cases of questionable active euthanasia in mentally ill patients whose judgement was considerably compromised by their disorder.	0.4507897743078225
Definition of the problem: In Germany, the dissection rate of the deceased is distinctly lower than in many other European countries.	0.7585935716301045
Although critics of autopsies use to put forward ethical objections and religious scruples, neither the Christian church nor piety stand opposite to the practise of autopsies.	0.33924632133379673
Currently undergoing a clinical trial a new miniaturized monoplane ultrasound probe potentially enhances the practicability of perioperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) without loss of echocardiographic quality.	0.4267733854547965
Methods: In the present prospective study, the nasally inserted miniaturized TEE probe was tested in 12 ventilated patients and compared with a conventional TEE probe.	0.8772381008603902
Echocardiographic quality was tested by two independent investigators by analyzing the percentage of the endocardium contour detection (<50%, 50-75%, 75-100%) in the left ventricular short- and long-axis views.	0.8505933225538742
Results: In 11 patients, more than 50% of endocardium were visualized continuously with both probes.	0.7565181944891222
Although the nasal TEE probe was inferior to conventional TEE in detecting lateral endocardium, automated endocardium detection compared well with both methods.	0.45197138089340555
Inter- and intraobserver variability in manual measurements of the left ventricular cross-sectional area was below 5% on average and differed non-significantly with regard to the method.	0.7461957096925287
In 2 patients, continuous monitoring was aggravated by repeated loss of contact between the miniaturized TEE probe and mucosa.	0.454089107253161
Conclusions: In comparison with conventional TEE, the miniaturized TEE probe provides practicability advantages without significant loss of information for cardiovascular monitoring.	0.6807448323682107
By means of modern color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) even very small vessels can be visualized.	0.4821783181089796
Maximum resolution nowadays is about 0.5 mm diameter of the vessel.	0.7978243259741611
We compared the use of CCDS and angiography in studying of acral perfusion.	0.46429286854714935
Besides morphologic criteria, hemodynamic criteria were recorded.	0.2892044715735166
Arteries in healthy fingers appear as long and straight vessels with a clearly defined border.	0.3776634646613498
The physiological maximal blood flow velocity exceded 20 cm/s.	0.31443032450851616
CCDS revealed tortuosity of finger arteries as typical finding in thrombangiitis obliterans.	0.26413553095495745
Segmental stenosis can either be identified morphologically or quantified by measurement of the flow velocity with poststenotic maximal systolic velocities of less than 20 cm/s or by the acceleration of the blood flow within the stenosis, as proven by angiographic examinations.	0.5879604401928193
CCDS is suitable for evaluation of acral perfusion in patients suffering from secondary Raynaud's syndrome.	0.41685044926768233
Apart from diagnosis of disturbed acral circulation, other possible applications of CCDS are in in the surgical field, for example replantations in hand or finger surgery.	0.6154923583673501
The discussion of the Osheroff vs Chestnut Lodge court case in the "American Journal of Psychiatry" raised the question whether individual psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is the appropriate treatment for severe depression.	0.5300994067071281
A summary of the crucial points and a review of the clinical and scientific implications of this case is presented.	0.7891013096833064
In addition, the difference between psychiatrists and psychotherapists regarding the assessment of depressive disorders is examined by analysing results of the ICD-10 research criteria study.	0.6214487305364638
In the case of one patient with dysthymia (ICD-10 RC: F34.1) psychotherapists tended more towards a reactive or neurotic etiology than psychiatrists.	0.4712094346718082
By contrast, the percentage of clinicians suspecting an endogenous etiology and thus, diagnosing a psychosis and starting a psychopharmacotherapy was markedly higher among psychiatrists.	0.43843688922461727
In conclusion, the integration of different conceptualizations and treatment modalities is emphasized as an essential task for both psychotherapists and psychiatrists.	0.6227915879739685
For certain patients, an integrated therapy may be more effective.	0.6900575871252417
A 43-year-old patient was admitted for severe claudicatio in his right leg, doppler ultrasound and angiography revealed an occluded right common iliac artery.	0.5733575552406288
Using the cross-over-approach from the contralateral side, it was possible to navigate a guide wire through the occlusion, and after passage with an excimer laser an ipsilateral retrograde puncture with placement of a sheath was performed.	0.632041278301903
In order to protect the the aortoiliac bifurcation, a primary stent implantation of the occluded side was carried out using the kissing balloon technique.	0.6632892490779896
Afterwards three stents were placed.	0.16338290225649074
Subsequently the patient completely improved; treadmill exercise test and duplex sonography showed good results.	0.4052988817338677
Conclusion: Using the kissing balloon technique, laser-assisted recanalisation of iliac artery occlusions even involving the aortoiliac bifurcation compare favorable to other more invasive treatments.	0.5064925873373016
A surgical procedure can thus be avoided.	0.5283275521715808
The typical MRI features of the most common pancreatic diseases, such as pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, have been established.	0.8106077739814928
However, even in these common pancreatic disorders, MRI correlation with the underlying pathology is limited for clinical reasons.	0.7219955847925356
We emphasize MR-pathological correlation of inflammatory and neoplastic pancreatic changes, including pancreatitis, adenocarcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, rare cystic and solid pancreatic neoplasms, and islet cell tumors.	0.566873751944303
By highlighting the correlation of key pathological features with MR findings, a better understanding of the MR appearance of pancreatic pathology can be provided.	0.5548946358953667
In addition, MRI may prove a powerful tool in detection and characterization of pancreatic tumors.	0.5280678411355697
Background: The implantation of a femoro-popliteal bypass graft represents the gold standard in the management of arteriosclerotic occlusive disease in the femoro-popliteal region.	0.6020830888620909
Application of interventional techniques has permitted the development of a novel, endovascular implantable bypass system.	0.4260970881138706
The device is placed within the lumen of the superficial femoral artery.	0.40649115915793477
The present study investigated the technical properties of the new system in cadavers, with subsequent evaluation of its application in humans.	0.8020266577405272
Methods: The endopass consists of a thin-wall polycarbourethane tube with a total length of 53 cm.	0.6728406447758781
The distal end is connected with a self-expanding stent prothesis 4 cm in length.	0.4758245261942526
Endovascular implantation is performed through a groin incision.	0.2881719662942792
Following antegrade ringstripper-TEA, the endopass is introduced into the femoral artery after placement of a guide wire.	0.679244852225036
The proximal anastomosis is performed surgically.	0.27130729171735485
Results: The technical requirements and feasibility of the system were tested on 12 cadaver extremities.	0.7264076934946746
Implantation of the device proved technically successful in seven of eight extremities with significant occlusion of the superficial femoral artery.	0.5518935721104166
The most important problems included the complete ringstripper-TEA, the placement of the guide wire following the TEA, and the expansion of the endopass.	0.7059885514465568
Following approval by the ethics commission, the endopass was implanted in five patients between June 1997 and March 1998.	0.6852723469780136
In three patients, the endopass remained patent and has functioned well.	0.6970863895185542
One patient with poor vascular outflow suffered an early noncorrectable occlusion, while in the remaining case, perforation secondary to the ringstripper procedure forced us to abandon the attempt.	0.6169812068081362
Conclusion: Experience from the cadaver study and initial human applications confirm the feasibility of this method.	0.5272539403336202
Further development and methodological improvement, however, are necessary requiring additional, larger studies on patients.	0.5958023401971696
Introduction: There is no data available on the action of etomidate on ion currents in human neuronal cells.	0.6358598993792084
Therefore the effects of etomidate on a human neuronal delayed rectifer potassium current were investigated.	0.37168265400977907
In order to evaluate patients' exposure to radiation in computed tomography, dose quantities such as the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), multiple scan average dose (MSAD) and dose free in air on the axis of rotation are used.	0.587604635177523
The CTDI and the MSAD, derivable from the CTDI, are a good measure for the absorbed doses in the examined volume, but they do not take the biological sensitivity of the organs into account and do not describe the radiogenic risk that is actually relevant for patients and doctors.	0.6251866730243837
The dose on the axis of rotation is not an accurate measure of the effective dose and the radiogenic risk.	0.5751625607023869
The declaration of a limit for the dose on the axis of rotation should take the different regions into account, in order to guarantee acceptable image quality on one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other side.	0.6340313370711351
As physical dose quantities, the CTDI, MSAD and dose on the axis of rotation are useful to characterize and differentiate between programs and systems concerning radiation exposure.	0.4322138332587671
Prognosis of patients surviving acute myocardial infarction has substantially improved over the last two decades.	0.6453061310592028
However, stratification of patients at risk for death due to arrhythmic events remains a clinical challenge.	0.614190684043446
Due to the important role of the autonomic nervous system in the genesis of sudden death, autonomic markers such as heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity have recently gained attention as risk stratification parameters.	0.6516932623406315
The present study reports the results of noninvasive risk stratification in 411 consecutive postinfarction patients treated due to contemporary therapeutical guidelines with a high proportion of patients discharged with a patent infarct related artery.	0.5992266772971052
The diagnostic arsenal of risk parameters comprised heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and more traditional markers such as non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ventricular late potentials.	0.5781790123791137
Patiens were followed for a mean of 33  +/- 21 months.	0.6646025409836421
Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that left ventricular function, both autonomic markers, and the patency of the infarct related artery were independent predictors of the prospectively defined primary study endpoint, i.e., all-cause mortality plus ventricular tachyarrhythmic events.	0.6278016184351615
With respect to the secondary endpoint (ventricular tachyarrhythmic events), left ventricular function, heart rate variability, and infarct vessel patency were independent predictors.	0.6678184298707136
Ventricular late potentials and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia had no predictive value with respect to ventricular tachyarrhythmic events.	0.4302705498038818
These findings from a large prospective long-term study demonstrate the value of markers of cardiac autonomic tone in identifying infarct survivors at risk for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death.	0.5042651127055255
K+ Channels and Cardiotoxicity of Drugs: Implications for Drug Toxicity Assessment - The time required for repolarization of the ventricles can be measured as the QT interval of the ECG and is determined primarily by activation of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK), which consists of a rapid component (IKr) and a slow component (IKs).	0.6811349468891137
Drugs that block cardiac IKr prolong the cardiac action potential (AP).	0.2866045146932586
Prolonged repolarization is detected as a longer QT interval on the ECG.	0.3199509234373356
During prolonged APs, increased inward currents induce early afterdepolarizations, which increase the risk of Torsades de pointes (TdP) cardiac arrhythmias.	0.4913075103170598
TdP arrhythmia is characterized by an apparent twisting of the electrical axis around the isoelectric line.	0.38871536469498075
It has a rate of 150 to 250 beats/min and it can occasionally degenerate into ventricular fibrillation that may be fatal.	0.6046528204786045
The incidence of drug-induced TdP arrhythmias is highest among class IA and class III antiarrhythmic agents.	0.47799926960676603
However, under certain clinical conditions, also several non-cardiovascular medicinal products induce QT interval prolongations in the ECG or TdP arrhythmias.	0.5350776026841417
Since all drugs known to cause TdP block IKr, an early evaluation of possible effects on APs of cardiac myocytes expressing IKr channels during the developmental phases of novel drugs seems to be recommended.	0.560271511605246
If in-vitro electrophysiological studies show the new active substance to induce AP prolongation and/or K+ channel blockade in appropriate models and at relevant concentrations,  either further development of the new active substance may not be justified or the risk factors predisposing to TdP arrhythmias should be taken into account in further clinical studies.	0.649408255281553
Carcinoma of the penis is a malignant epithelial tumor of ominous prognosis if not adequately treated.	0.5237065672562494
To a large extent the probability of positive lymph nodes is determined by the grade of the primary lesion.	0.7659631689711269
In turn the number of positive nodes greatly influences the survival.	0.34854651093032807
In the past the complications of radical ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy have decreased their timely indication.	0.513845672335233
If delayed lymphadenectomy is performed, the survival rate is reduced by approximately 50 % as compared to the results of immediate lymphadenectomy.	0.7876777066976274
The modified inguinal lymphadenectomy described by Catalona leads to less complications.	0.27709632147206215
If performed without delay it should lead to improved survival in patients with higher stage and high grade penile cancer.	0.5447443889717345
Recently suggested employment of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherpy may further enhance the survival.	0.2879594447215029
On the basis of existing models for psychodynamic diagnostic evaluation and psychoanalytic interview technique and of the theoretical concepts of the 5 axes of the OPD diagnosis, a new type of the psychodynamic assessment interview is presented.	0.6501327475850752
The examination is structured in 5 phases: the opening scene, exploration of specific examples for relationships, exploration of experience of self and others, of therapy motivation, and finally clarifying the preconditions for treatment and the ability for insight.	0.6717277734672614
The syndrome diagnosis according to ICD 10 is completed in a final phase.	0.4002230313665888
This psychodynamic-diagnostic assessment interview is recommended, apart from the use for OPD diagnosis, for use a clinical instrument.	0.5607737818426496
