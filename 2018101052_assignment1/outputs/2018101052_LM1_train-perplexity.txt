Resumption of the session	0.13474910339249976
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.	1.1098826909535608
Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.	1.36242229466077
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.	1.201525429931819
In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute' s silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.	1.5137233725302137
Please rise, then, for this minute' s silence.	1.3027041217085145
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)	0.3436815902905627
Madam President, on a point of order.	0.937014339380419
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka.	1.043014725972649
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago.	1.3968436331753118
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?	1.2315505435719711
Yes, Mr Evans, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.	1.603146770830551
If the House agrees, I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested.	1.2757369836918393
Madam President, on a point of order.	0.937014339380419
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility.	1.122275914640374
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.	1.1912772855311569
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.	1.0321436706750864
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.	1.0848401830392411
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.	1.3421072713756277
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report, not a legislative proposal, and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday.	1.5223958443264547
That is precisely the time when you may, if you wish, raise this question, i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.	1.2723729171717504
Madam President, coinciding with this year' s first part-session of the European Parliament, a date has been set, unfortunately for next Thursday, in Texas in America, for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death. We shall call him Mr Hicks.	1.421496776635496
At the request of a French Member, Mr Zimeray, a petition has already been presented, which many people signed, including myself.	1.58584032568809
However, I would ask you, in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community, to make representations, using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent, to the President and to the Governor of Texas, Mr Bush, who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.	1.473274260697696
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.	1.5169135879631184
Thank you, Mr Segni, I shall do so gladly.	1.388913509261545
Indeed, it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.	1.4168693084374966
Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest.	1.3006448866934608
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.	1.463886088572182
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia, too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right.	1.0672359744104813
Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.	1.4522500058339605
We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.	1.3440289663862899
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament's position, as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted, clear as far as Russia is concerned.	1.3786382380475202
Yes, Mrs Schroedter, I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter.	1.45607243388886
Madam President, I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that, during this first part-session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.	1.3288349578891305
But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met.	1.2893393791461658
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one, there is still no Dutch channel, which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.	1.2401321948965154
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.	1.4435065925875223
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors' meeting on Wednesday.	1.151587123404617
It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.	1.32842830433527
Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?	1.2942923719154669
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected?	0.9593668432293323
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998?	0.8303478074649759
Why has there been no fire drill, either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?	0.8928158069750142
Why are there no fire instructions?	0.6594187575712664
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?	0.7245739592884952
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?	0.7184229661133561
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.	0.8315651700939822
Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.	1.3425125638624202
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors, and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.	1.3238277965147855
Madam President, Mrs Díez González and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, which appeared in a Spanish newspaper.	1.3772578822650772
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session.	1.1731197822935246
I would ask that they reconsider, since this is not the case.	1.2940577411971184
The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio' s intervention, on another occasion, and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.	1.1667518790132871
Mr Berenguer Fuster, we shall check all this.	1.2962629287574001
I admit that, at present, the matter seems to be somewhat confused.	1.4376148676989262
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.	1.1755752417330267
Madam President, I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past?	1.2775176333822396
Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.	1.0473900301460985
So Parliament should send a message, since that is the wish of the vast majority.	1.2223231175138745
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.	0.9512826702432343
As people have said, the situation there is extremely volatile.	1.3907569938472026
There is, in fact, a risk of a military coup in the future.	1.215007948337662
We do not know what is happening.	1.0309566513686523
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people?	0.8698854436867839
In any event, this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday.	1.1089588592606427
Agenda	-0.0
The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	0.9014174469460215
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday.	0.8530834125686071
Relating to Wednesday:	0.08040367369436964
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission.	1.0332255107985109
I would like Mr Barón Crespo, who made the request, to speak to propose it. That is, if he so wishes, of course.	1.5741092393660239
Then we shall follow the usual procedure, hearing one speaker in favour and one against.	0.7238927944304102
Madam President, the presentation of the Prodi Commission' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.	1.2975680171013662
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, basically dictates this Parliament' s political and legislative activity for the next five years.	1.3336632190257238
I would also like to point out, Madam President, that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature. It did so again during this legislature, in July, and then, in September, it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.	1.5343524741999013
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.	1.2577037769672732
To this end, I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.	1.2224452267078454
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents, that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma. Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme, in which case it should clarify it.	1.3299649027971585
According to its President, it is in a position to do so.	1.3395938705782922
Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio, I believe that, before voting, it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme, as agreed. Alternatively, Parliament is not ready to examine this programme, as some appear to be suggesting.	1.5422730834939173
In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.	1.4326509483227137
My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen, debate and reflect, there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is ready to do so, we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.	1.283854626287811
Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and which you have mentioned, is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday, including its proposed administrative reform, because, otherwise, we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: on the pretext that there is no text, on the one hand, the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.	1.4656858079923631
Therefore, Madam President, I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.	1.280154191814172
(Applause from the PSE Group)	0.26895271987047414
Madam President, I would like to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, amongst those, the decision establishing its agenda.	1.4118029884316572
We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide.	0.6265533247410399
But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr Barón Crespo has reminded us, which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission' s legislative programme, on the broad areas of action for the next five years, that is to say, for this legislature.	1.4595329277595128
Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission' s legislative programme.	1.2456328498963811
I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally, on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.	1.3794260678289691
Therefore, Madam President, I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for 2000, which is what we fully agreed upon.	1.5200519276710538
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.	1.1882156049958648
(Parliament rejected the request) President.	0.7397191183042122
Still on the subject of Wednesday' s sitting, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.	1.230639170093785
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.	0.6381990494004859
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this?	0.8836610460035956
Madam President, I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists. I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.	1.282443168545081
I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already.	1.3662445410541568
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.	0.9915831684131068
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.	0.9001431881733616
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	0.9021209512086343
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request.	0.9647069856868292
Madam President, I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering' s lack of logic.	1.0089443773339966
He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents, and now he is doing just the same.	1.134829341959397
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups. As my fellow chairmen will recall, I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it.	1.4558360331586695
It is not a lot to ask.	1.307469252240725
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.	1.379885708141778
We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.	0.9884536882861429
(Parliament rejected the request, with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions)	0.9836549946827455
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate.	0.980886629989437
Thank you very much.	0.6600835891524878
Madam President, has my vote been counted? I was unable to vote electronically, since I do not have a card.	1.5381974825363078
My vote was "in favour" .	0.926434026580059
Indeed, if we add the two Members who have declared themselves, then the result of the vote would be ....	1.4751050952604319
Madam President, the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote.	1.521026872811278
There is no room for amendments.	0.9486950366210541
Madam President, in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.	1.6319792169599872
That did not happen.	0.4761812554057627
I would appreciate it if, on the close of this item of business, I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group.	1.3186077592159688
This is an important matter.	1.1386594476666156
It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.	1.5045821159410946
Madam President, I do not wish to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Barón Crespo's motion.	1.2964606086240005
You did not call me either.	0.6474131772933135
I regret this, but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.	1.5240253760233928
I am terribly sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox. I did not see you asking to speak.	1.311309610771991
Even so, I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes.	1.3364139150354282
When we adopt the Minutes for today' s sitting tomorrow, then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.	1.254417699090093
This seems to me to be a workable solution.	1.1303434723135495
Of course, the Minutes for tomorrow' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.	1.313902868536935
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes.	1.0972832481024777
Mr Cox, Mr Hänsch, would this be acceptable to you?	1.4580508056338537
Madam President, if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not, and cannot, object to that.	1.3914640238398528
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations.	1.2518929215114576
We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes, as we always do, of course.	1.4426779512178312
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted, then we may correct them, if necessary.	1.2153687285237307
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)	0.8804098977112303
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods	0.10600640477239227
The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).	0.8006677946736833
Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	0.9752113911687292
Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.	1.2991569869707214
Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.	1.1849799573867172
Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.	1.5161114845110129
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.	1.4254157600677595
Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily.	1.36927325166878
They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.	1.223330991239063
The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support.	1.539302748987951
By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.	1.2800794456772098
I would urge you to endorse this.	0.7284465612942128
Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.	1.4150567906975628
As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.	1.3801083636085247
The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.	1.051819221963126
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.	1.2229508466157415
In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.	1.1321710053881395
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.	1.2928234935559946
All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.	1.2258237224662367
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.	1.4397860341602913
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.	0.8786310954619112
I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.	1.4046974609228393
In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.	1.4329361463232144
Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.	1.4692818558374785
The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.	0.9247365518273178
I congratulate him on his excellent report.	0.8843582701563839
Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.	1.1893543357525254
The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained.	1.392588809289419
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.	1.242120135447578
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.	1.1169762146175568
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.	1.2022728944942054
Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.	0.8976822575645745
I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.	1.4428648355432638
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.	1.2455558794772599
This is a pity, in a sense.	1.8186645621143747
Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.	1.2814351073596943
This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.	1.302376596346377
Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead.	1.2140786305459677
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.	0.9529139150284335
Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.	1.2737218341485823
In short, the issue is an important one.	1.481859179979615
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.	1.2415992436215686
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.	1.29211764217694
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems.	1.0326206558029407
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.	1.0378365810471892
The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement.	1.2757231488166598
I would like to mention one final point.	1.2378630721241153
With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time.	1.1899400728960128
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.	0.788527778713463
This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.	1.3018953063218044
Madam President, the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.	1.2781240158668419
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.	1.101128931013561
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.	0.8976069624108438
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.	1.046624559047903
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.	1.2760762867371882
This, however, does not seem feasible.	1.2468783198781237
Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support.	1.4139753480027761
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which, though technical, are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.	1.2989496811981418
I should like to make just a few comments.	1.2632425738753335
Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.	1.3496846056060405
Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long.	1.4226465344537076
This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.	1.5123390286423977
My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards.	1.3707408564233776
In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.	1.2900057636142788
However, when it comes to safety, I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria.	1.492038297188632
I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.	1.2633103939110124
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.	1.1793301035375512
My third point has also been mentioned already.	0.8828143147087637
As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role.	1.4205240725559303
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.	1.2121518646061449
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.	1.3958764903133603
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	1.1568191498687532
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.	1.5249167101021526
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.	1.4840395541451101
Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport.	1.2489264301683347
As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.	1.180909178335791
The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.	1.026145338205182
In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.	1.3837957885509529
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.	1.1418659525561112
Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.	1.1366643190053287
Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.	1.3057246113007304
Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.	1.2087291442715073
This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.	1.430202162927425
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.	1.1561023702731656
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.	1.4204031604396639
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.	1.3590379333543343
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.1800861409464389
Transport of dangerous goods by road	0.13932033176622957
The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)].	0.7514075906195301
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation.	1.0703039550640754
Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.	1.2491937488083154
In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.	1.1221908756830816
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.	1.4001491531988723
In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.	1.2826083165839106
Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.	1.4684296344026713
The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.	0.9588499654400551
It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.	1.1544061691927519
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers.	1.2801966035893892
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own. In so doing, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.	1.327083500131931
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.	1.193067694853073
The proposal to be discussed today, to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, dates from May 1999, however, and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.	1.2322318537309103
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.	1.1904065850970347
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months.	1.512004376150603
In addition, the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.	1.2234821672802059
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements, in particular for vacuum tanks, if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20ºC. This is in the special interest of northern European regions.	1.4224889356632018
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.	1.260996419919965
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety, but I would ask you to endorse this report.	1.3281448457978102
Mr President, colleagues, a happy new year and millennium to you all.	1.376650717746362
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session, so this is quite exciting for me, a little like first love, although that did last longer than two minutes.	1.475779850831224
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.	1.1726914789279368
It is good that this directive should be established now, as, otherwise, Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time, a period of transition, which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy.	1.4673793117486735
The Commission' s proposal, however, does not take account of all the facts, such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.	1.2460207276941728
Consequently, I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch' s intrinsically excellent report, which have been adopted by our committee.	1.3436520089425683
My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.	0.7490171787667218
According to the Commission' s proposal -20ºC would have been sufficient. On the shores of the Mediterranean, it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.	1.3086471039366245
There is support for the EU in Lapland also, so let us remember them.	1.3855978130905768
I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40ºC.	0.8107290490903478
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.	1.1620287224661334
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow' s vote.	1.0203235004646578
Mr President, with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.	1.2205212882650887
I thought that it was quite superb.	1.017290849747937
On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe's roads, railways, and so on are as safe as possible.	1.5684905282295158
This directive is a contribution to this.	1.0002509383474267
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.	1.1191580981556701
The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.	1.2915459327439391
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that, in 2001, we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.	1.5158103709923307
Mr President, the report we are discussing here does not, in itself, entail any major changes.	1.4390101914539084
Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.	1.0242476426206624
It is nonetheless worth emphasising that, each time we make this type of decision, it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.	1.2917275437271802
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU, both on roads and railways and by sea.	1.2129618683001004
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.	0.8759953404738524
In area after area, we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States.	1.164557397701071
This is extraordinarily positive, and there is cause to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for the work he has put in on this issue.	1.354313938351666
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.	1.3599010345167248
If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running, it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also, as far as possible, apply to every country.	1.3103562394308852
I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance, namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament, Mr Ari Vatanen.	1.4350092861075412
In many ways, the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another.	1.0105536557690993
By approving this amendment, we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union.	1.4251881864311278
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.	0.806708223387846
It is good that, in establishing the present regulations, we can also be flexible.	1.5840085510996353
I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment.	1.0825399737448413
Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.	1.4162966963665706
The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously.	1.174342569337171
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations, and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts, in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.	1.4192129018939912
For one thing is clear: even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union, traffic does not stop at our borders, it goes beyond them.	1.3880524506322534
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions.	0.9159177110753127
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at?	1.1763592887935395
Mr President, I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report, which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport.	1.2880974384010215
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able, in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union.	1.3985481171026004
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours.	1.090329060804193
A moment ago, Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures, not of 20 degrees below zero, but of 40 degrees below zero.	1.3918535652365491
Of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.	1.3521790573898023
I would like to say, with regard to Mr Swoboda' s comments on the activity of the CEN, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.	1.3976138240109963
Lastly, Mr President, the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out. We have referred to the delay by the CEN, the amendment of certain provisions, the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.	1.4800465544268224
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which are contained in the various amendments, specifically four.	1.5338046721321106
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.	0.9749668971657764
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.1800861409464389
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination	0.7110028761237722
The next item is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 [COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)].	0.7956008290020489
Mr President, it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament, namely Wales.	1.6229537132398346
A major part of Wales, as you know, has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme.	1.2584219593065242
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face.	1.2118750721588003
We have seen poverty growing in Wales; and growing still further since 1997.	1.0803637266160717
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.	0.9774814311969092
We are looking, therefore, within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality.	1.5383864259514266
What is, however, deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been, in a sense, a success of the government. It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces.	1.4774291904416759
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront.	1.665814335294612
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.	1.305643121899222
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures.	1.13501807537156
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.	1.3409859636117079
We look to it to challenge the UK Government, to ensure that the private sector, which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure, is involved in the planning stage.	1.4175231613718184
Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.	1.4235911712473628
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent.	1.3619511517894125
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales.	1.768160041629723
Mr President, our committee views these issues very differently and, to start, I will speak from the point of view of research.	1.6465749635101163
We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee' s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.	1.2874502966060601
This will be possible with action on the part of governments, and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.	1.3441873264269233
Another matter we would like to address, specifically from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services, electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet, when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds.	1.4787729457758494
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.	0.7645792115890768
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry, but today those areas might have become a burden, and they may well be poor, meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production, as I might call it, and the production of services, because they are the industries of the future.	1.406027047459152
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would draw the Commission' s attention to this issue.	1.3908527393099364
Finally, as the committee representing energy, we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more, thus, through a process of coordination, increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.	1.3695656799283173
Mr President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague, Mrs Flautre, who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill.	1.373838192708856
I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	1.0834329225245822
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.	1.0588594555978588
In the past, this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.	1.3089093511463756
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.	1.1102396764199056
We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.	1.123405605389795
In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking, yet desperately needed.	1.1552073515601728
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.	1.3015567242493589
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted, as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme.	1.2954950323919947
It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance, which is subject to review after three and a half years, and the Member States' annual national plans for employment.	1.4475373791860653
We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.	1.4127251992594618
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal presented by the Commission, in accordance with its mandate, is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	1.326980010011801
I would like to point out, however, that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us: maintaining a population in rural areas, given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.	1.1386471263571587
This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.	1.1489272251914697
The consequences do not inspire hope.	0.6234871786928521
It is the young people who are disappearing, who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas, all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.	1.3328705524791218
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.	1.0848795589372318
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union.	0.8662027145344879
Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union.	0.9861979625334872
Furthermore, three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes.	1.1566397583939714
For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc. However, even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it is still essential, not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.	1.398082614001661
Therefore, we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set. We want rural areas, at the dawn of the 21st century, to be competitive and multi-functional, both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.	1.470273772433707
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium, and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues, which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17.	1.404138424200969
In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that, for the European Union, maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.	1.3597435656384047
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter, the rapporteur, for her work.	1.2372480555547052
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well.	1.0338678582498264
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.	1.441524025593331
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air.	1.455867526158312
The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament, particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.	1.5654095344594394
In our amendments, we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their application should be reflected, in the best and most profitable way, by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are, when all is said and done, the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.	1.4758264516252357
In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives, we think that those who generate employment, the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment, that is, businesspeople, must participate in this initiative.	1.3330017136012557
Small and medium-sized businesses, above all, need to take part in the distribution of these funds.	0.8885562952694722
If they do not, if businesspeople feel marginalised, if entrepreneurs cannot take part, not only in managing but also in receiving these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.	1.3968749194546706
Also, in order to attain our objectives, to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment, it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies, to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.	1.3036716591712318
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business, which, by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations, but complementing them, never obstructing or excluding them, will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.	1.4365044413559054
Mr President, it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague, Mr Evans, of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status.	1.4684654065638125
It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party.	0.9031478432051421
Let me also remind him that when his party leader, Mr Hague, was Secretary of State for Wales, he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements.	1.2175629235762166
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality.	0.9787589058827484
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation.	0.739649436577712
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.	0.9311152726861556
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.	1.263758594171696
The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration, to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine.	1.3177571426244754
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector.	1.0646164690476976
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future.	1.0891094953885843
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.	1.203018832433058
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.	0.8393017625065659
They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development, resulting in inevitable delays and underspends, particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.	1.0898627383491857
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer, either in the Commission or in the civil service.	1.3383053286048112
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate, while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes.	1.2854162696294227
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad, indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.	1.1711518096796827
If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence, which will be the key to future success.	1.1307037385200562
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines: whether EU regional policy with a good, solid, enabling guideline, can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU.	1.2123666411716811
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report. She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report.	1.2913479645430965
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.	1.0228483587861534
We are badly behind now in this matter.	0.6411735342804514
Hopefully, the stands Parliament has taken will help, however, in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation.	1.3373139383703494
For the time, the report grew too large when it was being debated.	1.4298291914269106
It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports.	0.8948243248255906
At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy, bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.	1.1847339866056408
Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes.	1.1435512414569966
It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes.	0.7658061320273645
Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas.	0.8255150796106041
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.	1.1335218900434791
Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes.	1.0160470883845916
Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned.	1.1404970764402822
Projects have to be carried out more efficiently, more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.	1.468023996834291
While the report was being prepared, it was interesting to discuss the Union' s regional policy in general.	1.3982609020537682
For us new members, it was the first time, and this was a very interesting process.	1.6253935475918806
This report is very good and our Group supports it.	1.1778007127018355
Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission' s offices for several months.	1.2456259287096187
Bearing this in mind, this House should, in any event, demand that, before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved, they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament, specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today.	1.622327787279447
This is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fairer Europe.	1.2198865904360896
Mr President, we should not forget that the main, strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.	1.4298456050009614
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.	0.9186287427982633
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.	1.413812945173694
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.	1.148209700576448
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator.	0.8536042772568655
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population.	1.0244589024381245
We will have to study several indicators, which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others, and how they are evolving.	1.3530940858105005
It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament' s plenary sitting today that Europe' s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions.	1.1555028337137476
This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically.	1.4909474282792288
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity, as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives.	1.805395764141304
I do not think, however, that this report has come too late.	1.5496390838683238
We need to consider it together, so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development, which have been drafted before the directives come into force, can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.	1.3510508137306958
We all agree that we should ask that, halfway through these programmes, when the assessment of the directives is made, Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens' representatives.	1.4908194628638944
Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is, at least on the face of it, bureaucratic.	1.4951479960440335
They need to see the political dimension working, to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.	1.3930770629400102
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for.	1.2563083789903733
I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.	1.7866111992391127
Mr President, I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following: there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.	1.2993324669741158
This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.	1.2887224116472826
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.	0.8400274330707311
This latter point is of particular importance.	0.7677888490253444
While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers.	1.0815701564644968
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.	1.1363401005239278
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries, mainly through the upgrading of roads, water treatment and related transport networks.	1.2013670565667764
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year, which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session.	1.2595757242019046
Key EU programmes between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe.	1.0770293304079446
The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date. This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions, the poorer regions in Europe, are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone, as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital exist.	1.2651881861977665
In conclusion, while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society.	1.3871381346838445
The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions, financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment, assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy.	0.9514671518044775
Mr President, on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues. This time, however, I actually agree with her.	1.553300379535866
Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path, I cannot say. Nevertheless, I would like to commend her on her work.	1.3083399806462894
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex, as we and Mrs McCarthy, as rapporteurs for the general regulation, had asked.	1.5057636605573281
Unfortunately, this did not happen. Mr Bernié is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee.	1.5259495342593599
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament' s position.	1.0661110119039892
Thirdly, we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far.	1.312770321234906
They are particularly beneficial to the Member States, and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development, job creation and, more particularly, on equal opportunities and transport issues.	1.3768214574245454
Personally, I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines.	1.4181948672249092
As an islander, however, I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development.	0.9420760299787915
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again.	1.5767079786208946
Commissioner, we shall continue to raise the issue, as Article 158, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands.	1.6788620327445118
Therefore, the Commission should address the issue once and for all.	1.47345131476768
The time has come to implement the programmes, and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.	1.3043605562485592
As for us in Parliament, I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May.	1.2917046185534824
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.	1.1625040608068569
Mr President, Commissioner, in this minute and a half I should like, first of all, to congratulate Mrs Schroedter.	1.4968481717992346
I know many have already done so, but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides, and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.	1.2926887203508808
I share the regrets she expressed, namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines, since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect, which in my view is a pity.	1.3746967376785575
Consequently, I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003, and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003.	1.4070915674429059
In brief, I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006, which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face.	1.2298303514417779
The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies.	1.2336351940202277
Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking.	1.176387161327409
We must ask ourselves a fundamental question: how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development?	0.9912851791145993
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will, of course, have a considerable impact, both in budgetary and geographical terms.	1.2888813028187012
These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us.	1.550316258374846
Finally, in this time of natural disasters, I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds.	1.482123612508706
As you know, it is up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation.	1.3248874727778723
Europe should not be completely absent, as the states tend to want.	1.2209114592564942
Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response, even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations.	1.1702806600247855
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.	1.0471257132952891
I also think we should ensure, or ask Member States to ensure, that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.	1.3619874363863131
Mr President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.	1.1367963826986567
As far as French planning experts are concerned, for example, the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country.	1.194205484073956
Well, the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process.	1.366789225998204
Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator.	0.950595230726466
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds.	0.9401192412411239
What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax, which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level.	1.378823740473726
The Commission, however, though bound to issue guidelines, does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner.	1.4067421898091146
The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere.	1.0103311811164324
It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.	0.9828577014223774
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.	0.9559083347015839
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.	0.9769274749467272
Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.	1.2221405291147251
To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds.	1.381038859739277
For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.	1.467537205006461
For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.	1.1154411380834512
There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission' s attention. Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided.	1.2725868384264132
Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds. This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain.	1.425094412254147
I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern.	1.404721112145156
Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular.	1.6173338864422615
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.	1.3771343576197055
The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.	1.2238292552436296
That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.	1.3981112381416083
I would like to explain our thinking here.	1.2149505085062593
Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.	1.4405989486473287
Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as "value for money" indicators in the grant-giving process.	1.3237536087221653
Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.	1.2008231369788027
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.	1.1809662118262723
Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.	1.1074484921327832
Finally, we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.	1.4226416625891383
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.	1.0796116039809591
Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see.	1.228412098947906
That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.	1.2181337927860694
If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a "hand-up".	1.5292056287456297
I urge the House to support these changes.	1.364917104219768
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.	1.2337114173500316
The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions.	1.3350865198836994
Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.	1.3191648133289466
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines.	1.1311058465889234
Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life.	1.1127956215195767
Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland.	1.2832259932111199
In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best.	1.4226537117612632
Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that.	1.3757150830643152
However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy.	1.4856019719089364
Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it.	1.2420054997142345
The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South.	1.3073204492209218
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States.	0.8661424665189453
If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.	1.4110395849185697
Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.	1.346019431299043
The Union' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.	1.5068380989484338
A large section of the Union' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots.	1.143545341337914
Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.	1.4523525627582192
Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union.	1.2722144680781104
The first is the fundamental, central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.	1.2193455809940752
We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously.	1.3666140098705113
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union' s fundamental objectives.	1.3755692837949494
Secondly, I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.	1.563669083113237
In future, we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as, in my country, the islands of the Azores and Madeira.	1.3488729738887535
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament?	1.3214332666743542
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.	1.268985710980348
Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.	1.2021320439462972
However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.	1.370736078772397
Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.	1.4254298665582845
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.	1.2532923298061305
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.	1.3317972283232413
I should be very grateful, Mrs Schroedter, if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.	1.2413372723628866
Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.	1.2849654351584925
Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion, despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how, in fact, these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe' s most highly-developed regions.	1.390148104703504
They are growing, but only in terms of GDP.	1.2948819465126977
They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.	1.2946464704607354
Commissioner, please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority, because this is our citizens' greatest problem.	1.3193306423159554
Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require.	1.6769020906950478
Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.	1.413993055760778
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty.	1.2678743251210634
Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.	1.0212001652244684
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments, occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter' s report.	1.0781058185957606
Everyone understands, Mrs Schroedter, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time limits involved - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays, since we are discussing this report right now, as the representative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.	1.5842346688242894
Mrs Schroedter, you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters, European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires, and is the justification for, a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.	1.4400421396690175
So, ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you, Mrs Schroedter, and the various Members of this House, have made.	1.379331296496847
Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1, 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds.	1.208829396985163
This means putting forward the Commission' s priorities, based on past experience in implementing the programmes, as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations.	1.1008001824790767
The objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use, to the optimum and efficient use, as some of you have wished, of Community involvement, including, Mr Bradbourn, using, if necessary, the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies.	1.4449057740760098
When I speak of optimum utilisation, I am referring both to the national and regional levels.	1.4381424236512295
And so, Mr Seppänen, I shall also mention at this point, speaking of the national level, the link with the Cohesion Fund.	1.5260850673164088
This is the purpose of these guidelines.	1.1585442286104992
Regarding their content, as you know, ladies and gentlemen of this House, they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but, at the same time, very passionately, as I understood her presentation just now.	1.2623360740636547
The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create, in all sectors, but especially in the private sector, as Mr Berend said, the maximum number of serious, worthwhile and permanent jobs, the competitiveness of regional economies, all regional economies, and in particular, Mr Evans, that of Wales, but not only of Wales.	1.6467920608319038
And, because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission, let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handicapped by their distance from the centre, be they remote regions, island regions or, of course, the most remote regions which are, naturally, the most distant.	1.4418611166827644
Perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro, who asked me about this, that, as I wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions, the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report.	1.3289462943041732
Concerning the most remote regions, it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments, but this is not necessarily an excuse, just an explanation.	1.406988685099468
We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work.	1.0499972355304976
I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and, within the College, we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions. I would thank you for your understanding in this matter.	1.361193685082707
So that is the first priority, the competitiveness of regional economies.	1.4628477772036312
The second priority, which several of you have stressed, Mr Puerta in particular, but there were others, not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority, is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment, particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past.	1.5825318266587163
Ladies and gentlemen, we now have a European Union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great, proving the effectiveness and worth of the Cohesion Fund, but where, at the same time, in relation to unemployment - as you wrote, Mrs Schroedter - an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions. This is a situation which is, as it should be, unjustifiable and intolerable.	1.416574761576942
As far as I am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention, as far as possible, with your support, of dedicating all the appropriations for which I am responsible to this improved social, human and territorial cohesion, particularly in order to prevent what I once called in this House a two-speed Europe, a Europe of wealthy districts but, at the same time, a Europe of impoverished areas.	1.4748748899182111
The third objective is urban and rural development, within the scope of a balanced territorial policy.	0.9437939323565903
In fact, the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account. The first is rural development, and let me say, Mrs Schroedter, that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport, an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time.	1.5629157388823551
I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country. The second principle is that of equal opportunities, particularly for men and women, as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union.	1.5431250243036372
Finally, and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this House, particularly yourself, Mrs Schroedter, in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies, for development or redevelopment, which, of all the priorities, offer the maximum opportunity to synergy, to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership. You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership, yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines.	1.525478609979216
However, I do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that, as far as I am concerned, this partnership - and I spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - is a tool, one used to involve local brainpower, be it in the public sector, in the form of elected representatives, the social and educational sectors, associations, or in the private sector; a decentralised partnership, and let me mention in this connection, in response to Mrs Angelilli, the territorial pacts, which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership.	1.571851392011252
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities, since they must be taken into consideration, under each of the objectives, to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions.	1.4309931803883575
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made, ladies and gentlemen, and firstly on procedure.	1.2634309222896862
It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date.	1.0791532532062602
Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a draft in February 1999, in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text, my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, presented them to Parliament immediately.	1.3230632552523818
Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999.	1.4176672162542132
Here in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned, your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.	1.5778964249523368
And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account.	1.493814454602967
Now to the form. On the subject of the role of the guidelines, Mrs Schroedter, you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives, often very precise ones, should be provided.	1.3508789527195182
I shall not list them all, but they include implementing intersectoral policies, increasing efficiency in the use of public funds, assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together, etc. The Commission takes note of these, but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents, such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document.	1.296131476251782
Drawing to a close, I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated, Mrs Schroedter.	1.1620309850785677
I am thinking, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations.	1.4660529409909249
This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring' s negotiations.	1.1231976706958164
The Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations, which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad, indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies.	1.2296664012283143
I actually quoted the text itself, in quotation marks.	1.1607242994931701
Moreover, the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes.	1.15577977664278
You then mentioned, Mrs Schroedter, the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development, pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.	1.1250434900050905
I find the opposite the case.	0.8236252175853152
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches, and shall attach, to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.	1.4936739552633056
Indeed, I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere.	1.4556577759888716
As regards rural development, which a number of you brought up, particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez, the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur: a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas, but also protection of the environment and Europe' s rural heritage.	1.4016693263430877
It must, however, be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds, whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority.	1.2236022538163658
And indeed, on the subject of the balance of rural society, let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.	1.1998540979633152
At this stage, I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas, in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions.	1.333400005167396
In any event, I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter.	1.0133819997515054
Before concluding, I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France, Austria and Germany, in particular, in the last few weeks, and at the same time we shall once again be discussing, together with my fellow Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France.	1.4764517293279669
I shall therefore reserve the right, if you permit, sir, to give you my own opinion, which, to a great extent, matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using Objective 2.	1.436623569902827
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow.	1.1409772816946155
We shall then have an appropriate tool for working, particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms.	1.1377541209140096
Indeed, this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms.	1.31734673325486
In conclusion, with thanks for your understanding, Mr President, I should like to thank you, Mrs Schroedter, for the quality of your work and that of the committee, and to tell you that I am very pleased, apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines. We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view.	1.5270038139376336
I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines, which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes.	1.2471383287168845
This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes. I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions, at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken, good joint working practice, which is, Mr Hatzidakis, backed up by something I am very attentive to: observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.	1.3276067649694827
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.1800861409464389
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union	0.5709495092444522
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].	0.9171681978641566
Mr President, Commissioner, this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.	1.0919601299678259
I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.	1.3081184562793675
The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions.	1.4744997347920816
In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1.306917441270994
Finally, in my view, this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe, particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions.	1.360711821976319
Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.	1.3050379462067887
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Berend has just presented and congratulates the author, both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility, which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.	1.2590309817509842
It must be remembered that, currently, the European Union' s overall competitiveness is, in general terms, 81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units, that is the regions, also improves. Furthermore, this is at a time when technological development, economic globalisation and our problems, which are enlargement and the single currency, demand that the regions, as well as businesses and individuals, make more of an effort to be competitive.	1.4510247018063545
The European Commission' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions.	1.0395272085529021
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur, one positive and one negative.	1.1914643756951415
The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities.	1.5568309569415473
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.	1.077966695312498
It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.	0.8911094209857061
This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period.	1.5932651626728342
Thus, Mr President, I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as other speakers have done, to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006.	1.3531648389507847
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.	1.1915931300396696
The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union' s regional policy aims.	1.0410612840807638
The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts.	1.0377144122893434
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe.	0.7229169676089092
The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average, whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.	1.0034252671069679
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.	1.1313583065783792
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences, long distances, climates that are too cold or too hot, sparse populations and austere conditions?	1.0692295918741044
How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development?	1.3472406355903008
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more remote areas.	1.3144956860517931
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility.	1.2631480538101092
Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased.	1.1946490188798637
This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.	0.8484793597059386
In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.	1.256265974767686
For example, uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration.	1.1122525783296955
In this connection, too, weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development.	0.9779199587884472
It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how.	1.012808199126259
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.	1.1278964582861912
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union' s regional policy has, until now, not been able to interpret, in any significant way, the existing differences in our inhabitants' incomes.	1.4220845458841447
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty, as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached, on average, 23.7% in the regions worst affected, regions which also happen to be poor areas, whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment, corresponding to the richer areas, unemployment stands at just 4%.	1.4033474709180092
Given this situation, the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment: measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes, which are often misspent, with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems, with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks, which are due in 2007.	1.3525910199338018
There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries' agriculture and fisheries, which are often harmed by the European Union' s own insensitive policies, as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs, particularly for women and young people. Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.	1.3986077255903293
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berend' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.	1.4712178281130852
The overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation, boosting equality of opportunity, increasing the sustainability of employment and development, are only mentioned in passing.	1.1790138087004791
This attitude appears to me to be unjustified. I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.	1.3559023422409038
This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness, particularly as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region, that is in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises.	1.3674418597457312
It is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regions, that is to say job creation measures, special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business.	1.192081716740392
They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities.	0.7929312386327415
Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development, simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions.	1.0978062651938272
After all, the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all.	1.1208825248521652
Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer.	1.0806684813899632
And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and, to a lesser extent, in rationalisation.	1.3473325077538134
It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas.	1.2599338344696147
The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions.	0.7716655088948564
In other words, what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.	1.1429370063706505
For example, these would be measures for vocational training, for further education, for re-integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process, for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements, in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again.	1.4115873814992244
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report.	1.2698282189189527
The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union.	1.2071854528991588
By stimulating a diversity of investments, the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment.	1.1174498009081526
From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.	1.0251797456466014
The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase, not really a satisfying result over a period during which, certainly over the past couple of years, there has been economic growth.	1.2381022965758528
As indicated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measures, on the other hand, are minimal as far as employment is concerned.	1.326833401615327
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for.	0.9113822690174913
Also, the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.	1.085978308553669
Mr President, it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities, especially in connection with boosting employment.	1.2607016518603562
It is, after all, they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.	1.096146921922482
By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and, if necessary, tying this in with financial aid, a higher return can be achieved.	1.0955566844467448
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.	0.6264291491484886
I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions.	1.4791301388990592
Following on from this, it is probably also more meaningful, with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say anyway.	1.481968009710293
By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.	1.4064036752672104
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.	1.3028960172801078
The report shows that, in general, they are a long way behind EU countries, especially in terms of GDP per capita.	1.3213427236098796
With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future, it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy. I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.	1.305795181720859
Mr President, Commissioner, following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.	1.3768108742133707
For example, whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased, there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect.	1.3338402497158588
Equally, unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all, indeed they rose in some cases.	1.2738630908984083
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.	1.2375914938987653
Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries.	1.1906057762224227
Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment, then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.	1.2732222969378595
Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base.	0.9846581437914814
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term, then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.	1.1564424878921074
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.	1.4419990826079059
Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report, because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.	1.5110011611361849
This issue, which has an impact on their everyday life, is a key issue as regards EU credibility.	1.4942223836127209
It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided, I would say quite magnificently, the development of poor countries.	1.4068850233044092
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago.	1.0362700509270317
In this connection, French speakers would speak of a "coup de chapeau" : in other words, I take my hat off to the EU.	1.1727777283291694
The EU really deserves such a gesture, but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great.	1.1654978816543322
What is the result?	1.3144957630630958
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.	0.849552811992608
Consequently, we have to build schools, hospitals, and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over.	1.6500666742742576
This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems.	1.1751245920329416
Most people, however, would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised, if they were given the chance to, in other words, if there was work there.	1.7484980430999078
We must give them this opportunity.	0.7681714108480964
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have.	1.4656122153632205
The solution, as I see it, lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.	1.0706452408047673
By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business, but creating will.	1.2432768167927966
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life, whether he or she is an employee, the owner of a business or an official.	1.232716033046572
What is a fair society?	1.0161418179970212
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children.	1.092439773822026
In this way, positive development of the regions is also possible, because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.	1.3639408717852113
Finally, I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America, where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as it often is here in Europe.	1.43156492099837
Mr President, Commissioner, as my time is limited, I shall get straight to the point.	1.549905462601815
Firstly, let me make a statement of fact: the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the Union.	1.2573965605095492
The most remote regions, still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates, offer one example of this.	0.8793722835735681
In Reunion, for example, the rate is 37%.	1.0139743154065026
This is not a situation related to the economic climate, however; rather it is a structural problem, created by our remoteness, our insularity, in short, our own specific personality.	1.5287730634957135
The principle of specific, exceptional treatment was envisaged in Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such cases.	1.0482593088786247
It only remains to put this principle into practice.	0.9300501065509252
The Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January, then February, and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism.	1.3266188536513128
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission.	0.9868891073284946
As regards taxation, state aid, the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products, practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency.	1.0384975941762302
If these do not materialise, then, unfortunately, convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us, and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions, despite the size of the amounts committed, will end in failure.	1.254536167117818
Mr President, as all the previous speakers have done, I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report.	1.378528506126972
Just like the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it supports and your own comments, ladies and gentlemen, shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006.	1.4027373845577178
I should also like to make a few comments, firstly, Mr Berend, regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report.	1.24581389567251
You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote, if I am not mistaken, that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports.	1.5028762197369583
On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this House and by yourself.	1.5239941617089365
The Commission was certainly very anxious to ensure, Mr Berend, that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.	1.376634019322217
I am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2.1 of this report, where the Commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported, improved and influenced by factors which some of you - Mr Markov, just now, and Mrs Raschhofer - stressed very forcefully.	1.254727461332419
I am thinking of technological research and development, infrastructure provision and quality, human resources potential, small and medium-sized businesses and direct investment from abroad.	1.1126769751645673
So much for the quality.	0.927319963853654
I do not wish to spend time right now, Mr Berend, going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your House has already endorsed.	1.2984392506420805
Let me just itemise them: the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy, particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the Member States.	1.404900301183293
Secondly, partnership, a subject which a number of you stressed, the role of local and regional authorities, the private sector, both sides of industry, associations and local community action groups.	1.4927388113457811
Regarding this problem of partnership, I shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the Structural Funds regulations are applied properly.	1.2828768230809817
Thirdly, the need to develop the employment side of growth, even though I am aware, as Mr van Dam just said, that the prime responsibility is that of the Member States, and that, when we speak of the responsibility of Member States, and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy, we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in.	1.5701847404438403
Mr Fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably.	0.9330106480883201
Mr Fruteau, we at least need to recognise that there is growth, and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession, as has been the case in the past.	1.4304283322393168
You will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike.	0.8453347398772462
I agree with your analysis.	0.9900216459988385
When there is growth, it must be better distributed, but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness, be they the most remote or island regions, is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades.	1.3461683723001452
Fourthly, a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.	1.1677064162626067
Fifthly, the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.	1.3397984311346962
Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission.	1.2809062950260286
In relation to this, I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds.	1.328451960883006
I should like to mention a few specific points.	1.0199220670214786
Mr Berend, you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly.	1.1889288009296426
Well, we are coming to an end of the zoning phase.	1.597071505497455
Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy' s turn.	1.4668955296892587
You may therefore be satisfied on this point, since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by Objective 2.	1.2841275502949838
Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and, as Mr Cocilovo mentioned, there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data.	1.3603661642706142
To a certain extent, they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and, in any case, I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.	1.2093358732955457
Mr Berend, you also mentioned, as did Mr Aparicio Sánchez, the lack of reform in the fisheries sector.	1.3888960564148427
On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.	1.4775716542730402
This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries, under Commissioner Fischler.	1.1428026305936638
Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns.	1.517480214395616
Several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion, and your rapporteur mentioned some of these.	1.217800317701436
I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy.	1.4644817847116438
In any event, I have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report: the definition, compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe; a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned, particularly Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau; analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This will constitute a great challenge to us all, for you and for the Commission, in the next few years.	1.4019621479235758
And finally, there are the cross-border aspects. I shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points.	1.4187643861032864
Finally, I should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are, in any case, familiar with, but whose main elements I should like to reiterate.	1.4121019329949465
Ladies and gentlemen, considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence, particularly for the four cohesion countries, but also frankly, Mr Pohjamo, for the Objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development, especially regarding infrastructure.	1.498443391303157
This is my first point regarding the policy.	0.9520921454528791
My second point regarding the policy is as follows: the Structural Funds have made, and continue to make, a significant contribution to the convergence process.	1.4255515014603783
All the macroeconomic models we are working on show that, over the last decade, more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the Structural Funds.	1.2034632161711742
I have, however, taken note, particularly with regard to the most remote regions, Mrs Sudre, Mr Fruteau, and Mr Nogueira Román too, that your observation is that there is still much to do - and this is my third point regarding the policy - in terms of improving employment take-up aspects, the fight against social exclusion, which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions, and the integration of women and young people into the labour market.	1.504820839905259
Now to my fourth point regarding the policy; enlargement of the Union, the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions, the major challenge, too, for the European policy on cohesion, a point which Mr van Dam highlighted.	1.4222626511845458
I shall say that something is already taking shape in Berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us.	1.397824505680535
I am thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument, which I shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks.	1.1607772593096657
You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the Union' s enlargement on our structural policy.	1.3025020847764273
This sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole, Mr Berend, is a good basis for our thinking, for us all and for myself.	1.4828851530537446
I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines, as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006.	1.4329967512023751
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.47513528222732565
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946

Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	0.4510321946745718
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	0.3735514178617478
Are there any comments?	0.1337831580886173
Mr President, I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes.	1.3356517794919966
I refer to item 11 on the order of business.	0.7277985276148794
Firstly, I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated.	1.343365759669663
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group.	1.108292731590576
The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament, as other speakers remarked yesterday, can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission.	1.564744634914963
We should also have the humility to recognise that, if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House, so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were.	1.3771198228312023
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this.	1.477833990449632
When there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future, we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance.	1.3753042476113746
There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission.	1.3092161382230065
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.	1.1233543285222156
Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday, I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly.	1.4234837340512214
That is something for which I have a deep appreciation.	1.5904184661920133
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.	1.2550352219139842
It should not be dramatised into something more than that.	0.7115666292734143
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.	0.829956997279629
I understand what you are saying.	0.9136257071024245
We have taken note of this.	0.6239446148163464
Mr President, concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business, we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today's agenda.	1.397661614326826
However, it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.	1.4881444453834056
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today's agenda.	0.6226735712694599
Mr Wynn, that makes sense.	1.3058001763753129
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.	0.7432711378576402
Mr President, regarding Mrs Lynne's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building, I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower.	1.2884099052875744
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.	1.1547258447861493
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly, but this is a serious problem.	1.4041514407108922
Mrs Ahern, we have taken note of this.	1.2352222486321962
I would ask you to bring this specific case, which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor, to the attention of the Quaestors, who are, in fact, responsible for the matter.	1.4134074745831098
We will also pass this on to our services, however.	1.2863561567325665
Thank you very much.	0.6600835891524878

Reform of European competition policy	0.42197811751486586
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	0.5807876034932212
A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty [COM(1999) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)];	0.8277146623944484
A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy 1998 [SEK(1999) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)];	0.9648123692527873
A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors. [COM(1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)] (Report 1995-1997);	0.9652808846981261
A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No. 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code). [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)].	0.8702192590401747
Mr President, Commissioner, today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union' s competition policy.	1.1549748196229732
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.	1.3163453774081944
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term "modernisation" to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression "retrograde step" .	1.3357888298031275
However, we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998, and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.	1.5390948379915674
But, of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper.	1.280613119374371
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy.	1.2915855282717805
On reading both Commission documents, one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed, which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.	1.140689947947146
Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture. As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned.	1.5665778139314221
It should continue along this path.	0.7362587961973178
But, Commissioner, none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union, the deepening of the internal market, technological progress, globalisation.	1.2650937349846874
Indeed, it is not just about modernisation of Community law, more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases, about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions, for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population' s acceptance, together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned.	1.404612073356416
Only, without transparency there will be no acceptance, indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.	1.3965589973665073
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.	1.3587643376575136
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought, Commissioner, but there is one point that I would just like to go into now. Transparency and accountability belong together.	1.3367532030119225
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.	1.2190622237237037
The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role, for the sake of its own independence; but Parliament is a supervisory body, and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament, indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion?	1.4367171157193857
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen, strengthening and intensifying it.	1.141708443868302
There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though. Parliament is a legislative body, but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law, of all things, is truly scandalous.	1.7438573952156162
Therefore, I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area.	1.5371599518863117
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases, even given the Treaty status quo.	1.174838302389729
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures.	1.0531393240574976
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions.	1.2462920266269026
With all due respect for the principle of competition, competition is not, however, an end in itself.	1.3317867853074514
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions.	0.9094654436521776
At the end of the day, one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue.	1.1350126031301273
Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts.	0.9397145260961804
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord.	0.9773981541901733
Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses, monopolies law being one example.	1.0590445583887105
But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation.	1.093170614917518
Competition yes, restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible.	1.0302568880824148
However, since state aid forms the lion' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like, regardless of Mr Jonckheer' s report, to say one more thing about it.	1.3227751744737468
It is certainly possible, indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy.	1.3296550439842327
Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition.	1.1523718683877087
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible.	1.2669638339775153
It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives.	1.3150542442766202
My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party.	1.1921411259935657
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties.	1.3866071928505097
The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors, according to various typologies, such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued.	1.14745245235155
Let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid, on average, for the period under review, is in the order of EUR 95 billion, corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995, a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany.	1.2885815062088584
To put it plainly, the level of state aid declared, roughly speaking, is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent, coincidentally, of the Community budget for one year.	1.3365147938922697
This being the case, there are considerable disparities between states, which may be measured in various ways, such as, for example, as a percentage of added value and per wage earner.	1.282932458120874
I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid, which may be assimilated in some way into state aid.	1.386366165197549
This clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund, among other things, which come at the top of the list.	1.1896819741606368
This being the case, let me now come to the proposals made in the report.	1.1626159954754085
We note, first of all, that the committee considers the data, as presented in the Commission' s annual report, to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate, sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition, pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty.	1.3594965354496515
The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States.	0.9255599149944888
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided, and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect.	1.527594089914689
It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example, has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid, accessible via the Internet.	1.2431141275649509
Having better, more detailed information available, particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded, must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies.	1.4557861539738781
And insofar as such studies already exist, to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties, which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.	1.5320472782229673
By stressing, primarily, the quality of the information provided, our debate in committee, and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you, avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was, in absolute terms, either too high or not high enough.	1.4037808770801854
Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and, on the other hand, acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty, particularly, as I have said already, as regards sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion.	1.3059524605020167
This being the case, various amendments to the rapporteur' s initial draft report were adopted in committee, particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results.	1.1963362018215271
Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting.	0.7565840979933723
Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid, in view of the inadequacies, acknowledged or not, of private investment alone, the market failures or inadequacies of the market.	1.277223086854525
There is in particular one amendment, let me point out, concerning the energy sector, which, in my capacity as rapporteur, I see as particularly important.	1.4727346977721287
I should like to conclude this presentation, Commissioner, by stressing two things: firstly, a concern of the members of the committee and, secondly, a demand of our committee.	1.5174236929730034
The concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in terms of competition policy and state aid.	1.063822118768297
This is undoubtedly a complex issue, and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter, particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and, as far as state aid is concerned, the need, in all probability, to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors.	1.4915714530076816
And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.3607734575536425
As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.	1.1846417647896053
Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today' s debate concerns the steel aid code, that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission.	1.3716354494371767
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these.	1.4279645854409986
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly.	0.934383148475838
Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future.	1.4506514313738446
The European Commission' s decisions, which feature in the report, are welcomed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty.	1.4718719290282136
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament.	1.5091684971068393
As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry.	1.254538155261669
According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle. Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases.	1.4134463101136274
Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid.	1.2351372343207931
In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.	0.9029398670641322
Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid.	1.3044299532211805
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996.	0.8206620515756831
These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether.	1.2235007309325139
In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece.	1.1144810814199593
However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report.	1.3492293743803516
As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired.	1.2824144160301598
There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code.	0.9358415661821757
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe.	0.6431816697065131
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years.	1.3023628350040093
Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations.	1.5675924767037073
We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind.	1.3024796254329323
The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission' s supervision.	1.398440864468688
We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires, steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94, for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.	1.3683856155785588
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code.	0.9731719561430957
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments.	1.152914500874858
What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets.	1.2167293647300974
We also need to criticise the Commission' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view, do not fall within the categories of the code, even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned.	1.2166315427622103
The Commission will be called upon, in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999, to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions, thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made.	1.3990803073201967
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions, I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity, which we have ourselves created, in plenary sitting.	1.3945984535396874
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market is not complete.	1.1443219063154457
Subsidies, monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike.	0.9140106500372077
National governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time, but then it happens again.	1.4141460549827323
Subsidies distort allocations, both within and between countries.	1.1846445571556221
A successive phasing out of State aid is required, and more and more markets must be opened up to competition.	1.2223354018266244
This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies, both private and public.	1.2223317040481672
Public monopolies are, more often than not, phased out reluctantly.	1.1044553926304668
Increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare, including within the spheres of education, health care and social services.	1.0905567633806441
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures.	0.6729118828648848
Europe must be modernised, made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies.	1.1680808221994183
Effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living.	0.6392192360484427
It is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently.	1.0622216904444248
In fact, competition policy and consumer policy belong together.	1.2827201843776177
The internal market is the basis for our work.	1.5332617848336507
Its legislation is to apply equally to all, to large and small countries alike.	1.2003809744941891
A systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled.	1.1071742066340704
The EU' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed.	1.1427742741673157
The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy.	1.0437757441014757
In order to be effective, it must be well anchored in the Member States' national authorities.	1.2663751568605008
In six months' time, it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation' s effects upon the Commission' s role.	1.3516089489057013
The question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests.	1.0602252708257707
This will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed.	1.284632398719726
There will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate.	1.1522581004244339
The law must be correctly applied in matters of competition.	0.7668102924300221
Wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership, which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for.	1.1507304980657416
We have a quite exciting debate in front of us.	1.0554377406830129
A conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to straighten out misunderstandings, at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points.	0.9856240029951177
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens.	1.3530899212748366
In fact, in my own constituency of Stockholm, we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies.	1.3683186891687136
We would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay.	1.1482276225045245
We hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law.	1.2323774433948234
Mr President, as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today, even though there has been a delay.	1.4291621693039371
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau, Mr Langen, Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation.	1.6193136188430053
Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors, where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service.	1.2832620964347543
All this is to the good of the consumer.	1.278767332813056
But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further.	1.3551151489993334
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points: dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	0.9860908076297553
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs, at any rate.	0.9185626927673659
At the same time, this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world, of course.	1.1798733507569668
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.	1.2469585070173916
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape.	1.0885935468557506
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	0.5892473937683406
If we are to create a culture of law in Europe, then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission, by central bodies, but also by national authorities, by national courts.	1.4894257402938973
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally, it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty.	1.3316400554933467
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter.	1.31084035312217
The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear, something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion.	1.2936392173041225
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy.	1.215595898960482
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted, then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined.	1.5288615104057837
However, when it comes to what the future holds for competition, there are two issues dear to my heart.	1.4596508134033288
One is subsidiarity.	0.345148581146423
We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency, and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions.	1.4100800841792926
Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union.	0.992866369595555
I would cite, by way of example, the issue of job creation schemes, savings banks and regional banks, and Gütesiegel.	1.2203178095206961
Here, a region has, by its own efforts, created a means of marketing its own products.	1.4473802021545017
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention.	0.9175294828938276
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation.	1.0473680630759845
We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other.	1.1617567317244426
My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy, although I am not going to talk about market failure just now.	1.0877466329191932
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector, but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters.	1.2771881112835761
These days, someone who lives in an old people' s home is accommodated within the social field.	0.9830256109476947
However, I could also regard them as a customer, and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field, that is evolved structures, stifle competition.	1.357535206966722
Apart from that, I could refer to any customers, any sector, as customers, and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields.	1.4745993438549545
To conclude, I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes, they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe.	1.5260251202288981
Thank you very much, Mr Radwan.	1.0223969931191883
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary-speak, inappropriately in your case, as a maiden speech.	1.3140889447329085
Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member, Robert Goebbels, who is unable to attend due to a political commitment.	1.2597296379615703
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market.	1.1191271176729696
A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures.	0.7044227986106685
Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market, it would not make any difference to the real world.	1.3906953234084223
Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources.	1.0691762710885915
While, since the dawn of time, the market has been the key forum for human interchange, it has never been perfect.	1.5000189689035144
The market favours the short term and immediate profits.	0.9200728795041304
On the market, the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties, consumers and workers.	1.1997532245394678
In order to function, the market needs rules.	1.1876073786613806
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society.	0.9437652001325585
We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose.	1.2331476221799498
The market is not an end in itself; it must help to improve the human condition.	1.1956027677683987
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators, but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion.	1.4066970779934647
Finally, aid can enable restructuring, offer training, save jobs and thus know-how.	1.2398353796372152
The main objective of the Union' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid.	1.199618621080741
This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union, particularly economic and social cohesion, sustainable development and research.	1.2253163917263468
The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market.	1.177201214426885
It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid.	1.0404859276011311
The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research financed by the American army.	1.3782840219680887
The World Wide Web, which has enabled the meteoric development of the information society, was developed by CERN in Geneva, once again with public aid.	1.3127266361855356
The German Government' s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy.	0.9710178537240576
President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness, the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism.	1.2232592071693584
I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund, LTCM.	0.9940426919308839
Wishing to save 60 000 jobs is, apparently, a sin against the market, but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market.	1.3161206408454453
Public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation, as was the case in Mexico, Asia and Brazil.	1.1495810480935362
Human labour, on the other hand, is considered to be a simple factor in the equation.	1.347197970940855
We Socialists reject the liberals' naïve optimism on this point.	0.7337126331958356
We want a true culture of competition in Europe.	1.0590211297253296
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge.	1.2080950431258963
Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation.	1.2154254933160238
I want to thank you, Commissioner Monti, for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that, as we enter the new millennium, you have an especially important role.	1.5635285891579684
It is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments. These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy, but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless.	1.264015089039309
Let me mention the latest examples we have seen: Holzmann, a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government; sawmills in former East Germany; and, especially, aid to shipyards.	1.1605226715854122
These are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets.	1.0672815225280574
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and, to that extent, are helping to undermine the value of the euro.	1.3813456934084345
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee, all concerning state aid.	0.9682220647894038
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness, which is very important with a view to making the internal market work.	1.348344142489761
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	0.8334338454783078
As I say, our amendments concern transparency, and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful, specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be.	1.3128138810428154
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful.	1.4649993872438944
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back?	1.0473113240217478
At present, there are no common rules in this area, and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment.	1.3927183799359617
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition.	1.4364728872876797
Finally, we propose keeping both a register, as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs, and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid.	1.5033123647335978
You have shown us the way, Mr Monti, with the single market scoreboard.	1.3932507305451098
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid.	1.1199555065225253
I very much hope that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these amendments, and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter.	1.3969379887650397
To conclude, I want to welcome the Commission' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy, on which, once again, a good deal of work has been done.	1.4666391971069643
But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness.	1.229705955367296
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid.	1.2965553409208899
This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who, in his report, has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria, as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition.	1.3683055015920766
As Liberals and Greens, we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look, but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives, and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems.	1.4812326441364672
Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered.	1.2856450975058227
Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy, and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy?	1.296345600248442
Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid.	1.5291643369170405
It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements.	1.2143264510556342
So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified.	1.4633342668696432
The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level.	0.8316558702492314
We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything.	1.5042487193829515
We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact.	1.2011029171245478
Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union' s competition policy.	1.508690289029266
But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us.	1.308541997016321
The overriding features of today' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups.	0.9214516828806706
Should we not be discussing this issue?	0.8066158370581037
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies.	1.1783265122581454
Certain sectors of European industry, such as the shipbuilding industry, air transport and the steel industry, which have been hard hit by existing competition policy, have suffered tremendously.	1.2126879925083969
They have lost their status, and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant.	1.4347836430526901
When will we debate that?	0.7471265725271072
The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states, and Member States of the Union at that.	1.2012378270155002
And yet, we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid.	1.0972062637921933
At the same time, unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.	0.9042230565939264
Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights.	1.1449094946747718
Consumers see their standard of living being eroded, poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition, in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business.	1.168978515531914
We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it.	1.180406528626985
Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of this pivotal year, prior to the changeover to the single currency, the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment.	1.3825839077131852
The competition policy has, as far as these resources permitted, contributed to this event.	1.2030988015761124
For our part, we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which, far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency, imprisons us in an artificial straitjacket, which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe.	1.187791492149562
Having said that, governing means planning. It also means being responsible and, in this new context which has been forced upon us, competition law naturally has an essential role to play.	1.4036620736716061
In this area, the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action: acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices, by refocusing its departments' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest Community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law.	1.0897902158134392
As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints.	1.2534896153448751
Finally, on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction.	1.179778210366347
The Commission is, in fact, retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities, but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all.	1.3798071937605116
National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control.	1.1594098265270654
In conclusion, I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction, we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which, if it were realised, would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states.	1.3610697209132792
Mr President, Commissioner, we have a basically positive view of the Commission' s White Paper on competition, particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation, but we are also puzzled by several things.	1.3938800929304087
First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes.	1.4022441472111813
In this respect, we should heed the words of von Eieck, and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni, who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies.	1.261341779191448
State interference in the economy is, even today, still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market, competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers.	1.5141214467813362
There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann.	1.3059441380518582
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option.	1.4459417970216673
Commissioner, I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties, but I believe that, it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy, especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition.	1.412614168887876
What is being done may well be very important, but it is still not sufficient.	1.3999564864483445
Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave.	1.4973560882679964
It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that.	0.9107514952176446
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense.	1.2931084472630627
I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views.	0.9309902089335144
I also assume that you, Commissioner, want to honour the reputation of, and the work put in by, your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective.	1.2306492080769986
I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner, but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless.	1.1570470432528734
Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application.	1.3986928045786136
In general, I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market.	1.183951133047458
The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application.	1.1433916019997514
It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way.	1.1905492623754188
The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities.	1.3602626529483945
But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward.	1.0809256212179814
So, I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible.	1.2161652286447737
Secondly, I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty.	1.3097266489289687
Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern.	0.797696487483959
This instrument will fall by the wayside in future.	0.7131649930319534
In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next?	1.3938821746476462
Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy.	1.222989952853886
I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection, as is already the case, one has got to admit, within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector.	1.2333104214167514
Fourthly, I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules.	1.3431799660566794
Fifthly, with the pending enlargement, I wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game.	1.432669279044645
They are still in training, as it were.	1.2952461229881231
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market?	1.1227128179910755
Sixthly and lastly, I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions, namely the legal privilege of company lawyers.	1.4467163229548299
If the Commission implements the White Paper objectives, it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable.	1.191729297999974
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege?	1.080249622862927
Commissioner, I am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and I hope that, in this sense, we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit.	1.4392017120712668
Mr President, I would like, in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau.	1.3429860971667487
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure.	1.2678621139526391
We are, therefore, in agreement with the report, Commissioner, as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper.	1.22511527738325
Since the Treaty entered into force, Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy.	1.1370921064537962
After almost forty years of being in force, these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion. For this reason, modernisation was essential.	1.1761991858351206
That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons. Firstly, the authorisation system; secondly, decentralised application; thirdly, procedural rules; fourthly, judicial application; and fifthly and finally, excessive red tape.	1.23362875152099
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform, as was unanimously requested by specialised companies, academics and lawyers.	1.0963259093170878
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system.	1.1428200245624784
A system, such as the current one, which is capable of making so few decisions, be they approvals or prohibitions, is something less than a valid system.	1.2434720611053522
National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81(1) and 82 for some time.	1.0517775821087605
However, they could not apply Article 81(3), which, to a certain extent, prevented the coherent application of Article 81(1).	1.2613144562596312
You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice, both brought by German courts, which question the feasibility of applying 81(1) without being able to apply 81(3).	1.2147885711837183
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary.	1.0534901626476307
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762.	0.9584297163659612
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous.	0.9183781759012082
The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure, that it did not establish time limits, that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files, or that the right to defence was not properly recognised, were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform.	1.4101916984704717
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994, the Commission published a communication on this subject.	1.3643516598238556
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach.	0.6391924529504125
One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape.	1.0944792845147042
As a consequence of the continental legal tradition, consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market.	1.0201695269538626
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis.	0.7854192572932535
The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals.	1.2001837623995533
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report.	1.112072906914656
Amongst these, firstly, is the fact that, despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82, Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight.	1.3449887008962724
At the moment, with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them, the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important.	1.1342070848353762
Secondly, Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation.	1.2300994266168825
For these reasons, we are going to vote in favour of the report.	1.1068046365986965
However, if some of the amendments are accepted, particularly those presented by the PPE-DE Group, we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document, lacking in rigour and, in that event, we would reconsider our support.	1.5577065005771422
Mr President, amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate, I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer, that is to say, the modernisation of competition policy, which is the subject of the Commission' s White Paper.	1.4370614946754319
Frankly, I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory.	1.1905237109554618
Through his management, Commissioner Monti achieves good results, as did his predecessor and, clearly, he has established a guarantee which, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately, without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged, as has happened in the European Union since 1993.	1.4932330945920356
If it functions well, if we are satisfied, if the Commission has basically acted correctly, why the need for the modification?	1.4553278311335107
Various arguments have been presented in its favour.	0.9455820360983758
Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis, justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition, but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States, are truly identical in all regions.	1.2626523505005487
Because, if this is not the case, we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market.	1.4681928697019184
In that event we would not have moved forward, but rather backwards, in the application of competition policy in the Union.	1.5544208184065467
Mr President, I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, when compared to previous reports.	1.3613023061834726
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way.	1.1339009882618265
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country, which I represent - a margin for action, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity.	1.3424311154020905
Nevertheless, I cannot forget the numerous criticisms, both from Member States and from market operators, which, given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases, maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment, the planning of company mergers etc.	1.3236028796935844
The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval, through individual cases, which will take more than six or eight months to resolve, an excessively long period, which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility, affecting the generation of wealth and employment.	1.2701059199576321
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations, lay down clear rules, which will benefit all of us: businesspeople, investors, workers and the citizens in general.	1.274611833244433
Mr President, I would like to stress that, in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.	1.3107329176626625
From the point of view of economic growth, and therefore of increasing employment and wealth, safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor, and one that is certainly very important for our future.	1.4521567609182096
This is why I give this report my full support.	1.1523568502786643
Recently, I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner, precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility, both for products and for services.	1.429816550750559
I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future, for Europe' s economy, and, above all, for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general.	1.4660460680199607
Mr President, for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union.	1.2300490864447793
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined.	0.9784555487469859
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete.	1.049720359946457
During my six months as a Member of this Parliament, I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project.	1.3290446178408655
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe.	1.1421747919362724
But all this, in effect, is so much rhetoric when we look at the national, regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market.	1.2659319821354376
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission's proposals.	1.6414953537832349
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti.	1.266127865507878
We look to him as the man to root out cartels.	0.9481651570462789
But he would recognise that, as for everybody else, we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination. That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr von Wogau.	1.4135159544151854
I want to congratulate him, sadly in his absence, for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side!	1.455453370475031
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.	1.1946912022156244
So although I may not share his conclusions, I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address.	1.5813090725205796
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy.	0.9537493800896111
I know that the Commission is set against this, but the potential exists.	1.6382566527620728
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities.	0.9350605908330203
I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process.	0.929830459520316
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation.	1.2115678532243643
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court.	1.1732755236851828
Well, we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment.	1.5975762576231332
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment, in which we have the support of the Commission.	1.5958441476951353
Unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point, in the Factortame case, in which the British Government was the defendant, it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling.	1.582406053536806
So, judicially, something needs to be done.	1.1232593548693746
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area.	1.3566872611759155
In relation to legal certainty, I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen.	1.1762251928375684
It is important that business has legal certainty.	0.6380798171871581
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently.	0.8697865186758261
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers.	1.137230234015719
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom.	1.147291892696935
We all have, as it were, our histories to live with, but it is important that business has legal certainty.	1.2359243667100985
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business: a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy.	1.220024120784521
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change.	1.2879749400496467
We have been told how, currently, people's time is being wasted and that the changes, therefore, could be beneficial.	1.235390182413756
But I really feel that, in the circumstances, we want to know what the implications would be for business.	1.4392947394322302
Finally, we, as British Conservatives, are looking for a change in direction, towards the development of an independent competition authority.	1.5894924869729359
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that.	1.2473633002925009
Mr President, the European Union' s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began.	1.282294173799195
It is an integral part of the tension, inherent in the very concept of European integration, between solidarity and cooperation between Member States, with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy, and competition, which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union as an entity.	1.4149231281769528
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies.	1.33863939593358
We can be proud of a European competition culture, for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality.	1.3840727912334616
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision.	0.6541420364950283
However, we must be vigilant in the face of global operators, against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits.	1.3475675375692222
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier, who described the state of the world in terms of the economy' s reign of terror.	1.4797734452565505
Society is surrendering itself to the economy.	0.7667518202633679
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union.	1.1185141349719165
We are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check, not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan, or others, until we get the international competition law we so badly need.	1.3217356282799597
European competition policy, as we very often forget, is not just important for fair competition as such, but also for prices, growth and employment, and hence for the public.	1.6677520077450143
In common with the other Members, I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned.	1.2270359908030106
It is essential that this long overdue step be taken.	1.0320298353323323
It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection.	1.1276776598286244
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament, as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations, consumer protection associations and the public.	1.2412688431151564
Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy.	0.9237794359659082
Then it is possible to understand that, for example, lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy, and Brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are, of course, bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context.	1.2100925422530588
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement.	1.0912420018425877
Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis.	1.3532552689138748
At the same time, it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose, with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives.	1.152387669933505
A word on the White Paper: the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy.	1.01836680133313
I am opposed to this, unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group, because I believe that, in competition policy terms, the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met, and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation.	1.4070928125021955
The system currently in force creates transparency, affords enterprises legal certainty and has, without a shadow of a doubt, led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement.	0.9868947999239894
The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system.	1.3566261571387213
Indeed, it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty.	1.2104238256670323
Mr President, I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so.	1.2875625742601495
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions.	1.115195666144793
For example, the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion, which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990.	1.3064130580397793
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy, which I hope it will be able to meet because, for certain, many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale.	1.2455498580333706
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices.	1.0923285341388096
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element, and, particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that.	1.4433632727848182
Mr President, in the limited time I have, I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here, in particular by Mr Jonckheer, who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid.	1.2507419392885772
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82, especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration.	1.1925416426269337
As a Member for the Basque Country, I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market.	1.1758883679917975
I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general, and Mr Monti, in particular, for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid.	1.6002473456332713
Our discrepancy stems from the fact that the Commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our Basque fiscal rules the same nature, foundation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union, and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who, by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law, are subject to those rules.	1.2033777696488737
Mr President, Commissioner, competition is exactly what we need.	1.2757051284290917
We need competition if there is the least unemployment, for a smooth-running healthcare system, for social justice, for high social standards, and, of course, we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products, equal market access conditions for all enterprises, and environmentally-friendly products.	1.4348876436233482
In other words, we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics.	1.1869832176426125
I often have the impression, unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded, that very often the reverse is the case; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics.	1.2339337013872689
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this.	1.1076663341097706
But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand.	1.274998651657151
I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg, although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained.	1.2444579248132603
But these are competitive jobs, for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany.	1.1215259635866024
Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too.	1.2341457336448913
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve.	1.278249859448851
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics.	1.2471925291812505
Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people' s social welfare and boost purchasing power.	1.2101657847362843
To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply.	1.1294629717554812
Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today.	1.1963306992030789
I would like to quote verbatim from the report: "State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland. Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."	1.2368238916583707
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures.	1.3192282474109371
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation.	1.00987773168982
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus. This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe.	1.554893812184123
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper.	1.1078797318064324
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000.	1.1662130294988808
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace.	0.945053384739351
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage.	1.0998708911480233
Mr President, the monopolies' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe.	1.099478323039616
The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies' ban to be unsatisfactory, something I would wholeheartedly agree with.	1.0493647250354672
But opinion differs as to the solution.	0.8126931798078074
The Commission' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation.	1.1011944541572039
In other words, we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse.	1.320805246470218
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system.	0.8362951434192755
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law.	1.1454795859330331
We would be changing the law to make it executable again, which is something I consider to be unacceptable.	1.3880660923474044
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions.	1.187247866605936
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption, insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty on European Union allow.	1.0779494472887563
The requirement to lodge applications in Brussels will be dropped; in other words, the Commission will be completely in the dark in future.	1.129699541305649
This is unacceptable to my mind.	1.1720795346669242
The Commission' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States' courts.	1.3348971911768432
But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy.	1.2201273611922914
This is unacceptable in my view.	0.9510725549857771
It would weaken a key element of European policy.	0.7931704815532888
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned.	1.3993009495348527
There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition.	1.0482435166698325
In any case, the Commission' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties.	1.0376354442722129
There was no majority for this at the time.	0.9257435702451019
Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time, it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy.	1.0927665051621043
Forty years on, this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies, to the detriment of Europe' s consumers.	1.3532098637458314
I consider this to be unacceptable.	0.5111210872816468
Mr President, in this important debate on competition, I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen' s document on the Steel Aid Code.	1.4852419083752377
As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996, the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances.	1.073062490787167
Indeed, several years ago, this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector.	1.540973392094599
This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses, even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty.	1.2985284587509254
This indeed, is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code, but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	1.2613849985764303
It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research, development, environmental protection and cases of company closure.	1.1595867158682367
In the same category of ideas, it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies.	1.2868231944505206
The Commission suggests shorter deadlines.	0.6732347074735491
I agree with this request.	1.0871212803526895
Like the rapporteur, while I am pleased with the Commission report, nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid.	1.359059781678666
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code.	1.057489962131589
In the interests of equality, either the Code must be applied or it must be modified.	1.185442214271669
Finally, and in conclusion, Mr President, with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002, and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area.	1.6607124515624259
We therefore await, and I await, the European Commission' s proposals on this matter.	1.504964172634784
Mr President, I am also going to refer to the report by Mr Langen, which concerns aid to the steel industry.	1.4632681092788642
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues.	1.1656692445653298
Firstly, I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and, secondly, on the need for transparency with regard to this aid.	1.5555053778658614
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that, despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code, the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code.	1.1869261571112053
However, the thing that worries us most, Mr President, is the decrease in prices, by 30%, owing to imports.	1.4632030756931655
The reason for this decrease is unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan, in the case of steel, as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid.	1.2038222815920752
Orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically, resulting in a loss of jobs.	1.3056101869865553
I live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems: Asturias.	0.9833880523469363
With global markets, we need global employment laws and global subsidies.	1.2396732551104228
I know this is difficult to achieve now, but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers, here and elsewhere, and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries, here and elsewhere, it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it.	1.2580875339565685
Mr President, Commissioner, Director-General, I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report: I welcome the Commission' s open-minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules, and to propose practical reform measures.	1.36457204411789
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau, who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification, indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken, and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion.	1.2230531217116232
The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection, discussion, and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves, the judiciary, the Member States, and above all the SMEs concerned, that need to be clarified.	1.4762383723429802
Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy.	1.2160442431499008
However, it must be "europeanised" taking into account the principle of subsidiarity.	1.171743055713129
I also welcome, therefore, the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual, without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility.	1.2904327625344914
In practice, only 9 cases were rejected, 94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished, non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines, which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related, staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement	1.295966107639483
To conclude, I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform: fair competition and equal competition conditions, legal certainty for all enterprises, consistent application of competition policy, procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop, coordination of the national - and to me, independent - competition authorities, close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission, along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law, and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies.	1.375496936162234
I am in suspense as to how the discussions, which were broadly based, will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal.	1.525980807789387
The Commission report confirms that, with the exception of Germany, state aid to businesses is increasing.	1.2923507476325884
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition.	0.8272130521383768
As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes.	1.338763218321502
Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business.	0.9618104138621751
Take, for example, the car manufacturing sector, where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period.	1.269977724920163
With what aim?	0.344861641231872
Not to save jobs.	0.531305893831499
All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies.	0.7780716532182096
Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse.	1.158096148433929
Did these firms need state aid to survive?	0.8900372773350649
No, car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years.	1.005672766752136
State aid is not only counterproductive because, as the Jonckheer report acknowledges, it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another, but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders.	1.2885114482542004
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed.	1.1657573276012758
In voting against the Jonckheer report, I wish to assert the need for another policy, to wit, ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff.	1.1986974385354423
Mr President, today' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market.	1.276637624368181
In accordance with the principle of competition, the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94, competition policy in the strict sense, and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition.	1.2785353101850374
Firstly, fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, there have been direct provisions, the code of good conduct in particular.	1.2747738808096436
This has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca 'time goes by' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances.	1.3659654783005064
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions.	1.228077325762592
Firstly, it is necessary, in drawing up the legislation, to produce clear and complete rules.	1.687300414068263
It is probably horrendous, especially in this particular raft of legislation, that there are confused rules, regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts.	1.219398117362857
This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities.	1.378613444377846
Thirdly, it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission, in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies.	1.2292375906564197
Fourthly, and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed.	1.590328395956104
We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world.	1.3462487332232589
The principle of competition must now be universal in its application.	1.052587750768675
We must monitor compliance with environmental standards, employment standards, in order to prevent dumping in this area, and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid, which in many industries - as has already been said - distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory. To sum up, we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid, internal distortions by other countries, from being transferred to the international arena, in other words, through trickery.	1.3682361436808554
Mr President, Commissioner Monti, there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors.	1.2087279704060319
First of all the report reveals Parliament' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly.	1.3242459510743225
Many of the report' s conclusions, however, are cause for concern, at least for our group.	1.5196864519760087
For example, the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this.	1.1823262808973212
Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages, thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective, uneconomic division of Europe' s meagre resources.	0.9584106496190973
The form the aid takes is important.	0.7052947141657293
Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported.	1.0607520044439738
For example, state guarantees, on which the Commission has just publicised its position, must naturally be considered state aid, but they are, in my opinion, a better option than granting aid directly to companies.	1.4002193072085705
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency, which affects competitiveness.	1.2392646003610608
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets.	1.0847701007203954
If competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy, real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream.	1.4066540477902456
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights: we should not just be emphasising its social dimension.	1.4251750761768989
The aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth, not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy.	1.2068448164009828
Mr Rapkay' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law.	1.253116645960819
In my opinion, it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law.	1.0850510444489507
Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator, which will water down all the aims of competition policy.	1.1747368038043957
Mr President, Mr Monti, the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union, not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years, but also with a forward-looking view to the Union' s enlargement.	1.5328579962974904
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts.	1.3297068356613713
Moreover, I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor Tesauro, Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority, sent me, and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration.	1.3248542105192747
Our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market, and, above all, to achieve consistency between the different national markets. As things stand, there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English, Italian and French markets.	1.2489524964741356
There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy.	1.3147415087527685
Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement, which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment.	1.1054435838993522
In my opinion, we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed: small and medium-sized businesses, which bind the European economy together, and social protection, which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy.	1.3773198833788551
Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade, pure and simple, and a system for improving people' s quality of life.	1.3631517962145527
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected.	1.1455324664309057
We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral.	1.0076625876542908
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed.	1.4335629800485192
Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force.	1.433567629055041
A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition, marked by clear, uniform rules.	0.8933263776035906
In his report, Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well.	0.7755049438880579
But Europe is changing.	0.5701817240531994
The economies are growing, we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States.	1.1494804482191072
The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy.	1.071334698433722
It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy.	0.9290486473558653
This is not in question.	1.3061568961947951
Having said this, I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation.	1.0100504724113604
How will the Commission, as keeper of the Treaties, guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London, Palermo, Helsinki and, soon, Budapest and Ankara?	1.2350044313030897
This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented, and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given.	1.1733736806214101
It is not enough to say that, in the Member States, there is already 40 years' worth of experience.	1.529789663161501
In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy.	1.2983182709561165
This country has a very small market which, unfortunately, is often at the same time defined as the relevant market. This in contrast to Germany, where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market.	1.4016251165974356
The European Commission' s belief that, in all quarters of the Union, legislation will, almost as a matter of course, be interpreted in the same way, is what, within catholic circles, we term "foolhardy," and this is not allowed.	1.6529246115838723
Uniformity needs to be worked on.	0.6821696339217798
Think of specialist, national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court.	1.1262396182556096
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise.	0.8826945629192032
Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal.	1.4765001774781152
What is the Commissioner' s opinion of this?	1.2664322376496133
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses.	0.9928669534433174
In order to grant small and medium-sized companies greater security, the European Commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized businesses so that, alongside vertical exemptions, horizontal exemptions will also be possible.	1.28184166732961
Through cooperation, small, independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains.	1.14208986216476
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses.	1.1831229896793014
Moreover, regarding these small businesses, we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in, the yellow card, instead of an immediate red card, which will be a large fine and will threaten the company' s very existence.	1.3884882069195132
Mr President, being the last to speak gives me the privilege, Commissioner, of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total, and, I believe, justified, confidence in you at the helm of this boat. But we all want to be oarsmen on it.	1.4355926702749553
We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you.	0.9005895725069498
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform.	1.3689943768704842
The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories.	0.9933375550283534
Firstly, there is the concern that some have expressed, in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, President of the Committee on Economic Affairs, of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty.	1.621824316102292
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed.	1.1292985740736299
Secondly, we have the issue of companies' legal certainty.	1.4283725647086303
It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty.	1.2432030169133585
We all agree on this.	0.6353806935644672
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimising the nature of the internal market.	1.3643917907682208
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said.	1.2102850403522278
There have only been nine rejections.	0.5209917720033266
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer.	1.2066567885498471
How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project, in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante, changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules!	1.2312891973144515
This is therefore an aspect to be considered.	1.0898579493671101
Thirdly, we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law.	1.2088195783961737
In this respect, the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon.	1.1827926287948594
I believe that biodiversity is good, as is cultural diversity, but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market, that is to say, competition law.	1.4009647715089086
Here improvements should be made.	0.8130492894601652
Only in certain countries, Germany for example, is there specialised jurisdiction.	1.2579966796134148
Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore, but we must also explore others.	1.3212056110734145
What we cannot do, Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way, and give ammunition, to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good, of the rich, and not of the citizen, or the small and medium business, which, in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements, very late, with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call "le parcours du combatant", that is to say, after Lord knows how many years, when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement, a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment.	1.5386330689024843
Commissioner, it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform.	1.4252245864853814
It transcends competition, it transcends the cohesion of the internal market. I believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of European integration, the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration.	1.3947590247088426
Therefore, Commissioner, we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation.	1.3650526929016131
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects.	1.3104218735463355
In my opinion, Mr President, this joint debate fully bears this out.	1.1332626065794589
We have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order.	1.2603639384027105
Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy, a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction.	1.2088369248955948
The guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy, which we shall have the opportunity to address together, aims to ensure more effective protection of competition, reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the European people.	1.3534344936334015
I, personally, would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report.	1.2411498424418546
I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups. I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission, but, on the contrary, fundamental contributions, since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome.	1.3235855120543212
The groups are: the efficiency of the rules, the risk of renationalisation, consistent application of the rules and legal certainty. I will take these very quickly one at a time.	1.5695208962445522
Efficiency: I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it.	1.3086456787923335
The current notification instrument, ladies and gentlemen, no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that, in 35 years, there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which, in the majority of cases, receive a simple comfort letter.	1.3684824346982487
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals.	1.4217231336323841
The question of renationalisation: first of all, although it is not really necessary, I would like to point out and stress, several times if I may, that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that, as far as Regulation 17 is concerned, there is a risk of renationalisation.	1.487157487028982
Of course we have pondered this issue, and we are still studying it extremely carefully, and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced.	1.3836511188465683
At the end of the day, I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified.	1.3195176288026507
The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy.	1.237300491623185
The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission' s activities, but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers.	1.3671480108040832
The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term, used by Mrs Randzio-Plath, and, moreover, I fully agree with it - of European competition culture.	1.3981613105710484
So, the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive, and they are certainly not all the same.	1.4892337219305853
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned, permitting greater use of Community law, which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply.	1.121458157166407
Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation, not renationalisation, of competition law.	1.5809098114951747
The question of consistent application: the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind, but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated.	1.3222810148260158
As with many other provisions of the Treaty, Articles 81(1) and 82 have, after all, been applied for decades by national authorities and judges, and I do not feel that this has created serious problems.	1.3359144208266833
In a directly applicable exception system, consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules.	1.0527738336041066
The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework, both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice.	1.2446979078050902
Secondly, we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes, and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation.	1.4637640084749446
In this respect, I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and Mr Huhne of monitoring implementation.	1.1003467947350243
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation.	0.8732915469989055
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up.	1.3451015363512553
Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on, it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts.	1.3850558991506063
That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application.	1.251355835803157
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns, Mrs Peijs.	1.1005532433630196
Concerning Mr Evans' point regarding the implications for businesses, it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted.	1.2591690204089447
The purpose of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources.	1.2800890905350972
We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business.	1.1422309605218337
We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation.	1.2372586991267394
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. This was raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs.	1.400607197702593
Many speakers have underlined this.	0.6153362288154959
The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs.	1.1066087765283055
We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs.	1.0502081626201933
Why?	-0.0
Is this simply a political gesture?	0.654036381868384
No.	-0.0
In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations, as in the field of vertical restraints.	1.1949506752244372
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share.	1.3131519040417563
We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81(1).	1.0283288829396724
We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs, and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system, and secondly, by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which will benefit SMEs in particular.	1.3950932338662128
The fourth group is legal certainty.	0.6531449666478826
Mr Evans, legal certainty is, of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses, not just for the legal professions, although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe.	1.3583237222694091
Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a subject, the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market, including, in this case, competition.	1.3158076225452036
I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons: by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3), it will permit authorisation, without a prior decision, of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty.	1.301309829733171
(FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers.	1.271231888016095
Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982, as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof.	1.3199805280771308
The White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined: the exchange of confidential information.	1.0801165695353752
The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion.	0.9734539630776439
(IT) I shall now quickly turn, Mr President, to Mr Rapkay' s report, and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the Commission' s XXVIIIth Annual Report on Competition Policy.	1.4861264664797147
We share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully.	1.1513994350544767
I will mention only two, in order to be brief.	1.2331014445819581
The first is greater transparency.	1.1426282170071216
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy, as I did right from the moment I had my hearing, on 1 September, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.	1.5041289340723587
As regards the international aspect of competition policy, I can confirm, Mr Rapkay, that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has also drawn our attention. We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American, Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy, and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation.	1.3903707210322631
Mr Jonckheer, I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union.	1.0599804100584191
I will not talk about codecision here, but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important.	1.5011975735474392
It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion, and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.315419387256723
With regard to your suggestions, Mr Jonckheer, you already know that my staff, who, although short-handed as usual, are fortunately highly qualified, are working hard to produce the register of State aids and the State aids 'scoreboard' .	1.4450016593011998
I am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey, which, according to the scheduled timeframe, should be being drawn up by the staff now, in January, and for adoption by the Commission in March 2000, to see whether the latest trends are confirmed.	1.4274777043626028
Mr Jonckheer, Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid.	1.4755378600802198
I can only say very briefly, that we are actively working with them on a practical level: they are making preparations, they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities.	1.3923490664326055
I can also say, in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which, as you know, I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid.	1.54235430791425
In connection with the issue of State aid, I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, among others regarding repayment of illegal aid.	1.33116907948067
In April 1999, the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment.	1.1917135720872032
In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules.	1.379295022705349
Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report, which, although geared more towards a specific sector, is a valuable contribution.	1.4141171253354998
I would like to say that, as we know, the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure, pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector.	1.2864378967722196
In respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector, which will come into force in July 2002, we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied, and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this.	1.472296685053758
When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form, I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you.	1.344700925896528
So, Mr President, I will walk away from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament' s intellectual and political support, which appears to come from all sides of the House, for competition policy, its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future.	1.49010165709133
I am especially grateful for all of this.	1.004265506106334
We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, and, at a more general level, with Parliament.	1.45660329405723
In this regard, I liked your term, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: we must all pull together, preferably in the same direction.	1.357431029965397
Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration.	1.332545090511325
As Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate, at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept: it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy.	1.3423122703517274
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social, as well as economic, role in the European integration process, as it has done in the past.	1.4464523097778852
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.	1.1902230275283787
The joint debate is closed.	0.43141497917890276
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.1800861409464389
Protection under criminal law of the Union's financial interests	0.8593886444149195
The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, containing Parliament' s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.	1.083894541494596
Mr President, year after year we learn, mainly from the European Court of Auditors' test reports, that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage, mismanagement, and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud.	1.4148309556579446
For some time now, these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer' s money, which, when all is said and done, is what sustains the Union' s budget.	1.3194853259174173
Particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud, to detecting it, punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening.	1.2987511860503238
Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps, as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring.	1.3052286344979898
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed.	1.125614793087455
So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success.	1.1750214538328998
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures.	1.2093669279023973
Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States.	1.321095742831323
Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement.	1.293462150265861
What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this.	1.2964538185385106
For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States.	1.0865573436365206
After five years only four have done so.	0.6970776614880801
This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office.	1.246460000925847
There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity.	1.3077323408168406
We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised.	1.3525218633830536
The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process.	1.0208771979045432
We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals.	1.3601757915045587
In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established.	1.4012881547496636
I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment.	1.101000108350828
The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings.	0.7401687080504581
The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF.	1.4449686044915317
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency.	0.868796897776312
The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and to OLAF' s relationship with the national authorities.	1.2662287017651268
There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States.	0.9986977928361482
The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts.	1.1519371577306055
In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called corpus juris, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared.	1.3465504815368992
Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men.	1.0459453056724262
The Commission, Mr Barnier, Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea.	1.5521761767033864
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority.	1.3205867210045117
We can set another example here, to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular, fraud, and to mete out punishment where necessary.	1.4308999412251615
Mr President, I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato.	1.7566011764259526
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well, and the result, which we have received today, is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area.	1.60904222518645
This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4).	0.9205892708608143
If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand, least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought. The Treaty is a collection of complex articles.	1.4124352828773512
However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.	1.3026338201956953
At the same time, it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community' s financial interests, as Mrs Theato has explained very well.	1.1907708086967903
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful.	1.6605665994059815
As the French say, "ne jettons pas le bébé avec l'eau du bain" [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water], that is to say, in the protection of the Community' s financial interests, we must respect, on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizens, which affect the essential guarantees.	1.4484282035113345
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly.	0.8281717741230589
Therefore, in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission.	1.5153294236139048
Mr President, this, as Mrs Theato said, is a critical report.	1.7882329740688954
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report.	1.4239396848180652
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement. It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is.	1.3151402525886358
We need to do something about it.	1.2097317725349281
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget.	1.4958662215306602
A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done.	1.2945325655802289
We need to take this responsibility seriously.	1.493287611806526
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union.	1.0122224001705966
The question is: who prosecutes?	1.0126434170133787
That is where we really get into difficulty.	0.9905914407581794
Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers?	0.9693342558398136
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States.	1.1702661515898098
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one.	1.1811320430409384
We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people.	1.1987538407410114
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions.	1.3744924288223455
Of most importance to Parliament, as the guardian of the budget of the European Union, is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions.	1.4001559339161516
At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal.	1.2032255981311781
People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted, and that is not the case at the moment.	1.3211663029698337
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio.	1.4162310333251518
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question.	1.3308894308163317
We are aware that it is a delicate debate.	1.3399368960065796
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties.	1.278275889998286
Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here, no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor.	1.2990182149770813
But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable.	1.1463860390994252
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report.	0.9507988050134039
I think it is a first-class report which will, for the most part, be supported by my group.	1.412939457224836
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage.	1.0516389354093527
Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months, this could well be the case.	1.2508291996043226
We all know that, in 1995, it was agreed that the Union' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law.	1.4617672044727732
But the Member States failed to cooperate.	0.962216944924509
This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present, I think.	1.3207083541245352
It is now possible, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, that the Commission will take new initiatives, and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity.	1.3399096730298885
Unlike the previous speaker, who has now disappeared, my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor.	1.3705496210884613
My colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga, will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter.	1.1555312826397217
I think what we need is, at European level, to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible.	1.2731874291987864
I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic.	1.3346896811011255
One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong, especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union, then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another.	1.4877919759125768
This, I thought, is no longer permissible, certainly not at the moment.	1.5207386106129726
I would like to make one general point on politics. Whatever we may say about the European elections, the low turnout is a fact.	1.4067030087693464
We can improve on this by punishing crime in Europe quickly, and this must be done at European level.	1.3053419361350094
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur.	1.0916406804510836
Mrs Theato' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions.	0.9577465033665865
I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of, bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout.	1.439095699711107
Yet, every year we have the same problem.	1.4161277470272182
The Court of Auditors publishes its report, which criticises the Member States on account of various incidences of fraud.	1.3854087184888495
So far, however, the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here, to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied.	1.285221818284133
It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year.	0.9954033382067522
I believe that Mrs Theato' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here.	1.3329852374761355
It is important that after the first step, which has already been taken, i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF, in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework.	1.5160081789190167
We will need the European Public Prosecutor' s Office for this, which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees, also for suspects.	1.3953879565216023
Having said all that, I must say that unfortunately, my group will not be voting for your report as a united front.	1.3681128906375988
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people.	1.1891890155527545
Unfortunately, however, people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity.	1.3771552054833474
But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato' s report receives more support.	1.3328227526832301
Mr President, we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled, even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties, so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests can be guaranteed.	1.5399303645848597
The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea, but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system.	1.1528181373780353
Indeed, we are talking about criminal law, the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is, and will be, fierce.	1.4575112196613338
Indeed, it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system.	1.2549046295952087
Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are.	1.1155652264717004
In any case, this idea must be encouraged, and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties.	1.3267718259017145
On behalf of my group, but also personally, I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens' rights and guarantees, which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States.	1.461718080880703
Therefore, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda.	1.3027394582129515
Mr President, Mrs Theato' s report on the protection of the European Union' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor.	1.2149561440761758
This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state.	1.2608044381778538
But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters.	1.1143685342528842
Moreover, this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms.	1.310072856766523
According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor is needed, in particular, in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office, OLAF.	1.3462181427484035
At the same time, however, we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court.	1.3355486470956481
In this way, a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one, and a medium-sized one may hide a large one.	1.367523914640845
Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one, as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then, why not a European Minister of Justice, supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament?	1.4069413215526088
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform, which appears to be quite specific.	1.1844655077636406
In the final analysis, we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form, organised around a superstate.	1.1173292255851144
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on the other hand, wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network.	0.9297835715636195
And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities, for example, and the creation, if necessary, of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances.	1.3177484194826086
So the legal framework, Mr President, is already in place.	1.4302011604480254
It is fine, in principle.	1.1677510796649284
It need only be fine-tuned.	0.7246385279439264
Mr President, Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason.	1.2391120783842848
Public opinion, although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows, is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution: a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General.	1.2737547600285422
Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI, the European police, in the form of OLAF.	1.456027653679525
All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible.	1.3471178955604648
And indeed there is a twofold shift.	1.064524998521852
Firstly, the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift, a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomatic service, a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor.	1.5124868714411828
All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion, while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Generalised System of Preferences, free trade areas, customs presents to Chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource, GDP, as a result of the budgetary rationing pact.	1.0974248794483172
Next we have the Puritan shift: the Teutonic Europe of the North, the Europe of the Lutherans, Calvinists and Quakers, wishes to inflict its moral order on us.	1.208929242657764
Basically, the more we lose our grip on morals, the more we tighten our grip on our wallet.	1.3180275936544315
Mr President, it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union, more so these days than there used to be.	1.3358195613837973
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe' s citizens.	1.152773122414132
The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future.	1.0236314435920284
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law.	1.0999868282760554
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this.	0.9839824172493455
Now it is, of course, possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the Member States and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity.	1.1617573060143658
There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level.	1.253902330164766
When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda, it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage.	1.1755098575103293
Now that is not a contradiction, since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law, as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report, is actually about taking action in the EU' s own interests, which, as far as that goes, does not damage the legal interests of the Member States; on the contrary, it protects them, at least indirectly.	1.5375047699960092
The compatibility with the various national systems of law, as confirmed by experts, shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common, for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned.	1.4202723555033945
Taking these aspects into account, I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind, as proposed, and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF.	1.453187726840712
Mr President, will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving EU funds?	1.4302509648687287
I do not believe so.	1.2218329763540632
On the other hand, we can go a long way using the existing tools.	1.2630066124058146
An alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust, as proposed at the last Summit.	1.4420603622071448
In the way it is structured, Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes.	1.0731117849263927
It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for.	1.1150547039042233
OLAF, Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be used fully and, when the Fraud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States, we can also achieve a lot with this.	1.3639242268156646
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement.	1.3513938996377501
It is simply too bad, and I can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common European Public Prosecutor' s Office instead.	1.4389749196213664
However, it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office.	1.172183309476442
It is, after all, only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law. Ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence.	1.2273561032382634
Instead, there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily.	1.1263925240796675
We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and, especially, change our practice.	1.1359434711864302
At the moment, Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used.	1.107464185665839
Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions!	0.9439853374570697
Mr President, we all want to do something about combating European fraud.	1.5011026265290917
But the question is now: is the European Union doing anything about it as well?	1.4308385072947132
The answer to this is that we know very little about this.	1.22014567125379
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime.	0.7445760182375776
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but, in reality, we have made little progress.	1.4770984943914973
There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States, as was stated before, have not ratified the treaty texts submitted.	1.4313183949354844
So a great deal has to be done in this area.	1.3195849680614828
And what exactly should be done?	0.8278965424160364
Two things, and Mrs Theato' s report clearly spells these out.	1.2836817458720577
Firstly, the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union.	1.1072719992286282
So, unification in this small area.	0.8836497600169013
Secondly, we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor' s Office with two tasks, firstly to assist the national public prosecutors, helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and, secondly, to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision.	1.3157718389859054
The European Public Prosecutor' s Office is nothing to be afraid of.	1.033990388095465
I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on.	0.8817976413857153
It is, in fact, something very positive.	1.2698582318946723
Just like Europol. Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces.	1.2343266933045944
This is exactly the task which a small, limited, European Public Prosecutor' s Office should carry out, not just at the criminal investigation stage, but also at the prosecution stage.	1.2224059418377509
Parliament supports this.	0.41838318183523115
The Committee of Wise Men supports this.	0.8056354879726249
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same.	1.4745399309156246
Mr President, I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris.	1.0029087317136
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue.	0.9488938588870117
Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation.	1.0246901231249241
The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK.	1.027728313268586
The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about.	1.488802256752933
Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget.	1.069395930975963
But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists, with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity.	1.3659120096579949
We need a public debate on this.	1.356643224616219
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed.	1.4350915488600515
The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed.	1.0704156041865172
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date.	1.0516965331608852
It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate.	1.2820330611752295
Mr President, on behalf of the Italian Radical Members, I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control, because I share the concerns that have been voiced, in such an authoritative way, by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important: common law.	1.4995740246684823
With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue, since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed, to be crushed.	1.516819513565485
Nevertheless, the way in which our committee intends to see this text through, with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair, Mrs Theato, will not be without its critics.	1.4984671552163256
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law.	0.8850197790866489
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud.	1.1710154493503424
Nevertheless, we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality, without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this. That is to say, they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system.	1.2767153041713017
We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee.	0.9509216672950626
Mr President, we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament, during the plenary sittings and in the committees, even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture, the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed.	1.4056618750648218
We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events, which in the past seemed to be the norm.	1.3972036780860784
Today, something has changed, at least in terms of mechanisms, and especially as regards monitoring, but we are still not satisfied, particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor, crimes, fraud, the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one' s office at European level.	1.3998924902746794
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community' s interests, its image and its relationship with taxpayers, who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life.	1.3920619380617878
For this reason, it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests, and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States.	1.417451186210126
In this respect, we are faced with the most sensitive issue: what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems?	1.245687821760765
This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms.	0.859826005711078
Today, we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country.	1.0673039782158864
Mr President, I would very much just like to add to two particular points.	1.4069325359186506
Firstly, I would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States, although I am very much in favour of having such a debate, for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system.	1.2775088130993697
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion, but I digress.	1.1568026500391835
The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato' s report.	0.9461460548051913
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as European criminal offences - we have become embroiled in legalities.	1.5324270788396832
I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2.	0.9097282909722251
After all, there is no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor, rather, for legal reasons it has now become an independent, European authority, or "body" to quote Mrs Theato.	1.402330470147966
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis.	1.1320737896423756
We also face difficulties with regard to offences.	0.7175551078651176
Nothing has changed there.	0.5303462948810657
As has always been the case, there are offences that transcend European offences, as it were, or at least there is the potential for them to do so, and these might include money-laundering, receiving stolen goods, and forming a criminal organisation.	1.3471026710080813
As far as that is concerned, I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome.	1.343772543168313
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs.	1.3424697563330343
Mr President, for years, Parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.	1.3286036211269792
Frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention (and of the protocols relating to this protection) which, five years after being signed, has still not been ratified and has still not come into force.	1.2383943953372036
On the other hand, more pro-active attempts, such as OLAF, which is currently operating, have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights.	1.3451326437926092
The proposals in Mrs Theato' s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection, under criminal law, of our financial interests, which would criminalise certain activity, specifically fraud against the Community budget. These proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community.	1.479783852222503
At the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by OLAF, without harming the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice.	1.2637710927442647
Finally, following on from what was agreed in Tampere, the report restates the need for a European Public Prosecutor. This issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino' s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role, which everyone considers vital.	1.6592695179988626
We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions, by protecting the Union' s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community' s economic life.	1.1497411404943967
Nevertheless, it raises some very basic questions.	1.425950311213084
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying, in legal terms, the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which, although it might be called subsidiary, will always clash with the practice, and in certain areas, with the traditional, separate criminal law of the Member States?	1.5273811508625879
As there are doubts, would it not be more advisable, from a political point of view, to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda, and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor?	1.5399244466972277
Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom, security and justice?	1.0910914726662593
Mr President, the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny.	1.4369801956607071
Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged.	1.3624208846802128
To remedy this, vigorous efforts are required.	0.8531376762361929
We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently.	1.0608001750899585
At the same time, we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way.	1.4402960697460192
It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States.	1.2505050114498837
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework.	1.1888017478970296
On the other hand, I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime.	1.2530158276170003
In the present situation, I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor, which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty.	1.5662836762180816
We have more confidence in Eurojust, where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate.	1.092690606973054
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered.	1.289943774771147
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is, however, to find the right mix.	1.6062932896606181
The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which, through an exaggerated supervision of detail, prevents the development of a modern administration.	1.137530454730128
We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten' s report.	0.8760083935397375
The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision.	1.018872077235985
Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness, decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision.	0.9444243675719339
The major challenge is, therefore, to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law.	1.0772205096585459
This requires staff training, more modern recruitment methods and, above all, openness and public control.	1.0686116693435888
Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities.	0.9961868619682466
Mr President, rapporteur, restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us.	1.4540219333784417
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this.	1.176438276574303
Parliament is committed to this task, which is something this report bears impressive witness to.	1.1665491109345645
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do, in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change, to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union.	1.3665708756573416
On ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, all Member States stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment.	1.1568648561183854
Yet as things stand, only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995.	1.110363928504336
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation	1.3923435250533198
A legislative act, a directive, in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility, and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective, may enable us to take a major step forwards, and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste.	1.4686303652415649
OLAF, the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud.	1.393362848729596
Accordingly, the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks, the ECB and the EIB, contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations, citing their independent status.	1.2843666654018069
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting, and I hope that Parliament approves this step.	1.207691448230382
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions.	1.1411765784292005
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF, which was set up at the same time as OLAF, to safeguard the independence of OLAF, however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF.	1.4903470630928892
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point.	1.330144707316653
In other words, there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on.	1.2128142614764237
There is one thing I would ask though: I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority.	1.3702444264291158
No, there must be no undermining of OLAF' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur' s intention.	1.5387462414653263
As such, I would ask you to give OLAF' s work your full support, also in its present form.	1.2771894317110506
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	0.888918349451551

Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE).	1.093270555319466
Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4). These are both about voting.	1.391772015952237
Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes, the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then, if there is some doubt, should we utilise the electronic voting system?	1.3716021513619492
That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call.	1.328959167047453
You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it.	1.092942637472853
In this particular case, I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on.	1.8513480335829822
Mr President, I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general.	1.1966631786499593
It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands, so to speak, but go straight to the electronic voting system.	1.1822303497094568
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure.	1.317558789034969
I know it takes longer, but should we not always have a show of hands first?	1.3627505665846804
Mr President, as far as the second reading is concerned, the Commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by Parliament.	1.548144658714332
The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it.	0.6607366614936414

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Own resources	0.6602713213237225
. (FR) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources.	1.1089338744584882
The European budget is effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP, especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy, which had already been cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences.	1.2392991393419546
Since then, Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP, the taxable basis for the fourth resource, have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources.	1.1616719106322535
Since then, of course, this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is, but which it refuses to see itself as.	1.2624945204270048
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us.	1.0822590296890189
It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources, the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission.	1.1318770293635163
Furthermore, the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States.	1.2383621762927595
This is a long way from offshoots such as the "Community criminal code" , the "European Public Prosecutor" or a European police force, with OLAF.	1.5134050327051807
There is as yet no federal European tax.	0.7393299128616673
All the same, a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income, if not on profits, or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025.	1.3822245635172477
Koch Report (A5-0105/1999)	0.6316277194993678
- (FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods.	0.8077892727368592
In recent years, the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably, increasing the risk of accidents.	1.0751838511564595
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation.	1.0354483037710642
It therefore proved necessary, in the context of establishing the internal market, to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention.	1.2934304776891936
Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement.	0.8265415499361839
Firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged, quite rightly, to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention, whether road, rail or inland waterway transport is involved.	1.1906519810040144
In order to facilitate achieving this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training.	1.0391303118405892
This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation, regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport.	0.9597426329745952
While this represented significant progress at the time, the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem.	1.0834871467117955
It therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised, high-level training of safety advisers, but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training, with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different Member Sates.	1.3935816112514334
The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised.	1.1467519977398188
It outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies.	1.0425348254955473
Parliament voted in favour of this text.	1.0296669615151703
It did, however, table a number of amendments, most of which were adopted in the Council' s common position, particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the 'specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body' .	1.2205820769436075
In order to be realistic, I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force.	1.3396991063523138
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users, to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods.	1.151078645584013
Koch Report (A5-0104/1999)	0.5240917321341778
Last October I expressed my views on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail.	0.9388466897226849
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then.	0.844485458126361
Essentially, my opinion is as follows: I deplore the fact that, in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods, we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment.	1.3895556585743027
I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997.	1.0470249525869604
This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999.	0.8601219046904682
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations.	1.775287149089745
In line with the usual procedure, it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which puts forward standards in this area, and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR), applicable throughout Europe, whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU.	1.2626081692195248
The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted.	1.101165990584804
Consequently, the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems, rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements, as should have been the case!	1.5102537328513146
This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail, except for the fact that a time limit had been decided.	1.2626269099417349
Right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals.	1.2079569011682212
Until then, there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations.	1.2700477706622242
The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted, and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards.	1.0691629690424131
They may, therefore, continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation, where there are no applicable European standards.	1.1324885268494005
They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation.	0.8745727029390367
In offering this explanation of my vote, therefore, I wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern.	1.175706133774226
Schroedter Report (A5-0108/1999)	0.5720112283638856
Mr President, I wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development.	1.0614787095136098
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe.	1.3752596401433785
Not only the difference in income per capita but, above all, large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern.	1.0714061382565587
Despite the fact that the Community, through the structural funds among others, injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe, these disparities continue to exist.	1.2044353344122531
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and, based on very strict evaluations, change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively.	1.1561556104838044
Mr President, in relation to the Schroedter report, I am aware, and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier, that the rules on additionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-governing regions such as Wales or Scotland.	1.4134958876379076
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.	0.9508770643147986
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time.	1.256665867456414
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report, I have this important reservation.	1.4214362574986916
- The Schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000-2006.	1.1821931059854587
I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always spent in a manner which maximises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds.	1.1364240579330511
As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster, I have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national EU funds.	1.2857902255974025
I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities.	1.3134810895162288
I believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of European Structural Funds.	1.133226557309126
For example, we have seen the success of the Leader I and Leader II schemes in Ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of Ireland and within Europe.	1.4159571000773636
The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year.	1.0108774838868715
The Leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public, private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas.	1.1243512203331507
This is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit.	1.2182884275901027
The European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in Ireland.	1.049300835659524
Once again, there is active participation from groups from the private, public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region.	1.1373894922832626
During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006, other EU initiatives such as "Equal" and "Urban" will be operating.	1.0488994562435052
These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent.	1.0043387446836551
The rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes.	0.9592273544492282
They must promote a decentralised, efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities.	1.0337829054847358
This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national, European and local funding.	1.1978213829545739
.	-0.0
(FR) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy.	1.2513466781504528
In order to reduce disparities between regions, of course.	1.1293004275171203
But more especially because, even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy, it may also be a source of inequality.	1.3125183218144758
Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities.	1.1205252753490436
It is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model, which we are all in favour of, and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion.	1.370416225400881
This is a real political objective, alongside economic and monetary affairs, drawn up in collaboration with Member States, regions and local communities, with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming.	1.3555167915790614
This is why I shall support this report, despite regretting the fact that, for timetabling reasons, the European Parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist Member States, regions and local communities in the programming of Objectives 1, 2 and 3.	1.3394484740043888
Moreover, I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.	1.2490167408290782
Mrs Schroedter' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid.	0.9811550685312456
It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved, chiefly those involved at a local level, who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems, hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships, which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned.	1.254991925811809
This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid.	1.177206564062214
In order to do so, the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament, associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society.	1.228063982577341
These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid.	0.866553383084111
Amended again as such by the Schroedter report, they are a step in the right direction.	0.9471753528718788
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006, but that is another subject.	1.4297119659100945
In the meantime, let us support this first step.	1.0942110438046493
- This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States.	1.0234432619064435
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim, I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether.	1.207028403281651
In my mind, illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping.	0.898987452270757
We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry, we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments.	1.0423026547633945
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans, then we must have a level playing field.	1.190168796961936
Illegal state aid, by contrast, destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment.	0.9554825268510668
There are, of course, cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate, for example helping companies restructure.	1.1745322648588972
In all such cases, however, strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained.	1.3044983213676868
Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry, EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law.	1.0705388379474468
I enthusiastically support the report's proposal to publish a "scoreboard" showing the amount of state aid per Member State.	0.8699260636172679
Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed.	0.9976178843297713
Member States cannot be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private.	0.9671992083696165
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling.	1.0367250525369571
Much remains to be done, however, and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe.	1.3306243213993885
.	-0.0
(PT) The Commission' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity, given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States.	1.360883093696914
Unfortunately, the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight.	1.3589275567582124
It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions, of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples. This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion.	1.4523526037462657
The truth is though, that the Commission' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives.	1.2718391671294607
On the other hand, it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity, and supporting the social economy and solidarity. There must also be support for rural development, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas, specifically in the field of social housing, with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	1.2728816302085297
.	-0.0
(IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy' s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined.	1.4480081461262762
In the first place, if administrative procedures are not simplified, it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform, with a view to greater efficiency and concentration.	1.2476006718937316
In this respect, the Commission document has shortcomings, as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities, and for their funding, execution and monitoring.	1.5416112547986318
SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.	1.2468224138239195
A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time.	1.1240058734551608
In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report), the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact, it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States, and it published the guidelines back in July 1999, even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties, thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines.	1.3676674730606968
This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance.	1.2107901241128671
In general, the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent.	1.1947415482194543
They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries.	1.2106858980736175
That said, the differing approach adopted in the guidelines, which are not geared to geographical objectives, but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive.	1.4929916616282586
While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions, we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows, in practice, a policy of integrated interventions, for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary.	1.3930812430347463
We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention.	1.2299594497457262
The guidelines, as adopted by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance, they are providing a shopping list of possible measures, a shopping list which, as it fails to set priorities in ascending order, could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration.	1.4215511169023023
We could say that, in this state of affairs, we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and, hence the destruction of the countryside.	1.2619578827645073
There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument, which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and, moreover, would accord proper status to local bodies which, being independent, could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly, and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency, concentration and administrative reform.	1.4379303334887699
Rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in, by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration.	1.3505496130533816
It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal, rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs, which are no longer solely connected with agriculture, in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also, for instance, in rural tourism, sport and cultural activities, environmental projects, SMEs, services, and so on.	1.520809435934078
A genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy. The fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need "guidelines".	1.2584145040054504
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities.	1.2821248729531545
In conclusion, the document is not particularly satisfactory, and in some aspects is disappointing.	1.6043991233019497
Berend Report (A5-0107/1999)	0.6269536417097621
. (PT) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union.	1.0472284425744052
We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues.	0.9130536921229442
Firstly, and as the Commission itself states, it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards.	1.391715722090906
This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union' s per capita GDP level.	1.1383209201833862
We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area.	1.3208364324975355
This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes.	1.2780956396875818
Finally, but no less importantly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur' s proposal that, in future, this type of report should also include, amongst other issues, an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State.	1.5956303987887632
The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue. This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State.	1.2664360260506489
. (FR) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment, the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration.	1.4362907190224532
As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today.	1.095087508283466
The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries.	1.1388032854796204
This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996.	1.3919268463202532
It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened.	0.9777658789263202
It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration.	1.2443157773043343
Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained.	1.2046318566183962
.	-0.0
(PT) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy, the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion. Issues of mergers and state aid however, still remain within the notification system.	1.4407693942786457
The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy, moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice, and even aims at having specialised courts.	1.2181234243503265
This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States.	0.8221843134061186
On the other hand, as the rapporteur points out, in the name of competition policy, public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies, with the privatisation of important industries and public companies, as has happened in Portugal, with harmful consequences for the country and its workers.	1.4204338099690774
- (FR) The Commission' s White Paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (now 81 and 82) certainly does not propose any "renationalisation" of competition policy, as some Members of the European Parliament fear.	1.1317841193488398
But it does, at least, make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union.	1.0970207460749757
In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.	1.2563171375265763
The most remarkable thing, in my view, is the message conveyed by this proposal: that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily, and virtually automatically, requires reform of the centralised system.	1.372905002859138
Admittedly, this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling.	1.4108009979602998
Indeed, the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system.	1.3890518731990058
Moreover, the von Wogau report, which the European Parliament has just voted on, supports it in so doing.	1.5854138563573397
But at the same time, one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended.	1.0537716084832995
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term.	1.2004534631744976
Is this not, indeed, what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament?	1.3543942912769626
The German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because, in their view, it might break up European policy on competition, which is to say, in plain terms, attacking the standardising superstate.	1.3749088380800547
Curiously, a number of employers agreed with them, preferring the European "one-stop" system, which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally.	1.2511937223832106
Indeed, this is one advantage of the present system.	1.7438386376336628
But, on the other hand, the wider view must also be taken, namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may, in the long term, lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account, and this will be of benefit to everyone.	1.3357000095480551
Rapkay Report (A5-0078/1999)	0.6807567753512037
The Members of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvrière Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy.	1.1113399839995803
Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other, which constantly takes the form of layoffs, factory closures, not to mention extensive waste of production capacity.	1.2202113384409912
We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power.	1.0641806684599693
Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union, despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world: these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote.	1.4374562606921173
The Commission' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridiculous, for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements.	1.2964631935003985
This is repulsive most of all in social terms.	1.0418156739238784
The European Commission' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes.	1.220450982389028
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still!	1.234040296206777
We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions, and still less of improving them.	1.3675988326122153
- (FR) In voting against this report, we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic.	1.1644431660606367
We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services, in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster, killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations.	1.3409120922862034
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century.	1.2536283365656593
Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere, culture or cooperation with the third world, excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity.	1.3586093539556496
Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy?	1.047540290464643
We are convinced that the opposite is true, and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive.	1.3212797666694507
Excessive in comparison with what iron rule, what criteria of efficiency?	1.1077495103052795
Finally, after Seattle, do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO?	1.3799520731504782
Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness.	0.7228851403991468
Jonckheer Report (A5-0087/1999)	0.6822606490422285
I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU, and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report, and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information, both general and specific, publicly accessible via its website.	1.4649234086874519
I am happy with the rapporteur' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this.	1.282999489407727
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition.	0.9231094679167278
Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union.	1.2789582834101345
However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158).	1.4632935256228634
Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission.	1.3613234645786443
The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997, including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector.	1.1246262274571306
This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector).	1.1105728996548092
This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder.	1.127578644339301
Like the rapporteur, I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid.	1.2684540938309394
The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible.	1.0701181830729063
It must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time, which is to say in time for the ninth report.	1.4104885277601305
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State.	1.0092215941096738
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid.	1.1775284922397917
In order to compensate for this situation, the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us.	1.231947296704519
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous: the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another, with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU.	1.151505204919496
This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment, industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries.	1.1724249146422927
Langen Report (A5-0073/1999)	0.6828130925084988
In the important debate on competition this morning, I expressed my views on Mr Langen' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	1.080455853282104
Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996, the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation.	1.0663731206546285
Establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable, even though Article 4(c), of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry.	1.250999502495887
This, indeed, is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	1.0852138185681965
At the same time, it is, of course, essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	1.0286003523520897
It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development, environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure.	1.2041855383695204
In the same way, it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings, as stipulated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code.	1.332922908991417
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or, at least, annually, without the need for reminders.	1.2239105516454187
Like the rapporteur, I am pleased with the Commission report, but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid.	1.5096221286449463
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code.	1.1647053053753293
In the interests of equality, there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment.	1.0660695021248805
Finally, we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.	1.145881553838252
The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002.	0.7954232677685367
My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code.	1.16954586430082
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report, and I now await the Commission' s response to our requests and demands.	1.3578875327575843
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	0.5013524807864441
Oil slick off the French coast	0.16810415800312137
The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast.	0.89384652285593
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission.	1.1367204665523543
Mr President, I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but also as an elected representative for Brittany, and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events.	1.408100761692173
Together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group, we tabled a motion for a resolution.	1.0216309646155703
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion.	1.279811667615183
The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue, firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, with extremely serious consequences for tourism, people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists, and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale.	1.352637555868264
A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline, and why?	1.1762123475102784
Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard.	1.4683817650699669
If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred.	1.5435739405605977
This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability.	1.5056371016465535
Well, if the charterer is exonerated, then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for.	1.3221697752547361
The regulations must therefore be reviewed, and I thank you, Commissioner, for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations.	1.285069596064989
Moreover, as you said, monitoring must above all be stepped up: that of the flag state, that of the classification societies.	1.3766178788767875
You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission.	0.8183848598160333
What are the conditions for this recognition?	1.1002635552311275
What guarantees are there of its reliability?	0.7178674489447654
You are going to commission a fact-finding mission.	0.7042858475851553
We await the outcome with great interest.	0.7614546130907699
Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up.	0.9357436776517682
There is a Paris Memorandum in existence, let me remind you, which stipulates a minimum for inspection, that is, one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned.	1.3163240949798785
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries.	1.0339087633561888
Why not?	-0.0
What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw?	0.9707649983583014
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for, in this case, the oil company.	1.2756928649701056
If the charterer' s liability entails a financial commitment, then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent.	1.1971617879641225
Finally, we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States.	1.2290869610269195
Firstly, I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team.	1.1249785714162117
This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area.	1.082767793384054
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster.	1.213921930779542
I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes.	1.111494380240571
Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year.	1.3468380214010272
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it?	1.2287791809590065
How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds?	0.920552087275023
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which, as our resolution points out, causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster?	1.114467527654831
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards, we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed'.	1.1309939172569656
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively.	1.189449174640859
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety.	1.287245826639362
The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods. Just as the Sea Empress, just as the Braer did.	1.1135566606718896
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster.	1.0865292686517631
My group's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster, just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions.	1.1201064860952055
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea.	1.1000831865858949
The time for resolutions has passed.	0.8696327274544328
What is now needed is action.	0.7669885383255425
Sadly, I fear, the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster.	1.6275840375970705
Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again.	1.5032687975183674
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future.	1.096525222267645
The "Erika" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected, but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe.	1.1864471552695628
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe.	1.1847152898967765
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds, perhaps mainly guillemots, may have died.	1.1059425860595693
The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic.	1.010390556205179
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying.	1.0541322663143344
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the "polluter pays" principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced.	1.0746004796567923
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks, but the question is, how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes?	1.486848590836487
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice.	1.3781831999368273
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully.	1.0624595227304738
Mr President, Commissioner, I have brought you a small gift. Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows: "With every tide, the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika.	1.1905308276407787
With every tide, the volunteers, members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick, sticky, black tar.	0.903636198254334
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?"	1.1254752995928095
Indeed this disaster involving the Erika, like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey, moreover, is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available.	1.2357491108268814
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, despite our saying at the time and many times since, "Never again!"	1.2481062413165367
It is, of course, the responsibility of policies, and therefore our responsibility, to guarantee the safety of sea transport.	1.311900599624876
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again.	1.1178513043270124
But, listening to you, Commissioner, we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992, I believe, the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee.	1.362071078346691
Indeed, we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many.	1.3363357281705914
This is why it is essential, as a matter of urgency, for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes.	1.2891139873514605
We should be aware, for example, that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil.	1.2062971431027958
Why, in these circumstances, is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised?	1.3443767501882795
Your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance, at last, of the ban on degassing at sea.	1.1680777833965037
A European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently.	0.9408826528936299
In addition, it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO, as a matter of urgency.	1.4675628924928006
What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if, once they are at sea, most vessels do just what they wish?	1.2072715889215604
Finally, a compassionate thought for all the volunteers, nature lovers and bird lovers, who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds, organising rescue operation with the means available.	1.1974812877894745
I can testify to this remarkable work.	0.584657069626099
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick, which is a major ecological disaster, practically unprecedented in scale.	1.2494602487121573
In relation to this, you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces.	1.1419305673886384
And, on this subject, Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats.	1.2968300752009965
Once again, there will be no clearly defined party responsible.	0.9895754501568828
In the meantime, it is nature that is taking the rap, as always.	1.4556197334373346
Mr President, my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster, affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment.	1.2587609384857945
Let me, in this connection, welcome the presence in the visitors' gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque, spokesperson for the oil slick action group "Marée noire" , made up of men and women from the French department of Morbihan.	1.1732571865701007
Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field.	1.2718146128630858
As the European Parliament, we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and, at the same time, demanding tightening up of the quality criteria, on the European and international scale, of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport, stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders.	1.36391607073706
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers.	0.9583260347561908
Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year, 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more.	1.096818452788245
This is no longer tolerable.	0.47655926074014965
Next, we have flags of convenience.	1.3481498936847933
According to the International Transport Federation, over 40% of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience, the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety.	1.252163242585965
This is no longer tolerable.	0.47655926074014965
Finally, there is the lack of transparency.	1.3959981361256044
Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility, the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible.	1.1937010707015345
This is no longer tolerable.	0.47655926074014965
In all these respects we must ensure real, significant change, including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards, including the mandatory double hull, on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States.	1.30853313761205
We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels.	0.9327935775040532
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused.	1.1097742782277389
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance.	1.2312684773833313
This is an approach, Mr President, which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation.	1.778288904912827
In so doing, it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which, in this instance, is awaiting clear, tangible action.	1.4061160446215055
Mr President, Commissioner, as a Member for the French Atlantic coast, for Vendée, I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters, caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us, but by a crime.	1.4187554307802666
In this emergency, in this ordeal, we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity, national solidarity, and intergovernmental solidarity.	1.4970210616006339
What the stricken populations are waiting for now, those who have lost everything, particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism, those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come, is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused, but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future.	1.2394856190296228
Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.	1.195742490907521
Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals.	1.2293223803352475
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies.	0.854234048241599
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion.	1.034372751376204
Obviously, such matters should be handled at world level, but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose, and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter, despite previous disasters.	1.4208041366134678
Admittedly, there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, IOPCF, but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level, which must be reviewed.	1.3498196349202216
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO.	1.0003432500389862
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this.	1.3978469414938146
Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience, that of a state applying for membership of the European Union.	1.1306955237569372
In addition, there are Community directives, but they are seldom applied, if at all, due to the insufficient number of national inspectors.	1.330371173992522
This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency.	0.7479146223718636
A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but it is making very slow progress.	1.1995675938646733
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings.	1.0481639129721736
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July.	1.4394487512768732
This must be brought forward.	1.024199875291949
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict.	1.1467815761274047
I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities.	0.8250099043907636
Firstly, the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally.	1.143484983379817
The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil, criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select.	1.2442182588189725
Secondly, the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely.	1.1549482674592633
Thirdly, a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future.	1.273085291308563
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age.	0.8673773366870453
If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear, strict and trenchant, then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory, in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters.	1.2376953615222888
Thus, the Erika was refused access to American waters.	1.2261098163392987
If the European Community had done the same, a great disaster would have been avoided.	1.4647175708942926
Let us ensure, Mr President, Commissioner, that this time we really do learn the lesson, even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down.	1.2994546712379342
Mr President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic Bravery, Haven, Amoco Cadiz, Gino, Tanio, so many names we remember with horror.	1.1273942778848132
And now the Erika.	0.5392294455103697
Whose turn is next?	0.4413824622606393
Twenty one years after Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth oil slick, the seventh since 1967, shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers.	1.2130093507853545
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react, for their capitulation to the multinationals.	1.0406722121054892
It is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept, and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety.	1.2734946085636476
And this is the result.	1.638526723968214
The Erika, a vessel flying a Maltese flag, a floating rust bucket, classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers, has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline, a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz.	1.1781633479368272
As an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region, unfortunately, I can testify to this.	1.1461885709726223
There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters, they are the result of fate.	1.1208659625935726
They are the result of human thoughtlessness.	0.9075016255961581
What we have here is an ecological disaster.	1.2239799575248
Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that.	0.9141850032731101
It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, people who make a living from the salt marshes, shopkeepers, etc.	1.078153182647572
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series.	1.1570466626787583
First of all, we must shed some light on this shipwreck.	1.191907192635514
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission?	1.155093128087537
Next, as a matter of urgency, we muss pass legislation, firstly, regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported.	1.3444091192589236
In fact, according to the experts, the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast.	1.1399784383059666
We know what actually happened.	0.8134215048568733
Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old.	1.0385410334732148
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea.	1.0400631718676874
This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium.	1.4491456614035356
Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the "polluter pays" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate "natural disasters" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds.	1.1947424636545994
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group.	1.3379470728009264
Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning.	1.1701711989725816
It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time.	1.3299968096144867
We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice.	1.1922936784040825
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things.	1.26871500894668
No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances.	1.2948667846441078
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation.	1.2428337405774637
However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that.	1.4372908388302696
In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system.	1.2017410252000544
Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response.	1.3632844026541022
Many thanks for this.	0.5103239095963555
This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today.	1.1893830654462927
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best.	1.1010687642078403
The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money.	1.0750122200925443
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members.	0.8870689373573794
During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more.	1.4220691741840399
What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision.	1.25968598065844
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner?	1.028209322075812
First of all, the port-state control, according to which 25% of all ships require inspection.	1.1603562168374206
I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place. So this 25% should be increased.	1.4263977833018824
Furthermore, if a ship is no longer seaworthy, not only should the facts be examined, but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used.	1.521604425267783
But this is not in place.	1.2958867993445389
Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area.	1.3548011733188985
Finally, as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned, some Members have already mentioned just now that, since 1999 in the United States, ships should in any case be double-hulled.	1.5310230234091797
In my opinion, we should look further into this point, and I also think that the Marpol Treaty, which comes into effect in 2001, should be looked at very closely.	1.456934140412621
Mr President, I would like to take a brief, critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to, and admiration for, the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals.	1.3132980596549801
Mr President, we have already had this discussion so many times in the past.	1.3843920454083851
We have achieved nothing so far, and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union.	1.300252325391168
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today, and what the Commissioner has announced here, actually leads to legislation being produced; in other words, if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers: "you must push this through in the Council of Ministers" .	1.4462575882255801
Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe, which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods.	1.305789924660483
So what are we to do now?	0.6732554083516371
I have no intention of talking about past events; rather I want to look to the future.	1.3163466205449244
What are we to do now?	0.5714061054132
I will tell you a few things we should do.	1.1677426851250627
Of course, we need double-hulled vessels.	1.40473583953513
That goes without saying, but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term.	1.267114551389715
So what do we need to happen immediately?	1.2745190648672315
We need technical testing of ships, that is obligatory technical testing every two years, and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate.	1.248596071128188
We need this at European level and internationally; we need something like a TÜV, an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany, which is compulsory every two years.	1.3335707760452393
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle.	1.1585563136953894
This is what we need for ships.	1.1464174207494864
Thirdly, we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports, that is in every port of the European Union.	1.3744564726822355
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port, regardless of all the port charges.	1.076960275531495
We must reach agreement here, in all the European Union' s ports, from Marseilles, through to Rotterdam, to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, and wherever ships drop anchor.	1.5500965484659772
Fourthly, we need the shipowner to bear liability, and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million, but to the value of at least USD 400 million, to be covered per insurance certificate.	1.4872281656843516
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability.	1.0137773997659514
We need to be sure that if need be, the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability.	1.1112397758782158
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision!	1.0154846274485776
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability.	0.9365442370705305
In the fifth place, we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union, and incidentally, that includes the candidate countries.	1.4461357371955765
Last but not least, we need a long memory, for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future.	1.3801349807433014
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme.	1.0367574918052707
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports.	1.1238966743311456
The unions will have something to say as will industry.	0.9592947987888469
A long memory will serve us well, ladies and gentlemen.	1.0812676982564147
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement.	1.1303316487937913
Just you go home and say: " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date" .	1.2583094744396748
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports.	1.2114833312121758
We need to have a long memory when we say: " for once we are united, at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned, and will not play one off against the other in the European Union."	1.4969057097711118
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years' time!	1.1265075887531575
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts.	1.31029449102573
We have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures.	0.9881089360509793
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led?	1.1688266929169784
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation' s introduction of the Plimsoll line, a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels.	1.1359996086675015
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had?	0.790448757685635
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about, the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion.	1.1517195527330675
We must also critically examine the classification societies.	0.9434280099945238
I do not think that we can accept their procedures.	1.4002588126616382
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control.	0.6970746612516507
Finally, I want to say that, when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment, there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards.	1.2840781670091728
Within the Commission, the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.	1.8846237205790561
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment, which are in keeping with the Commission' s guidelines, cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards.	1.4429679886284603
Mr President, we shall vote in favour of the GUE/NGL Group resolution because it denounces Total-Fina' s responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of superannuated vessels should be prohibited, or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil tankers.	1.2039453444554153
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick.	1.1448719901553486
How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations, and indeed many others who, in order to make more profit, take the risk of making the world uninhabitable?	1.2920586174590547
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality, without governments reacting?	1.1624346003289725
The crux of the problem is that all governments, and indeed all the European institutions, acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment.	1.2722706720888866
They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks, even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions.	1.0376653563230365
In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage.	1.0414408443512848
Mr President, I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies.	1.0193378830017619
However, we must stick to the facts.	1.437051585454527
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years.	1.0458161674034863
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken.	0.88145912946216
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls.	1.4521613430273193
I cannot accept this.	0.7074574797182868
If the Member States decide, in agreement with ourselves, that 25% of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control, then they must also make the necessary personnel available.	1.5187184501402768
The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing, rather there must be materials testing, for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue.	1.277204156689519
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous.	0.7767139995860893
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial, but include materials testing.	1.2753219019964546
Secondly, I also share the Commissioner' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path.	1.4404065140284208
If it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies.	1.0165752924795093
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit.	1.1347732552302654
Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we already have a TÜV (organisation for safety testing) for ships in the form of the classification companies.	1.2581211333699394
There are reputable companies too.	0.5042939076072783
You will be familiar with some reputable companies, our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable companies, but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements, and these must be struck off the list.	1.117451274425472
Finally, we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements, for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up!	1.4178399660055634
Mr President, Commissioner, the Erika sank near my home and is still there, with 20 000 tonnes in its hold, the fate of which we are waiting to discover.	1.377425249658853
It could have sunk anywhere.	0.6916381144954777
It happened to sink there, and Brittany, where I come from, should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula, and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks.	1.3412125451365198
My first thoughts are for the 26 Indian sailors, who were saved but of whom nothing has been said.	1.1307718277471237
There could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means, above all, men' s lives.	1.037721996522871
By now they are far away.	0.8087387333209511
It is a miracle that they were saved.	1.3811334685338617
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast.	1.241569276649193
Things could well continue in the same way.	0.7583320005968416
Commissioner, as time is very short, I would like to pick out the seven points which we feel, and you have already mentioned some of them, are essential to work on: double-hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports. In particular, we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public, as currently, we do not have access to them.	1.5158755640679584
Then, sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States; they should not be different, but the same throughout the Union.	1.2770728767879906
We must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience, not because they are necessarily bad boats, but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones.	1.4025926510773297
We must improve information on all of the world' s ships, but provision has already been made for this. We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them.	1.5194193889664482
With regard to this matter, I would like to know who owns the Erika, because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing, but there are always real shareholders in the background. Where are the Erika' s owners?	1.3786140801340996
Perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches, getting a nice tan.	0.8480637649135121
We would like to know their names and their faces.	1.1555007557468813
Finally, there must be improvements in the training of crews.	1.3647841699952394
In our society there is no such thing as zero-risk, but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety.	1.3737187832947453
Mr President, I welcome the statement from the Commissioner.	1.1368140241018994
Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea's power and destructive force, which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential.	1.1398486103944512
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika.	1.0578260215283277
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources.	1.1945472166447526
It should be noted that the oil industry, through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol, for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident, or some USD 170 million.	1.2105206009918392
This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners, to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility.	1.2965762857599765
However, before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations, let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented.	1.313328308444727
Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals.	0.8057904276771954
In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection.	0.9901484219284183
I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions.	0.9691687991019698
Calls for design improvements in hull construction, especially double-hulled vessels, are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet.	1.2623570286824015
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection.	0.7435241235392641
Mr President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, mainly in the committees on transport and the environment, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.	1.381498266713723
Because, as well as the irreparable damage to the environment, the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry, the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry, to the conservation of marine resources, and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover.	1.324562665689504
It is no accident, Commissioner, that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed, those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which, in the majority of cases, do not have any other resources.	1.3123379838115294
These are the same areas, Commissioner, which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts, without any control whatsoever.	1.343095986193228
I come from a region, Galicia, which has suffered similar accidents in the past.	1.271084784204291
Brittany and Galicia, two European 'Lands Ends' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks.	1.0145293988547395
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways.	1.0236176502234253
On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fishing industry, to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected, and also by asking them to demand, of international bodies and of themselves, tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience.	1.3236170079249303
In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag.	1.2952890342208299
On the other hand, prevention is essential.	0.780148183352467
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea.	1.0504756135889506
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal - technological, structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.	1.2801524980305796
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, who reminded me of old times when, as the then Mayoress, I lived through similar situations.	1.2890758812458616
We must thank those who, while defenceless and lacking in resources, have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks.	1.2330207729863125
Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, for her reaction to this incident, which has really shaken the whole of Europe.	1.3116891494410956
We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication.	1.4802735105635856
In addition, I should like to make a number of comments:	1.092519914277733
First, the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA, the Italian shipping register, because we need to know if Community law was applied.	1.5300633227371898
That should be the starting point for our efforts.	1.061229741836208
Secondly, apart from the shipowners' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage.	1.4137704700707192
Once we have done that, our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified.	1.4209454256530611
However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct.	1.4243403561044878
I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact.	1.4115296515232865
This legal framework is fairly advanced, at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied.	1.3434853105790323
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact, as others have said this afternoon, constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where, since 1967, there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers; more than one every two years.	1.2899475649138172
The economic and social damage, which we have spoken about today, in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources, is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions.	1.2688398454822982
Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented.	1.26740100191126
I trust that these measures will, in a few months, give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive, possibly - which will put an end, once and for all, to these 21st Century pirates, who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea.	1.494988846463944
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken, which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues.	1.6478740090732882
I am referring to the double hull, which consists of two layers of steel, with containers divided into two tanks.	1.1449784743003881
Commissioner, there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called 'ecological hull' in which case, in the event of an accident, the seawater penetrates the containers and, as a result of pressure, the oil is transferred to other tanks.	1.4701835680472557
Commissioner, I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures.	1.1844472022363528
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries.	1.2270185207144633
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard.	1.390597996581938
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents, is bound to support this approach.	1.208640379499663
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us, after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings, finally to produce a joint resolution.	1.3992756866824538
I think that given the dramatic circumstances, and as a matter of principle, it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes.	1.3570362919102257
On the other hand, Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote, for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area.	1.4069869753231943
I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport.	1.2290777507755142
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area. I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms.	1.3857201984538767
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation, in which we can set standards.	1.3266208305428437
I have also noted, to my great satisfaction, that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty, or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate, and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action.	1.548025184328214
We sometimes regulate things which could, by and large, remain subsidiary.	1.0301416965244445
In this area we must respond to public opinion.	1.1147630758351625
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are, when all is said and done, on the global scale merely a peninsula.	1.1331555592600042
Therefore, once our legislation has been brought into line, we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law. We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the 'polluter pays' principle of responsibility which is, of course, supposed to be a deterrent.	1.4118833958305486
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport, which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations.	1.2215927167040497
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing.	1.2663858344377779
Mr President, the oil tanker Erika, the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which was hired by Total-Fina for the transport of oil, foundered off the Breton coastline, with disastrous consequences.	1.2700894960229654
The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous.	1.1723226604786836
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker.	0.9872014830355648
So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods.	0.8269741753994251
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection.	0.8700744850940092
States can carry out port inspections.	0.5562717456574593
In Europe, legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25% of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive.	1.1551247628785157
However, it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors.	1.2908655518047039
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation.	1.0669951278833805
In my opinion, the Commissioner is quite right.	1.320282960275547
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation.	0.8814863273447977
But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors, esteemed European Commission?	1.0234006288040305
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States?	0.9456265193190891
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored?	0.8969236091200473
Would it not be beneficial, in the short term, following the Rotterdam model, to inspect according to a points system in which, for example, account is taken of the ship' s age, whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience.	1.1444897309412476
In short, to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements.	1.0667543514242162
The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled.	0.8851907573420136
There are four more sister ships in service at present.	0.8094816675245627
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high.	1.0524368145573688
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag.	0.8866200539372304
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen?	1.0397093941127218
Would sanctions not be appropriate, as the Commissioner stated, for the classification society?	1.4195463109385733
RINA is currently the talk of the town.	0.8254332174324903
Malta is entering the accession negotiations.	0.5956941123515698
In my opinion, the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future.	1.1654770609338334
I would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time, and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission.	1.2551629479799682
Mr President, just before I went down into the Chamber, I received an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who had chosen to spend New Year' s Eve on the French coast in Brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives.	1.2434278481684997
Like many other hundreds of volunteers, she had seen the destruction, washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there.	1.1423353966943401
Like so many others, I too wonder where the people responsible are.	1.3663805604999137
Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur?	0.8816019787761183
Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime.	0.9886003893102047
This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks, whether intentional or unintentional.	1.3360683485443159
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament.	1.113323001172727
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media.	1.0458998604432594
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently, I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected.	1.2591081538868192
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife, in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks, have brought back memories of similar British disasters, such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967, and have prompted many British volunteers to help.	1.2096810618090665
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage.	0.7220182950142828
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions.	1.1470193570956815
Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London, we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10% of the lost oil.	1.2906179733503143
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab.	0.9344842527785396
Ultimately, the polluter must pay.	1.1133318275342465
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered.	1.0914931518620938
Moreover, although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice, I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations.	1.3009177925945927
Rather than banning flags of convenience, which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet, under the 1995 EU directive on port state control, national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations.	1.1936935467379368
I sincerely hope that, particularly during the French presidency later this year, the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options, and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament.	1.4215037789771576
Mr President, it feels quite strange to be standing here again today, as I have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years, and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence, and not by force majeure.	1.451513975412673
The victims are waiting outside.	0.5875592535922277
They want answers.	0.34560834274245494
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.	1.2449412079646003
The citizens are right to ask: "do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever?"	1.065661497373539
Who will provide us with new jobs?	0.6994241349694672
When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group, rather it is a joint European challenge.	1.288329301629371
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio' s action plan with open arms.	1.290372881739799
It is equally important to note that "prevention is better than cure" .	0.8975869079000027
But there is an art to that as well.	1.0928872197674089
Deploying the German multipurpose ship "Neuwerk" - it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help.	1.1513793944683028
We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew.	1.0346007423635228
Valuable experiences were gained, and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone.	1.2435464685611743
We are therefore right to demand improved controls, sanctions and preventive measures.	1.0237763064553032
I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years, here in Parliament.	1.2263615232546412
The issue is as topical as it was before.	1.1390254805234252
Furthermore, I will not withhold my support but will endeavour, alongside my fellow MEPs, to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation.	1.4607805142808372
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my very sincere thanks, not only for the initiatives of the different groups, of Mrs Grossetête and the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, but also for the initiatives of Mr Wurtz and the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left, who proposed this debate, which has led to a positive and important discussion.	1.3571437617207585
Before the end of March, I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts, that is to say, amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament.	1.4050263659284754
I would like to tell you that, in fact, it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem.	1.4527386362449741
There are men and women who depend on fishing, gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas. They are environmentally sensitive areas, but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium.	1.23380305188189
And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation.	1.145857410752403
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done.	0.8157295820345857
In fact, I believe that things have been done by the Commission, but there is still more to do.	1.5858937471159928
This was demonstrated by the Americans who, after the Exxon Valdez disaster, within one year, adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation, which threatens, as I said earlier, to divert ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe.	1.365023105847364
In Europe, after the Amoco Cadiz, or the Urquiola on the Spanish coast, in 1976, or the Torrey Canyon, in the same year, or the many other cases there have been, we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995, particularly in the last few years.	1.5382761622000012
During these years, the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport.	1.1116797495731263
That is the reality.	1.0571587115240397
In my opinion, we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems, also deriving from American legislation, which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector.	1.3012435407374736
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail, if you wish, in an appearance before a special committee on this matter, or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months.	1.3057307863759227
My intention is - and I insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of March, also coinciding with the Council of Ministers, and, of course, before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency, for us to have texts to discuss.	1.4375505327285603
Flags of convenience are one problem, but are not the only one.	1.497609925230326
The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but, nevertheless, that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections; more than the countries with flags of convenience.	1.3531644154729314
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community.	0.8128650178088392
We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end.	1.6439196746610782
This will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union, and to deal with the notorious problem, which will no doubt arise again, of the aim of a Community register.	1.4747628490603741
I believe that this will be difficult but, in any event, we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries.	1.5711099592044648
As for the inspections, very much a key question, the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked, as Mr Hatzidakis has said.	1.65920573126188
We already have legislation.	0.6444707194640201
According to the information which the Commission services have given me, this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel, means and inspectors.	1.2458084814599253
The problem is not that only 25% are inspected, but rather how we select, how we find, the ships which constitute the highest risk, through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags.	1.3791733608513723
Unfortunately, the 25% often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements: in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily.	1.2772941076889939
Therefore, more than making amendments, we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done, apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews, especially in relation to the age of the different vessels.	1.44402036431283
And that is why we have SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored.	1.307441136465155
With regard to the question of Union inspectors, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States, which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately.	1.3813463114739655
Lastly, I would like to stress the issue of liability. Not only in terms of maximum sums insured, which I believe should be similar to those in the United States.	1.2629907494474995
We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments.	1.2252822062514233
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States, but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and, therefore, the liability of shipowners, and also to hold liable those who charter ships, which is to say the owners of the cargo.	1.3860951140524684
Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable, we will never, in my opinion, resolve these problems.	1.1833085308242066
I will end now.	0.7558686246808025
I will not expand further. We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions.	1.3042709766741072
But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done.	1.721158203840559
As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety.	1.4041823439613332
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers.	1.572602861736186
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.47513528222732565
We have taken good note of your intentions.	1.1632610152627645
I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement.	1.189740729651204
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	0.29695966651602207
Storms in Europe	-0.0
The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe.	0.924597101950867
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.7413990388362205
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward, particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union, in terms of the help that we can offer them.	1.3789331911590321
In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2.	1.133713146591418
I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it.	1.606178931850411
In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid.	1.2671790124766062
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.	0.9740470207191179
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one.	1.5718843801562303
Let me explain.	0.4927154615522146
I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest.	1.291492766430309
Indeed, for some 'forestry' districts, which have lost 20% of their trees, this represents a huge loss.	1.540039006107942
We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more.	1.3092227005873172
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years.	0.8937380879161627
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues.	1.1293864821732975
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.	1.3841601842830014
It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one.	1.274624950906719
Indeed, you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate.	1.2547522041205472
On the other hand, districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer, as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years.	1.1417311220745456
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case.	1.0210367876203383
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is, and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could.	1.4819347489893977
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, although there has indeed been an economic disaster, the real ecological catastrophes are still to come.	1.301773595676872
As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change.	1.455724472333566
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact.	1.2318508314632666
Mr President, everyone who has travelled here by car, train or aeroplane, has been able to see the extent of the damage, particularly in France, caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month.	1.3571498838823304
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster?	1.2681318790804608
Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who, on a daily basis, have had to reassure their constituents, organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services.	1.3692268220062689
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens.	0.815953976888649
Next, I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union' s Member States who, in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation, came to support the efforts of their French colleagues.	1.3708749106926321
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid.	1.0722917390258655
If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims, but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so.	1.4517668853972185
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly.	1.2201141621607305
I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies, which have been particularly badly hit.	1.063295061485738
As you said, Commissioner, we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to FIFG for investments that have been totally wiped out.	1.0673644136812777
Beyond this, I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected.	1.245324737656205
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and, on the contrary, to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments, which they urgently need.	1.4034220641998734
Mr President, the storms which devastated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused, as has been said, 90 deaths and damage to a value of FF 75 billion, i.e. EUR 11 billion.	1.2135241458671053
Almost three weeks after the disaster, several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones, 500 000 hectares of forestry land, or 100 million cubic metres of forest, have been ruined, and our historical heritage has also been affected, as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates.	1.2412701187009187
It seems quite natural that given such a disaster, national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected.	1.117652733642374
As the previous speakers have said, and as you said, Commissioner, in response to my fellow Member, Mr Martinez, with regard to another tragedy, the floods in November in the Southwest of France, you have certainly noted these disasters with concern, but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued, which has resulted in this shocking paradox. This paradox, pointed out by the previous speaker, is that it is easier, a great deal easier, to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the Union than within it.	1.4348066347370916
We know full well that what you are doing, Commissioner, and that is, limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b.	1.2196163926146881
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000.	1.016979759927245
I can show you a copy if you wish.	0.9427028553761501
We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission, but also of this Parliament, and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so.	1.4038641959370406
But for pity' s sake, and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way, please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms.	1.2533214233631595
As a matter of urgency, therefore, we must restore, within the framework of a supplementary budget, the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters.	1.4286044335305703
We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union. That, however, is another problem altogether.	1.4505123199267869
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium.	1.0897259826590742
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December.	1.0239887332666697
These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests.	0.7756085875977731
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region, Lorraine, which have suffered enormous destruction.	1.2236601724944365
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities, the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but, unfortunately, their troubles are not yet over.	1.4414881799591637
It is Europe's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster.	1.1560479964661254
I welcome Mr Barnier' s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced.	1.4054953237299188
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter, as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this.	1.2062131666845293
The Community action programme for civil protection, established by a Council decision on 9 December, was launched on 1 January 2000.	1.3385468683879695
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity. This programme must work at full capacity.	1.2756639388951858
Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry.	1.3877023447546062
Our priority, as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up, is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States.	1.2636328198977393
It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads, and to repair them as quickly as possible.	1.3351250993610142
Lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure.	0.8410215746187404
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest, and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood.	1.0835167295986197
Finally, it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood, in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls.	1.2958649454416926
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States.	0.7916670921083411
This aid for gathering timber is, of course, only the first stage of an aid package, which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas.	1.2488835728623517
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over.	1.2398438421030102
This is a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies.	1.1714962650704857
It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity.	1.1627146896082727
If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile, it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry.	1.2777508370084592
Hurricane "Lothar" should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here -, but to switch to the precautionary principle, under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too.	1.16727576242695
Current programmes must be accelerated.	0.5702432894588529
For example, as they stand, the Commission' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto.	1.4200172866837937
The trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem, it shelves it.	1.1487777036367517
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term.	0.963216233677587
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources, as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases.	1.1910954678427959
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject, and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate!	1.454084111453364
Commissioner, Mr President, Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto.	1.2151901236462086
However, it has now achieved notoriety.	1.6737331926898897
The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims, mainly in France and Germany, but also in Switzerland, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.	1.2216748022803356
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons, roofs, traffic signs and, ultimately over the forest.	0.9849037050700845
We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber, and this is only an estimate.	1.2035859157054882
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner, and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany.	1.3169920772836692
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual.	1.2409266089608684
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region, or in a 5b region?	1.351816268209059
What answer will the Commission give, when it is on the scene, when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building, and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc.? All this is well-intentioned advice.	1.3196436552074748
However, I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage.	1.3835703997893454
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.	1.1169057732882866
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid, so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date.	1.2173757361631272
Mr President, Commissioner, permit me, first of all, to make reference to two facts.	1.14135053900964
Firstly, at the beginning of 1999, NATO, with the participation of most Member States of the European Union, flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom.	1.2810746317091535
We are now endeavouring, at huge cost, to get the country back on its feet again and help its people, and rightly so.	1.4069972234215782
Secondly, at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU.	1.198535066009431
The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders.	1.0193961669581162
"We do not have the wherewithal for that," they said.	1.2392870817292672
This is wrong!	0.3455865222931484
And no one can comprehend this attitude.	0.8457288775223206
Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss.	0.920152424791262
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity, also from within this Community.	1.2596546697810571
I say they have a right to solidarity.	0.9835733699744402
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need.	1.286885172745843
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms.	1.2710953999988683
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority.	0.7693147310348117
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will.	1.2423982275738767
Permit me one further comment. Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm, the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter.	1.3205922813626758
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency.	1.166822019479606
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations.	1.006502103079856
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment.	0.9301179250719794
Then, for example, people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart.	1.141436733469357
When, in 1994, over five years ago that is, I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament, I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier.	1.5940923709219272
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work.	1.34577945819374
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again!	1.2529774767292963
Mr President, Commissioner, the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems.	0.948679286865408
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters.	0.8738735148348914
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be.	0.8347640474619457
Of course, there is a need for solidarity here.	1.10636289458329
There is certainly a need for European civil protection, and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters.	1.4631186131263474
But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes.	1.4302484933205415
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density, the type of infrastructure, and, of course, the many monocultures, if we are talking forests.	1.401301288578607
Of course, I am in favour of providing assistance where we can.	1.241098343534381
But when it comes to aid, we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future, more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground.	1.3522725503574446
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation, rather than monocultures.	1.016735747437342
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate.	1.15442926674366
To this day, we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream, and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff.	1.4414127084537636
America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go.	1.1733439246856283
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream.	0.6683255552498452
But in common with others, we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect.	1.2288069127947936
This is partly the work of human hand, as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations.	1.6036472650423967
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference.	1.2863481313665228
We must reduce CO2 emissions, employ renewable energies, and generally make enquiries, in this connection, as to how the forests of Europe are faring.	1.4736782634881473
Mr President, I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims.	1.125804761698803
This is an irreparable loss.	1.1735949752385253
Secondly, we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens, and the solidarity of other countries with France, which is the country worst affected.	1.5383870055248243
As I have little time, Mr President, I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution.	1.2268657328005927
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not.	1.154076273340631
That is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities, in general terms, are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years.	1.2230339288984176
In fact, over the last decade, the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century.	1.2325186522428406
Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals.	1.0079396751771228
Secondly, I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner' s proposal to create a European civil protection body.	1.51957497581217
Furthermore, we should utilise an extraordinary budget line, since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation.	1.5529171912345248
First of all, we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy.	1.2821142354430193
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards.	1.0130749145132774
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this.	1.1753759715828789
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this.	1.291031363638258
That is important.	0.3906482444523105
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past.	1.304392204638419
It was very small.	0.5349382699828819
It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major.	1.2576758010616609
Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels, whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies.	1.2088526623539115
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished.	1.051609406280156
I think we should reinstate this budget line.	0.9404789212905685
When we had the earthquake in Greece, which was a big disaster, the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks.	1.3233344026870677
The same when the floods came in France and the same again now.	1.119134030130896
These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it.	1.6118466584166449
We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument.	1.146045022910843
We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it.	1.0376002986251633
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic.	1.151431433979367
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these.	1.1786689156407122
Ladies and gentlemen, none of us must forget what has taken place.	1.1496214897809793
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines.	1.2860520196237268
It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development, forestry would be eligible under Article 33, companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds.	1.1907469149092063
It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical, active solidarity.	1.1472773496900446
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul.	1.1800450043689683
This is inadequate, and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which, moreover, I expressed when I told the press in Bordeaux what I am hoping for, and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security.	1.3464497790553325
If the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being, if the mandate that our President, Mrs Fontaine has staked on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe' s citizens is to be effective, our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency.	1.5352028982049486
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force, real civil relief blue helmets, who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union, as we currently have no emergency procedure, but also outside the Union if needs be, in Venezuela or anywhere else, is something that we should hope to see. I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit.	1.4406553761392829
Mr President, Commissioner, when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation, we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly.	1.3169783039678993
Nevertheless, the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us.	1.2425488735020782
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well.	0.9995344750718465
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously, and at the same time, from my position here in this Chamber, point to how important it is to support these regions and people.	1.3734286407319825
Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow.	0.962805509641526
What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible.	1.0585419966952003
For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long.	1.1936565367257213
For instance, it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle' s larvae, and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have.	1.3362041012728196
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives.	1.0117031818641797
Decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry.	0.9031591150513351
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow.	1.0066334911650516
The calculations are in decades rather than years.	0.6798519618924249
In addition, I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production, for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions.	1.116893898662482
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared.....	1.1084605316711276
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
Mr President, I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms.	1.1698973843179092
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries.	1.2669036373374347
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank.	0.8179572795688329
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland.	1.2959749690331408
We had high winds and unprecedented, prolonged rainfall which, adding to existing difficulties, resulted in thousands of acres being submerged, sometimes, in up to 15 feet of water.	1.0733000277027291
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms, no sanitation, no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water.	1.1796462120953792
I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water.	0.6989413819643746
Natural habitats were destroyed.	0.42207139079416633
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case.	0.9234864428607382
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force.	1.240559970773013
Mr President, Commissioner, I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims.	1.149645653931782
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe.	1.1510158499836636
For the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe, and I believe we need, in the long-term, to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future.	1.4164723476237737
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests, but maybe we should set up a system, perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector, which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way.	1.4387288903598108
Unfortunately, we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future.	1.3822134141620044
As has already been mentioned here, there are indications - no proof, but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe.	1.3378932576255493
Of course, the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet, but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing, these storms will, of course, hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century.	1.3512458779749297
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours, Tom Spencer. He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women, we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time.	1.3016459424979354
However, an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP, for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate, rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability.	1.288311700478028
We must be aware of this connection; I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm, but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course!	1.4043839840366954
I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	0.7362265685245909
That concludes the debate.	0.19308667519260808
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday.	1.2416540720748839
Food safety	-0.0
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission.	1.3292488673411944
Mr President, I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to Parliament the main lines of the Commission's White Paper on food safety, adopted on Wednesday last, 12 January, in association with my colleague, Mr Liikanen.	1.4658227251271017
At my hearing last September, I promised speedy delivery of this White Paper.	1.0450833455650301
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly.	1.1232143201823712
The White Paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new Commission was appointed last September.	0.9652928675242041
It takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the Commission's Green Paper on food law was published.	1.2326278016873524
Equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge, as well as the BSE crisis.	1.0325518817105561
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed.	1.3808742514076842
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months.	1.1526164462128166
The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world.	1.0489490923242646
When I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth.	1.1138216726653147
The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe.	0.8706961324363158
If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions. This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers, producers and industry generally.	1.0362799178565612
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually, even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects.	1.0047613569578655
Between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees.	0.8885284002788347
High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness.	0.7838621168790326
This crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety.	0.9980240727238726
In saying all of this, I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems.	1.2693865134188196
The challenge is to make the system the very best.	1.1226071894400536
The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food.	1.0263891989055398
We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change.	0.9507567741387617
The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule.	1.393241567017443
We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders.	1.3799515296675802
The White Paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing EU food legislation.	0.858431764308613
All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent, understandable and flexible.	1.1650431901373037
We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers.	1.1576523630263265
The detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years.	1.020615445013697
Over 80 measures are envisaged.	0.5732803346275271
Our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002.	1.059652111979184
We are also envisaging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime.	1.2035480504511868
This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate.	0.9191355455368266
It has already attracted much comment, including reactions from Members of Parliament.	1.161072588982125
The chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments.	0.7965972958103625
We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage.	1.1712477854324437
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments.	1.2890830244862574
The Commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence.	1.0835392114807032
Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change?	1.019156638400948
The first key concern is independence.	0.6092183020770552
Key stakeholders, including consumers, are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests.	1.2684102651515887
We must also ensure excellence and transparency.	0.9517868732911885
We have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis.	1.0757705679959741
However, the Commission believes that we must go further.	1.6039263634929863
We must create a permanent and truly independent, excellent and transparent system of risk assessment.	0.9497017127379448
The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety.	1.0585176785210002
We envisage that the work of the existing five Scientific Committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority.	1.0015494560129012
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority's establishment.	1.2359082109436976
However, if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs, this would clearly not be enough.	1.5686982736073287
As the White Paper makes clear, the new authority must be a value-added structure.	1.3104471038579135
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened.	1.144796111130991
Within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists.	0.9580852433103519
I am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react, identify issues before they become crises.	1.0554689307143572
This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority.	0.7646723184304057
To be proactive the White Paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority.	1.1030130509241922
These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function, the coordination of scientific information in the EU, and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States.	1.138111226269901
As part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns.	0.9818051553062639
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority.	1.1943890606217056
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	1.2254146684240552
I make no apology for this approach; I firmly believe that it is the correct one.	1.176123409370951
Certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority.	1.137740261225337
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion.	1.097349255246255
It was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process.	1.3435103273658382
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be, in my view, a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability.	1.1914749323978235
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter.	1.3238004881998704
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority.	1.4578617694373972
I also reject this line of argument.	0.6597507257072187
How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety?	0.9651110109419156
Would this be in the interests of Europe's citizens?	0.9369949295940654
In my view, most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based, rationally argued and fully justified.	1.036208014379711
It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving.	0.7874401334520252
I can assure you here today that the Commission, in exercising its risk management functions, will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority.	1.3908786244317841
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States.	0.9830198277588867
This is a major task.	1.3502799290087282
We must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the European Union.	0.9719983802482076
The authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues.	1.0025188295014502
This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself.	1.1381017398038364
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science.	1.2264857611961728
However, with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies, the authority will become pre-eminent on the European stage.	1.4666809897078283
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard.	1.2315471707737422
As an integral part of a value-added structure, the White Paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication: to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk; to be highly visible; to tell the good news story about food; to be proactive.	1.312301359606836
The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls.	0.958947757406356
This is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are complying with Community legislation.	1.1172584912548376
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena.	1.2535334242295064
In this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in Dublin.	1.2098949445128255
This revised Community framework would have three core elements: operational criteria set up at Community level, Community control guidelines, and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control.	1.1892357493563352
As part of our proposals in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the Commission.	1.5570451011228728
These could include withholding Community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a Member State.	0.768467495747064
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world, boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union.	1.163949666135218
In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community-level, the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community's legislation, covering all aspects of food products from farm to table.	1.3685652723651054
It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation.	0.9458120032881884
The new legal framework will cover animal feed, animal health and welfare, hygiene, contaminants and residues, novel food, additives, flavourings, packaging and irradiation.	0.9055350901075805
It will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers, farmers and food operators, traceability of feed, food and ingredients, proper risk analysis through, for instance, risk assessment - that is, scientific advice and information analysis - risk management - that is, regulation and control - risk communication, and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate.	1.2654358863752615
As regards the precautionary principle, I might add that the Commission is currently finalising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon.	1.5170309998607368
I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available.	1.1961635934833823
However, having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees, I recognise that this was not feasible.	1.5671263933367041
But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper's proposals on the authority.	1.3368963548170654
We now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission's ideas on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority.	1.2845600958516143
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate.	1.1036880483850462
Parliament played a crucial role in Europe's response to the BSE crisis.	0.9690106595513618
It has especially active since then in bringing citizens' concerns about food safety issues to the fore.	0.962158988182518
I expect that Parliament's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive.	1.05117006250882
While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our views, I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe.	1.4724167895823457
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible.	1.11100008872501
It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union's food safety regime.	1.2917674665204826
The European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU's food safety regime in the years ahead.	1.0630879185291415
It is essential that we get the mix right.	1.078419887060172
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement.	1.2721173561914734
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions, including the Commission and Parliament.	1.4386006203047934
That is very much the right approach.	1.1243200787153727
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight.	1.4288108162406155
I hope that we can thrash this out.	1.1085354569085633
We need a body of food law, as you have said, and we need to agree this together.	1.4839197850557302
It is very important that we include liability in that process.	0.9208911153560568
That is the one word I am talking about.	1.32338168749127
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong.	0.846432079889076
That cannot continue.	0.34641859728757707
When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem, those responsible are liable.	1.3948513874776483
Mr President, it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority.	1.3592066244410559
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed.	0.839762632233699
You are unclear about this in your White Paper.	0.7549689326730791
What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list?	1.1117450433677627
When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof?	1.1716939587711233
The final part of my question is as follows: when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States?	1.0776059520391177
That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper.	1.2510521244302386
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.	1.1788515631924315
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality.	1.2028418057586974
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one.	1.5218212371454443
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs.	1.1437250158823131
However, as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years, I have to ask: if Europe has the safest food control system, as you have said, why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives?	1.3752621762293493
Secondly, will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States?	1.4355770660360487
We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this.	0.9556410729385679
Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws, given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003?	1.1607424330066514
President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper.	1.302659794082495
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised.	1.389033526695629
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability.	0.6230864296846474
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability.	1.335255936759952
Once that is done, issues such as liability can be addressed.	0.8741441433382754
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved.	1.281833655538772
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration.	1.5549203424232203
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list.	0.9002401242052277
That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation, and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material.	1.342227006390562
At the moment the list is, as I say, a negative list and it is added to as required.	1.5564188507865424
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it, 2002 in fact.	1.1628998628358922
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation.	1.0851273361709641
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed.	0.9589664972436395
This is unfortunate and it is wrong, and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done.	1.3661639233574663
The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in Member States is ongoing, I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way.	1.3661689096597824
I hope that the next time you ask me the question, I will be in a position to give you more detailed information.	1.4115907690637441
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation.	0.9771959033842771
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation.	1.123367127611558
It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation, although that is part of it, but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them.	1.3268373984860626
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind.	1.3626043977570845
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen.	1.296816846111663
Commissioner, the ignorance of certain Member States has landed us in a major food crisis here in Europe, and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance, and that on the day that you present your interesting report.	1.4577877496700793
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind, whatever name it goes by, will be given influence over the Council, who in this authority will have the say in matters, and who will issue orders.	1.4297106533120776
Of course, we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content, but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam, and even extending them.	1.3434856852435553
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that.	1.2973685264351833
I also welcome the White Paper.	0.7549427470089042
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France's refusal to lift the ban?	1.2402051287678624
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting.	1.1098214454073947
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance, similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment?	1.3680959596662758
Mr President, you said during last week' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery was.	1.4133949567599777
For example, the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters.	1.1704258205358427
It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather, publish and coordinate data, make recommendations for improved food safety, and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers.	1.311855642288444
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union.	1.1318618735467025
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location?	1.1591057541283607
In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time.	1.2609507054148614
In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board.	1.3262341451929542
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board.	1.0725834668668188
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months.	1.2417151848129497
I envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders.	1.0067783105433992
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September.	1.4789683873302797
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September.	1.2791384676595585
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.	1.1653974623268428
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice.	0.842018608410152
But it would have an overall remit, particularly, for instance, in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research.	1.4171731533105443
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that.	0.9611640303806226
That is an issue for consideration and discussion.	1.1259443247703123
There may be a number of views on that.	0.9697389163600656
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board.	1.3748456331720162
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament, through nominees or even MEPs themselves, were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated.	1.2308618912493419
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out.	1.3985342832843506
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity.	0.8566970861304698
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile.	1.2382465016308826
It must be visible.	0.5850147454036285
It must be known.	0.8576268139442277
Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority.	1.3127211649816943
The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known, who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food, particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition, diet and such issues, so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority.	1.2508306706208545
They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority.	1.1046826746378045
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous.	1.0517660524473535
It must be visible.	0.5850147454036285
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority.	1.1175198184885708
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth.	0.9915056076559418
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end.	1.1979637209434015
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level.	1.176115519471874
Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for, or advising, the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level.	1.1009637764202571
That is an undesirable situation, we do not want that situation in the future.	1.3970167217097675
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one.	0.9509845088553813
But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern.	1.102503222781002
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists, that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond, where experts are to be found elsewhere.	1.3026513520930225
Over time, as I said a moment ago, not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise, its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged.	1.3302428894587748
This situation can be achieved over a period of time.	0.8461916014951999
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence. It is something that is earned over a period of time.	1.1254708137837284
However, the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	1.3800476805150776
I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but, nonetheless, the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward.	1.4333484335808462
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way.	1.137175246805372
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance.	1.2173616202031368
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process.	1.1323385752941582
In relation to grants and subsidies: yes, consideration has been given to that issue.	0.932550175947578
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought, particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling.	1.227349910250838
In relation to Mrs Lynne's question on interim payments: that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues.	1.3182192624367253
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority.	0.8001712541535788
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	1.176285799436797
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!	1.6238824910038268
But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority.	0.8813800677611889
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin.	1.2300651768139765
The Food Safety Authority's situation is quite different.	0.9297964730197537
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation.	1.1999248531872573
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean, what problems they have identified, what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise.	1.3419931719036025
Equally, the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process, to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified.	1.3444792532803376
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located.	1.1276850158034242
Scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and, in those circumstances, as scientists will have to travel, it is probably better that they move to a central location, once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based.	1.4725455874839104
That is my judgement at the moment.	1.0318610662352143
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	1.1294108421706703
Colleagues, I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda.	1.4909692056895658
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents.	1.2665118806165552
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important, I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them.	1.2732963543566982
On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner, and his statement.	1.6513455013607146
As you can see, half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session.	1.0272625318471054
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions.	1.417382464795487
That concludes the debate.	0.19308667519260808
Question Time (Commission)	0.3763026442786636
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	0.9915140624595835
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time.	0.6638029039441679
We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session.	0.9482585686472215
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion.	0.5869797966615448
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda.	1.235760583828932
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda.	1.5162193554202799
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m., and you can see the clock.	1.4066867511326118
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event.	1.5278417201898846
First Part	-0.0
Question No 28 by (H-0781/99):	0.7677543773981416
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	0.5410005525470423
Turkey's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	0.6670729390043211
What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	0.5970042528251284
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.6595928627255191
The Commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu, Turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards.	1.280620494403592
According to our information, the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet.	1.2177314194221283
The Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority.	0.9686881147572305
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production, including the nuclear option.	1.2001899000827234
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.	1.5011776829152899
In particular, the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site.	1.2163001222243675
According to information received from the International Atomic Agency, the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana.	1.205235431458352
Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site.	1.2457063995337339
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material.	1.1785681813572224
It acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.	1.1328542484680522
Thank you for your reply.	0.5091778424529624
I should like to make the following points: Turkey is now a candidate country.	1.3155787615806656
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2%.	0.5442858616029295
At the same time, it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada, which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India.	1.3098340107267397
In this sense, there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology.	1.2729830399160598
So much for the political aspect.	0.8272126394476219
Now to the technical aspect. The safety factor in this type of project, and I am speaking as an engineer, has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty.	1.347840910101927
In cases such as this, where there is uncertainty, simulators are used.	0.977019386937959
However, we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy.	1.2745375062819355
In this sense, all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this.	1.0028180693075663
Therefore, and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed, it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union.	1.5120253663471217
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries.	1.1768986654695606
I have explained the position of the Commission.	0.8173956429043258
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety.	1.2068419079983626
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable.	1.18583389803314
In the case of Turkey it is different.	0.9247275180042015
The plant is not yet there.	0.9339130148469194
I have already said that Turkey is part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.	1.102051484536281
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey.	1.1373721598967468
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.	1.0958083094053335
Mr President, the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty, it has signed the nuclear safety treaties: why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community, and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter?	1.4236581995033397
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears.	1.5732564874064126
I do not have these concerns.	1.2447874744688392
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty, but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament.	1.5122464360451822
Question No 29 by (H-0786/99):	0.7501147591685661
Subject: Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict?	1.044740685696103
If not, why not?	0.616959217326673
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.7314655531081516
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your question.	1.3445372397198394
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action.	1.43345528465754
As early as last June the Commission financed a first study. It was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe.	1.1900288300738324
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment.	0.7508743335535187
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force.	1.2234676186400948
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it.	1.375170391369878
The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net.	1.096020650439888
The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict.	1.0598225020708942
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission.	0.7127775169137037
However, this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium.	1.1866895854196662
From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks, if any, are limited to an area around the target.	1.1696949120110287
Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed.	1.2583881059773434
It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed.	0.9685414897878848
First of all, Mr President, can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response.	1.4483846470879438
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue.	1.4219166179058378
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used.	1.1827234189630091
This uranium becomes air-borne, is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far.	1.2737060371162454
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war.	1.1087940240395746
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects, not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo?	1.3682892567918628
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons?	1.060614419081701
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for that question.	1.3367686404464838
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo.	1.2348761278073395
But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium.	1.1234016475126576
That is also mentioned in the report.	0.8636726325425803
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.	1.0739867148552993
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted.	1.3122012070107947
A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report, so they have to take responsibility.	1.386878197918614
But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is, for the time being, the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union.	1.3128948415694086
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States, as well as the United Nations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment.	1.5384200561950976
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons.	1.1477891451672202
Mr President, Commissioner, in a few months' time, hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday.	1.0392251715770606
We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast.	0.8402072857914462
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer, and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect?	1.303054973747523
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to.	1.0457128477568614
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this.	0.8998278476135873
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do.	0.9211545007003747
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous.	1.2916865303009202
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution.	1.1112905527491728
That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system.	1.2353378118758993
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise.	1.2785262566559368
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area?	1.304118148362906
I cannot answer that question.	0.5032908901118593
When it comes to medical checks and so on, I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer.	1.322046558690767
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned, that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan, but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that.	1.5111369370932997
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information.	1.2101149268799931
Question No 30 by (H-0793/99):	0.751525604179121
Subject: Appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in exile received over 4000 Tibetans who escaped over the Himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb.	1.1529587045184162
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way.	0.8476712649979226
The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet.	1.2837373919955182
The Tibet Intergroup, therefore, gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama?s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet, calls on the Commission to appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue.	1.2777247882037615
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet?	0.6634043998859291
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.5431039271632084
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared.	1.1028844489681082
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues, including Tibet, firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities.	1.1315228375238517
The European Union did that at the European Union­China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues, including Tibet.	1.2652433111394488
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.	0.7636792339603595
I urge the Chinese again to do so.	0.9885675870675832
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities.	0.7498675920089198
We are also doing a number of other things: in the European Union-China human rights dialogue, we have focused on a number of practical steps, including sending experts on assignment to Tibet, planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health, education and training for Tibetans.	1.3256137720190349
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them.	1.1454914913752177
But for my part, I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts.	1.2591153768353531
It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile.	1.1269692864645007
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, however worthy the cause.	1.2028864077282864
Mr President, Mr Patten, of course, you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China, and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate, something which has always been blocked hitherto.	1.3700711361146962
However, if your response was to be that we should turn to "Mr CFSP" , that is, to Mr Solana, then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter.	1.4690704851754515
Your approach, which I am very much in favour of, since it is a coherent one, takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights.	1.4323502496419092
Imprisonment, torture, the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth, are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum.	1.343836335677337
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this, then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve.	1.21246839888853
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place, but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation, would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.	1.5080572517417108
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is.	1.014549591880363
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the Council.	0.9490325921990812
As it happens, we deal with the budgetary consequences, the Council makes the appointment.	1.421815214740237
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course.	0.936865829244947
Putting that on one side, because that is the situation, it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues.	1.4091785221988211
I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out, among other things, that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union.	1.3265791412596393
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world.	1.1116929488052354
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet.	1.3534033795891933
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice, first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest.	1.2290850077609345
If I can make a literary commendation to the honourable Member, who I recognise is interested in these subjects, I recommend to him a book published just before Christmas written by Isabel Hilton, the distinguished journalist, on the problems of Tibet.	1.244805278385424
Mr President, I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting, which betokens peace and happiness.	1.2387367624440662
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned, rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace, serenity, compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans.	1.391860108916961
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness, the Dalai Lama' s, proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair?	1.223711754680358
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people.	1.2226397156348883
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition.	0.9522491316548585
Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama.	0.8749338894137242
It is an extremely moving account, not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well.	1.4148235218491436
The Commission, like others, has urged dialogue.	1.55980446037855
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes.	1.0079503151887503
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama.	0.928641331889405
At or around the time of President Clinton's visit to China, the President of the People's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda.	1.1527231205783992
It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue.	1.4102568800755595
Question No 31 by (H-0795/99):	0.7783364618290279
Subject: Commission's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizens? right to proper administration in the EU.	1.1797850065834588
Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration, it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made, but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service.	1.3433848374678112
Are these reports accurate?	0.529647957087251
What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way, and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration?	1.357728073623415
Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September, and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it?	1.3012908567600785
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.5431039271632084
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate.	0.9250775919570365
In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure.	1.0315803548152018
At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document, a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks.	1.5016503077104573
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.	1.060421053712171
It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code.	1.1964089360442067
The Commission would like to stress in particular that, in the drafting of the code, it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman.	1.6873977601527934
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission's administration with the public.	1.3408876031677046
It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.	1.2677891687812664
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman's office.	1.2280111909807256
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself.	1.3042566701789258
However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform.	1.3181857165842374
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner.	1.068106001442873
However, I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force, bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997.	1.4252312935336162
The newspaper reports were misleading.	0.630883262745957
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman.	1.4574814123789275
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that.	1.5275699976399613
I want to repeat that honourable Members, like the honourable Member who asked the question, who take a particular interest in this issue, will want to have a dialogue about it.	1.3516027001140176
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member.	1.0085452029667208
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer.	1.3263975044612613
For safety' s sake, I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that, where the Commission and good administration are concerned, there is no part of Jacob Söderman' s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable.	1.4747198622343765
Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved?	1.148285311319871
Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true! "I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999".	1.5675639683437066
Both documents, that is the Commission's document and the Ombudsman's draft, cover largely the same ground.	1.3032067918394876
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis.	0.8678731721290008
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue.	1.3085545364722393
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten' s notes into the bibliography, as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind.	1.2289693864537128
As the author is not present, Question No 32 lapses.	0.6944629154414912
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. I am sorry.	1.289571044178157
According to the Rules of Procedure, you are not required to reply.	1.0884300584115976
I wish you a good evening.	0.8459496663846336
Second Part	-0.0
Questions to Mr Nielson, who is replaced by Mr Patten	1.220728807584857
Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague, Mr Nielson, was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is, trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survives.	1.354039804490932
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development, part of the so-called induction courses for new staff, something that has been done already but not, I admit, on a regular basis.	1.2276606526422196
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point.	1.0034589489417498
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory.	0.783207419769303
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management.	1.0121710089137532
As far as possible, we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset, instead of having to be tackled separately and later.	1.2589865452349782
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on.	1.033835940892283
The quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all levels.	0.9659081394723789
It is not to be brought in as a "sort of optional add-on" .	1.1617804036105128
This must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies, together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women' s and men' s priorities and needs are better reflected.	1.125982986608282
In addition, measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender.	1.3080990133136992
Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals, action plans and strategies.	1.01103322028025
It would appear that we are in agreement about this.	1.2864603664118957
However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.	1.223087719657356
If the latter do not have the required professional competence, then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority.	1.3199187098621388
Extremely few members of the Directorate-General for Development, that is to say unit managers and more senior managers, have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised.	1.1950467954308979
Only one manager has participated in gender training, and for half a day.	1.1490592673340247
That is naturally unacceptable.	0.5379327328376382
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training?	1.0125106509750956
Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees, but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course.	1.207332736834147
This limited training element has, however, been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times.	1.1812602387321989
As I point out in my question, one to two days, and not one to two hours, need to be devoted to the subject.	1.4139881653372537
My question is this: is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development?	1.0570477328766121
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson.	0.8434130483885267
I must not go on about books, but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues, in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies, going back millennia.	1.3606491006515689
Secondly, in my view, while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential. And, since it should be essential, I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training.	1.6439725249605115
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority.	0.7418858626208499
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.	1.1398632820239114
Thirdly, one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground.	1.299521717127351
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said.	0.7842143523213001
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves.	1.1134319150903773
Since 1991, the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia.	1.4960285470546233
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme.	1.0332768607701295
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million.	0.8224302029734305
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors, in particular agriculture, infrastructure development, the private economy and the strengthening of institutions.	1.2844212017758647
Security considerations have prevented Tajikistan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999.	1.0206636104883051
In addition to national programmes, the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy, transport and environmental sectors.	1.3917528909140666
Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996, following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind.	1.2562359309079771
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent, Tajikistan.	1.08076308493226
Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999.	0.7521856326993646
Over the same period, Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million.	0.5705114308822604
Since 1993 the Commission's European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.	1.1957135097725033
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million, mainly for food, medical supplies, water and sanitation.	1.0482740169909008
Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process.	1.1766773588258432
Mr President, Commissioner, there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century.	1.0229691463006612
That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular. That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence, how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going, that is, with regard to political relations that is.	1.4513025131061323
Of course, that falls within your remit; my next question falls within Mr Nielson' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation, in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton monocultures, which are the cause of great aridity.	1.4314660536450157
We were able, at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago, to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics.	1.2334939561073388
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them.	1.2691629468609982
I can send the honourable Member, if he would like, a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics.	1.1897175641369169
Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side.	1.0936254802551055
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia.	1.3543861254843197
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well.	1.2026531893330044
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise, had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible.	1.3699351203371541
So the honourable Member's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made.	1.0023719186750644
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact.	1.0828285309914254
Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation.	0.9581262591780404
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land.	0.8555025811194401
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to.	1.3209121474855814
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner' s answer.	1.2488581258987228
This is not the usual state of affairs.	1.050000363587294
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time.	0.9552093795437755
Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your interventions today.	1.2616407995330212
Question No 35 by (H-0778/99):	0.7681010684412177
Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies.	1.2794842548508034
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with.	1.2243368706633464
The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges, or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies, and, in addition, that there are no exact employment figures.	1.381367470493138
Could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment, and what these commitments are? Has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing, recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment, or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work?	1.244814992895013
As far as Mr Papayannakis' question is concerned, in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment, the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment.	1.3636474171514175
The most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services, where problems exist, improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment.	1.1327827155569314
The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy: "Yes to Work" and "Back to Work" .	1.1465435550500902
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.	1.214534320262829
The Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed, firstly, to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece, secondly, to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and, thirdly, to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies.	1.2699712540855461
In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006, which is being financed from the Social Fund, both the resources and the policies should be used, with the Commission' s support, to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier.	1.5860006956267252
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made.	1.2771908733202684
Thank you, Commissioner for your reply.	1.1896899309373574
However, our current situation is as follows: at 11.3%, we have the second highest unemployment in Europe, which was not previously the case, we have the biggest increase in unemployment, we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed, i.e. less than 1% of GDP, while other countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany spend 3-4%, and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used, inter alia, to combat unemployment.	1.4847637102576716
You tell me that you, as the Commission, have made recommendations.	1.6061807910716315
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to.	1.0071098576795818
However, my question for a very long time has been this: what happened with previous policies?	1.4592091845123907
Did anyone find work?	0.4408986187707975
How many people found work?	0.7310629934304355
If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before.	1.3433678934205389
What has been done about training?	1.1048138470810454
Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees?	0.8186343508278573
Do we have any figures?	0.8267761969893916
In other words, do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece?	1.2274164599886388
Mr Papayannakis, the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies.	1.2264087777514667
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and, as far as I can see, an increase in productivity.	1.3109947401726432
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines.	1.408555431877178
As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated.	1.1318995366102704
They concern access to training, the ratio of men to women with access to training, and special action for the long-term unemployed.	1.071912055181569
The Commission will endeavour, for all these specific guidelines, to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006.	1.5253049575392796
Question No 36 by (H-0782/99):	0.6265326349062238
Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy?	1.315122452284045
The Danish pension scheme, the Efterløn, only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire.	1.2178126669808507
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire.	1.3447861977803663
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law.	1.0225852268048892
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are, however, still pending before the Council.	1.3923346927581817
There is, as yet, no European Court case law on Efterløn, but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality.	1.236338192719465
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach.	1.3095610974661327
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark.	1.2745839707134419
I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission, but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been.	1.2233769866000037
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission.	1.1429204815184664
The Commissioner also more than hinted, of course, that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions, due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system.	1.216320761905647
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter, for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate.	1.3079580775686845
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question.	0.7834996045754455
Honourable Member, I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law.	1.2856084713167069
This is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter, to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who, as things stand, have a right to this pension.	1.4467224907273173
Briefly, just to follow on from that last point, I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission's objections, such as they are, would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme, but simply that the Commission has a concern, which it has the right to have under Community law, to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify.	1.6357296697144894
I think that the answer is brief and clear.	1.1642970085604396
Of course it is as you say.	1.0001852965709646
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark, that is not where the problem lies.	1.3083210042498699
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark.	0.9616117236191192
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99):	0.6285942998179878
Subject: Working time directive Can the Commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection, equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive, for non-consultant hospital doctors, who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amending directive (COM(98)0662-C4-0715/98 - 98/0318(SYN))?	1.245963433202244
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors.	1.1174600520006102
The content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors, with the possibility, following negotiation, of increasing it to 54 hours.	1.3663480311671068
The Council, Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive.	1.2750983892287737
Parliament has proposed 4 years, the Commission 7 and the Council 13.	1.5966744241887423
This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure.	1.3259576549758612
Although there is this disagreement, I should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout Europe.	1.3669632268583711
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99):	0.6366981912758939
Subject: Measures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality (gender mainstreaming).	1.155061769745857
Which Commissioners are members of this group?	1.2164054328280098
How many meetings of the group have been held to date?	1.1773852337864703
What concrete measures have been discussed?	0.7719827235771612
This question covers several individual matters.	0.5472261450182032
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality.	0.840660473338258
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi, Vice-President Kinnock, Mr Reding and myself.	1.1576211526096647
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000.	1.127907961685947
Three serious issues were discussed: the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women, of which I gave an initial evaluation, the second issue was the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science, and the third involved Mr Kinnock, who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the Community.	1.3224730557968822
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your reply, although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet, since this matter is of the greatest importance.	1.4961718044796268
We trusted this Commission, from the outset, to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women.	1.2806206492424073
I hope that, in the future, things will change and meetings will become frequent, because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude, as quickly as possible, those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women.	1.354665694669327
Mrs Avilés-Perea, that was an exhortation rather than a question.	1.1715817673047995
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions ...	1.054680378568218
Allow me to say just one word. I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least, once it did, important decisions were taken straight away.	1.399663312510725
Question No 39 by (H-0807/99):	0.6266593342785471
Subject: Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999, the Commission adopted the Community's EQUAL initiative, the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers.	1.3213762514019973
Under this umbrella, each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country.	1.3580462725169014
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States' programmes?	1.2122638290998218
Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly?	1.0710314163412344
The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. As the EQUAL initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States, what will Greece's contribution amount to?	1.2714634824891222
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people.	0.9309077187110462
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace.	0.697231255250824
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin, where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action.	1.347057356642936
This is an important aspect of this initiative.	0.9584988488504672
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation. This is the same as the Social Fund regulation, i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation.	1.4629032663388635
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament' s opinion next month.	1.304498054295357
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy.	1.1161352111914915
The Member States, i.e. the national governments, have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control.	1.1614742110690777
Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation, while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control, the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors.	1.4255877891097628
The last question concerns the amount granted.	0.772886918743063
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million. The contribution commitment is 80%, rising to an 85% contribution from the initiative for the island regions, especially the remote Greek islands, and a contribution by Greece of 15%.	1.297753194973787
Mr President, I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative, especially the four actions described in it, will result both in complicated bureaucracy and, paradoxically, a non-transparent structure.	1.4041110408426913
For example, one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity, as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines.	1.1893176883654317
At the same time, the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation, the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures, as these are the only structures which can meet such demands.	1.3223890176554165
However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic.	1.3058883422993792
Finally, if you consider the overall amount, which is on the small side, - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are, I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing.	1.4501458807787642
First let me say that it would be a great help to us, now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament, if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account.	1.470769879157177
Secondly, I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment, it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment, or to support an increase in employment.	1.5148752325785755
That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund, which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal, especially for countries like Greece.	1.4410953446127241
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission. To encourage, to assist promotion, to create statistics, to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination.	1.5288633585300393
So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups, between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences; that is mainly what we are looking for, and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated.	1.3851097047835235
This is the philosophy behind the initiative; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies, non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible, so that it can get as close to the people as possible.	1.3724689567178405
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99):	0.6252482926319026
Subject: Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations (Art. 4.2).	1.169519866836039
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 (TEU) likely to be effected by such an exemption?	1.0247003749230703
A month ago, the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment, as prescribed in the Treaty, in order to implement Article 13.	1.476903939421168
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted.	0.9870124310710485
At the Commission' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies, Member States and the European Parliament, a number of exceptions have been made.	1.1932818978160895
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification.	0.897396770527093
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this.	1.1144207322717852
In a religious school, it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs.	1.2811603101457778
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about.	0.8080671365765657
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification.	1.2507630753432293
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination.	1.0367134449399815
For instance, religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example: we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian.	1.0940128128488544
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression.	1.1186155685335941
Surely what we should be doing, and I hope you will agree, Commissioner, is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability, and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice, no matter how sincerely held.	1.483651869726844
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason, be it the reason which you mentioned, sexual orientation, ethnic discrimination or any other reason.	1.1199139289268247
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question.	1.040097251964848
In other words, it is positive discrimination.	1.2884346787619703
In the example which you mentioned, it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic.	1.121683110201073
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable.	1.1803349877025977
Question No 41 by (H-0813/99):	0.627383995658834
Subject: Promoting jobs for women in severely less-favoured regions Given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less-favoured regions, and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on, in terms of either finance, entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities, living as they do in rural districts where 80% of the population is on the poverty line, what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment?	1.2009365669882572
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women, or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies?	1.1474599797444356
Obviously, the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds, the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy.	1.3562028903061116
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget.	1.1357114464074523
The aim of these regional policies, which, of course, are implemented under the jointly agreed European guidelines in each Member State, i.e. each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme, is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women.	1.2964517349196314
I should point out that 70% of funding for the period 2000-2006, i.e. EUR 195 billion, will go to the less-favoured regions of Europe.	1.07972113791399
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created, I would like to say, first, that there is, via the Social Fund, an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement, i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources.	1.3285189947987461
Secondly, the LEADER initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism, with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions.	1.2307431500085575
Commissioner, thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer, which has been rigorous and well-argued.	1.2269096810717872
However, I can assure you that we do not, with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions.	1.3775584717650513
They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation, where almost none exists.	1.3769119237255532
Therefore, my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits, which have brought results in cooperation, could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions, who have the odds stacked against them.	1.4314499011387993
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to.	1.2850273665348
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need.	1.232613030416979
With these forecasts of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development, we will not promote, as we should, employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions.	1.5906189138420936
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies.	0.8947653795875488
Question No 42 by (H-0817/99):	0.6265841841301621
Subject: Commission's plans for presentation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme, setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the 'social dialogue'.	1.2396732044697676
Can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme?	0.8883126715172587
We estimate that the Commission' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer.	1.273277408345874
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it, we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament, the social partners and non-governmental organisations.	1.3809044652461742
These discussions have already started, but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon.	1.3468247730195508
The Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society, economic policy and reforms.	1.2504114659021364
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission' s social programme.	1.1977442464077914
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission, after the Lisbon conference, so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be drafted.	1.4576905664900477
Clearly, any future social action programme should take account of developments, for example within information technology, and, in time, become a modern social action programme.	1.4032005331872037
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question, namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning, as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry?	1.3534396100137636
We need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements.	1.3180149907967291
Firstly, I agree with you entirely. Account will be taken of the information society; that was something which I too mentioned.	1.4618464378333929
Social exclusion, the programme for women, the efforts we are making in the social protection area, everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society.	1.4346601613267806
Secondly, there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented.	1.3787520262233341
Where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which, as you know, is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty.	1.33755018332228
Question No 44 by (H-0819/99):	0.6265841803526024
Subject: Opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, it should be possible for all EU citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union.	1.0807103542946594
However, for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance, freedom of movement is still highly restricted.	1.3922076806315384
What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area?	1.2010924996777776
On 26 November 1999, the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination.	1.3627382528780558
As far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned, there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination, especially in the workplace.	1.3076476881562462
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and, in the end, to promote the freedom of movement of these persons.	1.5420126150920643
Of course, it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport, services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement.	1.2138898052339198
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses, coaches and other vehicles, so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them.	1.0776456606121385
In addition, you should know that, on 4 June 1998, the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs, the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe.	1.4753909671842285
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer.	0.9675652200651835
My question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe.	1.1101350400039875
It is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage.	1.2358435915058874
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan.	1.2435973981928525
It is of course a prerequisite, however, that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability.	1.3006694816309123
It would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities, so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them.	1.3338995582127888
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport, so that people with special needs can use them.	1.2778418737435426
It has not yet been passed by the Council; it is at the consultation stage.	1.6547874438114807
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level.	1.4023979471980437
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport.	0.9334501661746166
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education, for young people, for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy.	1.330994428223179
Question No 45 by (H-0006/00):	0.7498385797031025
Subject: Compliance with Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark, even though the deadline has passed.	1.1142934407687044
The draft legislation before the Folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements.	0.8838945124351085
Pursuant to Article 3(8) of the Directive, terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the 'collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers' and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory'.	1.1369352766252365
However, such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis.	1.3393480741407062
There are therefore two possible solutions: either the Directive is inapplicable in Denmark, or Denmark is required by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreements.	1.1671238987101336
Can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in Denmark as far as 'collective agreements ... declared universally applicable' (cf. Article 3(1)) are concerned, given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law?	1.2594855049456375
If not, will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area?	1.5299398814534109
The European Union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country.	1.1146326391523118
What it says it that one of two things may apply, i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector.	1.1952700428517784
Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules, provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that, apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation, the hours in universally applicable collective agreements, concluded by the most representative organisations, also apply to posted workers.	1.201529717672409
In other words, to put it simply, Denmark has a choice: it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it.	1.3138293065355202
Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation.	1.4424493254332433
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply.	1.4004577227274302
We are waiting to see what the next move will be.	1.0243532517429
Thank you for a very clear answer, the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements.	1.3628282144150268
It is a very clear answer, but it is also an answer, may I point out, which puts Danish organisations, the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very, very difficult situation politically, for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model, which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements, and the Continental model, which presupposes legislation.	1.5454357644212764
The disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer, Commissioner, concern, first and foremost, another directive, namely the working time directive, but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings looming because the Danish Government does not intend, or has expressly stated that it does not wish, to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements.	1.2673186123082603
Firstly, no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country.	1.416842260646635
As I said earlier, there are always problems interpreting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another.	1.3123462134719244
As far as your question is concerned, this problem does not only apply to Denmark. It is not only Denmark which has matters pending.	1.3797031941960372
Five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage.	1.0761896298232543
What now needs to be done, and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the Commission and the Danish Government, and with other governments, is to find the best way forward, so that something which is decided at European level by all the Member States, and which constitutes a general framework, can also include workers posted to Denmark from other countries.	1.5524408101749378
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move.	1.401660141303359
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your dedication.	1.0422839045127097
You have fulfilled your objective for today, which is to answer all the questions.	1.3427989055205563
We congratulate you.	0.3465380164332319
Since the time allocated to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing.	0.9528865173858935
That concludes Question Time.	0.17283601513432983
(The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	0.4743843368100697
1997 discharge	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0004/2000) by Mrs van der Laan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1997 financial year (Section I - Parliament, II - Council, III - Commission, IV - Court of Justice and V - Court of Auditors) [SEC(1998) 520 - C4-0350/1998, SEC(1998) 522 - C4-0351/1998, SEC(1998) 519 - C4-0352/1999]	1.2622601415964552
The Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, is not here yet, but I hope, and expect, that she will arrive in the next few minutes.	1.7461134194361236
Nevertheless, I recommend that we start, in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate, and particularly the rapporteur' s speech, from her office, if that is where she still is.	1.568080880290942
Mr President, I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise.	1.351035804898492
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report, it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation.	1.2737312115232655
Mr President, early last year, the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future.	1.1761342224311868
In its resolution, this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious, far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission.	1.2596077894794777
This report, therefore, appears at a crucial time, on the eve of Mr Kinnock' s reforms.	1.278848859705419
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans.	1.284324723074733
In the period leading up to this, it already appeared, on the basis of the initial drafts, that the Commission had made very important pledges.	1.4740988990702129
We asked for a whistle-blower' s regulation, and this is now in place.	1.2865252036962047
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated.	0.7923037788956943
This has now been done.	0.7618954678847408
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets.	0.7127252603068898
This is in place too.	1.2264554719646819
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges.	1.041234851713193
It did this as well.	0.6406504883187688
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000.	1.1939676654926408
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices.	0.9206331002196345
These are sound, first steps which illustrate that, if this Parliament so wishes, changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly.	1.336317965220463
We want more than that, however.	1.2356572112151052
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme.	1.14964160384245
This is not only necessary for proper public administration, it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen.	1.3868488812971689
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points.	1.183088390243611
Firstly, Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents.	1.4241662844075265
This, however, presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents.	1.2550700399878567
In the context of providing information, I would like to draw the Commission' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents.	1.1733435752336059
If the current draft is correct, then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today.	1.3648171601528427
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not.	1.0850539169376356
Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents.	1.0673328139132576
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful.	1.0505273442630332
Furthermore, it should be the case that, if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running, the management should be held responsible for it, and this will have an effect on chances of promotion.	1.4644288814490993
Ultimately, we also need to achieve better cooperation, of course, between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts.	1.546992282118404
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year.	1.233081656643163
It should no longer be the case that, although Europe is an economic power, we have no political influence because, when the chips are down, we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it.	1.5614768173465232
I would quote Gaza as an example.	0.7951085702780264
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that, as yet, it has been left unused.	1.4777087343417175
Mr President, since 1996, the discharge has acquired a heavy, political significance.	1.4826509763833051
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care.	1.083862003412214
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow.	1.1332017921235173
However, we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place.	1.2073839342772634
Indeed, the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up.	1.2671670998240354
Finally, this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission. But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order.	1.447174987320263
As long as we have no status, we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union. The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe' s development process.	1.6104902977801776
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic.	1.1374337095624045
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe.	1.106064143857742
Mr President, the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so.	1.290234146902864
We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on, that is, by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers' money in Europe.	1.3375174737957491
During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget.	1.3307405755805115
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them.	0.8882735866025577
The first is a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programmes, particularly in third countries, without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing.	1.3241808356006333
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission, in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts.	1.1814501439234608
I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources.	1.3897255548497787
That cannot excuse everything that we came across.	0.7321492985674866
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so.	1.3305847684854177
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock.	1.4466641165158591
From what I have seen of the reform process, it looks good.	1.5036588883069941
I saw some of Mr Kinnock's papers today, I heard some of what he had to say.	1.3093881371820824
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need.	1.0789950616355715
But we need that reform process.	1.108721961280122
Many of the general points raised in our committee's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan's report.	1.0880203153448602
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it.	1.352792765155154
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports, a series of details.	1.1846364268520921
It groups them together and that is very important.	1.2001370803805202
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to.	1.0148644723195939
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe.	0.7133462624196848
We have to get this right.	1.127296928205139
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly.	1.0562796346110521
We have to remedy that.	1.1132066543463452
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms.	0.8938402327374052
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending.	1.1304643680613546
We need proper information, given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past.	1.4071268516157436
It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible.	1.3488085706463924
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and, at the same time, that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue.	1.3047182004996063
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored.	1.514873033140141
Mr President, I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which, as you are all so very well aware, led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission.	1.3224159759798413
The Socialist Group will be voting to grant discharge.	0.9467346744598913
I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well.	1.0177957846255348
But that is not to say that we are satisfied, and that everything in the garden is rosy.	1.4939691621291018
It is clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission is long overdue.	1.49007002139437
It indicates, however, that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction.	1.1554578499995598
I just want to outline some of the issues that we, as Socialists, have put down as amendments.	1.3314573494461035
We hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform.	1.3774429914816968
First of all, the immunity of officials: this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor.	1.161341823576329
We need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption.	1.0494944530387174
It is critical to note that the Commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the Court of Auditors.	1.1492298888656365
The Court's report is there for a reason, our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through.	1.410213065056684
I have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the Commission.	1.1956079069486765
Even if we hear nothing else, we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see.	1.5116926537767044
Too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them.	1.2514570228411033
We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future.	1.3044161381460053
The other issue is access to confidential documents.	0.6755885992581645
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had.	1.5716678654881133
We understand that we also have a responsibility here, that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential.	1.4110252956270364
We have put down an amendment to that effect.	1.067653059760931
One issue which is referred to in the van der Laan report is the whole question of the Gaza hospital.	1.2888569423365444
The situation there is totally unacceptable.	0.6740021801646361
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue.	1.2376616163944199
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan.	1.1986569472911808
I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks.	1.1880905670451036
Mr President, Commissioner, if we are honest, we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation.	1.3153647489084637
We are discussing last year' s discharge, but also the Commission' s responsibility.	1.4443553667970537
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks.	1.2384810634577803
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed.	1.0933026579077592
It is about a Commission which is no more.	1.3350078623409962
There is now a new Commission.	0.8790268548317802
Then it is logical to grant discharge, because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned?	1.2528961473189055
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts.	0.6602134394331601
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission' s good intentions, but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions.	1.3671147401947412
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month.	0.7375486015144009
We are all very much anticipating this, but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge.	1.4499261822892278
It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled.	1.3568261450742856
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed.	1.1890248441105553
Take, for example, the pledges made by the Commission. They look good in themselves.	1.3385534618762074
I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them.	1.175653815932871
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome: the public nature and confidentiality of documents.	1.4976166346949922
The previous speaker already said something about this.	0.9246914110095168
A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level, but at a high level within the Commission - which, instead of enhancing the public nature of documents, is having the opposite effect.	1.4355472157817881
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results.	1.032050893146029
This also applies to whistle-blowers.	0.6159249737527729
Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but, at the same time, it is entirely unclear, at this moment when we have to make a decision, what, for example, happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament.	1.348722421212243
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type.	0.8553034718030348
So there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made.	1.2616622479312143
This also applies, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced.	1.5192054883755552
In my opinion, the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management, but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general, empty proposals.	1.3774297698327616
At the moment, our group still feels sympathy for, and patience with, the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past, but this patience has a limit.	1.4863844600077905
Clear progress must be visible.	0.4128254758906471
At present, we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so.	1.5168178028755919
Finally, Mr President, the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission.	1.4372275847479732
I express the hope that - in fact, I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission. Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value.	1.5964412349024868
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge, the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997.	1.476336395099822
In our Group, we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996.	1.2422043646882568
In that year, we voted against granting discharge.	1.294227709865065
As a result, we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997, too.	1.1466490988994078
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors.	1.0969697952987683
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised.	0.8494386280526803
So far, the promises which have been made are still, however, to be fulfilled, especially where transparency is concerned.	1.5207652275163386
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution, but against the granting of discharge.	1.3293966017902314
Mr President, first of all, I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der Laan' s very expert work on this report.	1.2486967383622216
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997.	0.7912518676720003
The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts.	1.0366453205800839
We support these critical remarks, and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd, against this background, to vote in favour of approving the accounts.	1.2583028811409618
It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful, and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we, as Members of this Parliament, were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned.	1.257650197156628
The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission' s implementing a series of reforms, so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission' s period of office is not repeated.	1.2353803018148435
Again, I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission' s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission' s accountability for the future.	1.4273060777905564
We do not think that the new Commission, under any circumstances, could incur liability for the past.	1.6181290933908827
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission' s liability as an institution.	1.3780863940283579
The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time, and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better.	1.2716687864128093
By means of this extraordinary procedure, Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs, namely with the previous Commission.	1.1968212715569215
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission, and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating.	1.4170643297503087
There is no reason why, against this background, we should agree to grant discharge.	1.2757821751390905
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned, we shall abstain from voting, and where, finally, the motion for a resolution is concerned, we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it.	1.4133811074950686
Mr President, the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission, to whom it was to be granted, had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity.	1.2611719707639235
Mrs van der Laan' s report - on which she has lavished a great deal of hard work, and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997.	1.4462686908379327
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor' s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year, 1996, was denied.	1.3971316590710037
That is just the way things are, however.	1.2079602748338603
In taking over the mandate, the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made.	1.4022057078016414
Since, on account of the college system, discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or, alternatively, denied or postponed, it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belonged to the previous Commission that has yet to be discharged, crop up again as Members of this body.	1.2469147951577684
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed.	1.1683566611657128
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control' s proposal this week and grants discharge, then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque.	1.5732059807007193
For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan' s report that is the most important, to my mind, namely the motion for a resolution.	1.4156241899224091
The comments contained within, under eight headings, are an integral part of the discharge, the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision.	1.3805936510476304
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997.	1.3888120201962626
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme.	1.3016282412465086
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency, transparency and accountability, and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information, are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority.	1.1948693041478302
Mr President, we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform.	1.1514314836974633
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures.	1.2292515942741709
It is fair to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament.	1.4086569697062197
However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives.	1.494346261065635
Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure, for example, that the enlargement process can succeed.	1.2919253209785104
I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate.	1.0562299643466841
But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reformed, it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission.	1.3906778703676321
Mr President, the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997, but in reality it does not deserve it.	1.4134004549122647
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability.	1.594562245077373
It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission' s remit. The new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals, and I must admit that I am not impressed at all.	1.3979366844032735
The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one' s friends unfortunately still exists.	0.8199159534516157
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start. I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly.	1.351549254322857
I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO.	0.9874983477493723
I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter.	1.1242823581245724
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information.	1.4155432249450866
From the outside, it looks as if the Commission has something to hide.	1.4077777132814555
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case.	0.8265223681929136
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission.	1.1518286322239668
It was this practice which led to the Commission' s downfall.	1.2389252872501528
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents. Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work.	1.1690853935783134
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	0.888918349451551
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.1800861409464389
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts	0.879506399386399
The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission.	1.0917105106021983
Mr President, this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud, nepotism and corruption in the European Commission.	1.410456416240537
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility".	1.1105053427504574
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team.	1.057840226740968
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal.	1.0934501386944357
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new, reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office.	1.1425557422634152
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.	1.2146230035608374
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function.	1.1763916687359084
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted.	0.7667150629832614
In a symbolic but significant gesture Commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol, tobacco, petrol and consumer goods.	0.8831393939021646
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials.	0.9125864248476814
The number of departments has been reduced.	0.7856368199141396
The Commission, in my opinion, has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated.	1.288504419613769
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong, honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential.	1.210041017216198
In order to achieve this, action is required in four areas.	1.1939552125085842
First, financial management and control within the Commission must be improved.	1.347125010157615
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control.	1.1229909968487612
The Commission's DGs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure, including financial control.	1.4100117844768403
A new independent audit system service must be set up.	0.8327666659486692
DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities.	0.9874393785548862
In return for this greater degree of autonomy, managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions.	0.9781915636405742
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time.	1.1330522428666838
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes.	1.2154389238293377
But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase, this must not be an excuse for inertia.	1.7202193303743996
Urgent change is required today.	0.6229020619895232
Second, the fight against fraud, mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened, firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive.	1.2144275428864724
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly, by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud.	1.2583394940519068
OLAF, the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts, criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the Union by Members and officials of the European institutions.	1.361867614549491
A proposal can be made, a proposal should be made, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, by the middle of this year.	1.370658948715868
Third, standards in European public life must be upheld.	0.9781471239218119
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct.	1.1330201357301664
A number of codes have since been introduced.	0.7977495895622594
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding.	1.07685776281366
The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries, most notably the United Kingdom, and institute a committee for standards in public life, with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions.	1.3628834176581939
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected.	0.8164639058874575
At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers.	0.8933460943254984
They must be implemented without delay.	0.702517895973881
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.	1.1951440851192678
Crucially, reforms must not be limited to the Commission.	1.0132835263662903
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules, administrative procedures and management practices.	0.9371612717515907
Finally, the Commission's human resource policy must be modernised.	1.6251858440970937
It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern, multinational organisation.	1.0723782626500298
The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue.	0.7934397870194281
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive.	1.3914766919502137
Too many young, new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years.	1.0868179379259546
Merit must be recognised and rewarded, specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade.	1.113291338331481
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent.	0.80621306145664
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed.	0.8115801503127297
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions.	0.881296224671734
It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders, or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States.	1.3002410113379954
Commissioner Kinnock will, tomorrow, present his communication on reform.	0.9131599230145248
This communication must contain a clear timetable.	0.6898064976590654
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be.	1.075881004835004
Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away.	1.5149742575592313
Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility.	1.3120405399153956
In June of last year Europe's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism.	0.8947952739572272
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories.	1.279918923245588
Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism.	0.7499802770045254
Mr President, I do not want to be misunderstood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am, of course, in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate, necessary reforms.	1.4352353548001964
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about.	1.4580276179218716
All the experts can provide information and news, formulate opinions and give advice, but, they have no political or elective responsibility, and rightly so.	1.1775293234180635
I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which, on some occasions, I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive.	1.3698784955760561
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone, and no one else, can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case, the European Parliament' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward, as it should.	1.5259329691593426
It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation.	1.3302547895221548
Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality, discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately, and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else.	1.0602167893333472
I would point out that there is no European legal system, but that a different legal system exists in each Member State.	1.3927474248041805
We run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways.	0.9731379897544776
I agree that an investigation system should be introduced, but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and, in any case, the equal need for the right to a defence.	1.5367824042571725
I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat: whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium.	0.9388461026220083
In conclusion, Mr President, Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy: we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers, not go into reverse.	1.4673663470148544
This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957.	1.3932748664480326
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself, are now part of European folklore.	1.5433044148759338
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated.	1.1573452205543144
Remember that the Council of Ministers, absent again this evening from our debate, approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March.	1.4298125601101215
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September.	1.0605182491792402
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored.	1.3514464988621222
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials.	1.2507122465928622
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months, which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency.	1.2055139050567016
We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly.	1.140264529736549
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly, it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode.	1.2754495797814303
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information.	1.2231787612204152
This was, after all, one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission.	0.997377335863774
Have the lessons not been learnt?	0.6906202975715968
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee.	1.4233731885251073
We could, in no way, agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package.	1.3496707265159755
The less precise, Mr van Hulten, we are in our resolutions, the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like.	1.6677377026066895
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men' s report should be implemented.	1.0834300966417436
We have, as the EPP-ED group, submitted all the recommendations of the Wise Men' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report, entirely changing the nature of the van Hulten report in committee.	1.2146403736735467
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee, in particular, our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you, Commissioner, accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct, particularly when considering appointments and promotion.	1.3403003721384237
Looking to the future, we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission.	1.6179426484065602
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.	1.1986840802255774
Commissioner, you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred.	1.450178764566486
In a nutshell: there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available.	1.1267602938188284
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible.	1.4732112394826804
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget.	0.9019304287036889
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions.	1.2243584952719353
But, equally, we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination.	1.0689122086558787
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform.	1.2216871108784246
Mr President, I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation.	1.2226144085870012
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report.	0.9204060856267763
It is an excellent report.	0.8185262062319903
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues.	1.0355224225588284
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced.	1.294677924013656
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse.	0.8237125282516992
Yes, a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet, and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow.	1.3353477319088864
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far.	1.1575010250794244
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change.	1.172060977163911
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility.	1.1382087425522909
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission.	1.17741311779459
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation.	1.277680582865897
That is important.	0.3906482444523105
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another.	0.9908499042929608
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible.	1.2038793668780545
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal.	0.9625927596960486
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.	1.2557121685581027
We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence, mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service.	1.0120754607442513
I will give you one example of this.	0.7709035298584325
In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million.	0.9922801211697124
It is clear that is not acceptable.	1.5675806760833702
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation?	0.9538142714734467
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit.	1.3414709411086922
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working.	1.2505023384893985
But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated.	1.0075001530739127
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March.	1.239527422558484
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones.	1.0299076995119805
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history.	1.1907276841883867
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves.	1.3174128931566182
Our own staff policy is outdated.	0.6195941945342813
Some of our working practices need radical reform.	0.8833938534045691
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process.	1.402999626288091
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting.	0.9747456179731188
We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities.	1.3498066958096262
Finally, can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public.	1.6013499064729975
European taxpayers need to be re-assured.	0.876746532260324
The fate of the Commission, of the whole European Union, rests on delivery of this reform.	1.3627916865587013
That is the key issue, delivery of these proposals.	1.3620767439978332
Mr President, I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, on his first report.	1.1424286531309897
I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments.	1.0499068370430107
I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run.	1.4793021048918233
We have submitted an amendment to this effect.	0.9521323098154182
From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report, I would like to highlight a few, not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly.	1.2834170967314
Firstly, I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents.	1.4657368088320615
The Commission' s records leave a great deal to be desired.	0.9887291258525389
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair, which, as it happens, has still not been sorted out.	1.2660491993085123
Curiously, very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets, even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General, and this is clearly something which should not happen.	1.4461757061511142
If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections, these documents must be available, and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation.	1.297924242772974
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control.	0.8649422720068657
This has also been partly dealt with in the van Hulten report. I think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented.	1.2982436107606836
The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad.	0.9360413798556824
It is clear that, over the past couple of years, we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure.	1.1292976637498031
Is this possible?	0.3456875339343949
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out.	1.175365155048206
If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first.	0.9002026583682827
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten.	1.0581825025672995
It is his first report here in plenary.	0.7549480377828925
This is worth a compliment although I regret, of course, that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue.	1.199105746337542
It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late.	1.0862596543306862
In my opinion, this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control.	1.2407114162075714
Let us be honest.	0.671196918478089
The second report of the Wise Men arrived in September.	0.6568739758646708
We are now four months down the line.	0.9570979665815814
Meanwhile, Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments, more than 100 amendments in the first round.	1.4663985920024223
He went back to work, rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions, but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round.	1.255193034834624
My fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed, too extensive and too late.	1.4248222420398153
Moreover, I have been informed that the Commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the Commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament, I hope.	1.6319602298678304
Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening?	1.0588014480586574
Mr van Hulten, my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon' s plenary meeting to embellish this report.	1.1936270475135962
After all, it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report.	1.1831057154930769
So tomorrow, if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs, this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable.	1.3478703397463856
In any case, it should be clear that my group, of course, fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men.	1.2485433821769434
In any event, I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today.	1.2999906739019682
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February.	1.280040564928146
I have to inform you, Commissioner, that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group, gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not.	1.3692161052033227
I would like to end on the following point. Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated, we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission.	1.3842943643609062
I think that there is a need for this, as public opinion is looking for change and, in any event, my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002.	1.4505325970642367
Mr President, this report is positive but, actually, we need more than this.	1.709932059831226
Fraud, mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere.	0.843988377343118
They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow.	1.0071040403123726
Via the structural funds, a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system.	1.3815828211771082
This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States.	1.2891708687851142
But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States.	1.373830295290524
Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating.	1.0807401881048244
After each incident of improper use of this money, and certainly after fraud, the call for stricter control is more pronounced.	1.224245800059923
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem.	0.6583296424506963
It will, at best, lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects.	1.0791015479736203
It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour.	1.0467206794257025
In the next couple of years, we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population.	1.1183768302164172
This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud, less overheads, more transparency and more democracy.	1.2328708913026871
Mr President, a year has not yet passed, but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently.	1.483743697942045
The first report was widely publicised, formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat, first of the President of the Commission, and then of the majority of the European Commissioners, even though they had no connection with fraud, mismanagement or nepotism.	1.5115319468316837
Reading now what happened then, not even a year ago, it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform, as is maintained today, so much so that this second report - which, on the other hand, could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases, since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report.	1.3905193442245651
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, nor to the majority of the trade unions, who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration, but, in practice, are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members, putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use.	1.390212889439915
Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee, thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state.	1.0919467567173418
Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk.	1.370742809759464
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates, discussions and the exchange of information.	1.3126393034171635
Mr President, when it comes to putting its own house in order, the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation.	1.4752723137319985
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.	1.0148758754641876
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound, the more applause they receive.	1.365440795230448
There again, it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen, and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks.	1.4625787589410335
This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue.	1.0470120992693357
Nevertheless, the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see, and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report.	1.2797308210619185
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points.	1.4316528669305288
Allow me to start with the most important demand.	1.1506137390582
We do not want financial control to be abolished.	1.1730933050340921
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made, not in every case, but wherever uncertainties or risks arise.	1.3111297528296302
The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here, by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits, for example.	1.2501802665515256
It may well be easy enough to change the Commission' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts, particularly those relating to budgetary discipline.	1.3464019166278998
I do not have exact figures, but the Community' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller, to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office.	1.406605072402541
This cannot be ignored or evaded, certainly not on account of soft law, as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee.	1.1812447931016312
Irrespective of such legal considerations, it would be an unforgivable mistake, under the circumstances, to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are, at long last, no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms.	1.266945393694987
As we see it, there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future: a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller, concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up, and finally, there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF, the new anti-fraud office.	1.3426859606004369
It is to be welcomed that Mr van Hulten' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie, which must be tackled.	1.283806993006823
A few salient points: the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect, especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours, including those of a financial nature.	1.2445616697798894
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned, and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague.	1.4400517410877978
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked.	1.2166346720130152
Mr President, firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague, Mr van Hulten.	1.284926218702728
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am, I think, entitled to feel a little proud of him.	1.399254011561546
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report.	1.348739641858895
Mr President, the Commission' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy.	1.1060511278839507
The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one.	1.1489204766111798
I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent. Sometimes, an enormous reservoir of money is created, not because it is not desperately needed, not because there are no sound proposals, but because the whole system has collapsed.	1.4648486844102957
A lack of responsibility, too much ex ante, not enough ex post and, as a result, far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending.	1.3466340995187038
It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind, with all the work organised on that basis.	1.20702988599695
When the Commission' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March, I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change.	1.365785259876158
Without any doubt, this will then be a service, Mr President, to the European public and, by means of the results we produce, we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years.	1.5945732631123049
This is the best support we can give to European democracy.	1.411350997475563
If, in this way, we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century, we are witnessing a very special moment indeed.	1.3551294804952003
Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Michiel van Hulten for his first report.	0.9886812191642456
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time.	1.3189802138360975
Mr van Hulten, I think you deserve a medal for your efforts.	1.3172781985623792
There are two points which, in my opinion, deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR.	1.0353760818337505
Firstly, there is the Commissioners' individual responsibility.	1.2706973091007745
This must be regulated during the IGC.	0.960356265925287
However, we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have, therefore, submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council.	1.4102056571242898
Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleague, Mr Mulder, the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts.	1.5495284561377543
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution.	1.2033171063250545
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well.	1.1549205936908968
Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open, democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve.	1.1918733652741915
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House.	1.3065368402674689
I am sure that it will serve, amongst other things, to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups.	1.235373000949715
At this stage, there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission, demanded by our citizens.	1.1052237431395457
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed, even by its Presidents.	1.2744468733301202
It now appears that this desire is more serious.	0.8600732774075398
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies, it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised, on 14 September, to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February.	1.3738450908864202
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme.	0.5726922249193235
The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts commissioned by this Parliament.	1.2640057945925152
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway, that he preferred to get things right, but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting.	1.3206698283025524
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and, if it is, I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process.	1.5450981073027168
We want a strong Commission, which can act in an independent and neutral manner, but with political sense.	1.5711111463240157
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office.	0.8976594047559645
Therefore, the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties.	1.382424755477701
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise.	0.7234804724156008
I do not know your exact view in this respect, Mr Kinnock, but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed.	1.342998131957943
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively, and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present.	1.4363431442684484
Therefore, Commissioner, we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme, and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat, but not with this Parliament, which expects profound and daring changes.	1.4883909306943266
Mr President, the Santer Commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line.	0.951069405060441
Therefore, the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order.	1.3038906696994343
As far as this is concerned, a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis, with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future.	1.2682713987662382
Naturally, this is only to be welcomed.	1.7555689676153172
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price, as it were, that is, of having to dispense with independent - and I stress, independent - prior approval.	1.4714667536679906
Up until now, the Commission' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa.	1.1682772977548301
And so it is the "two key" principle that applies here.	1.1982739345330409
A single key is to suffice in future.	0.6918476637542263
The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks, if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission.	1.274791886115939
If you will pardon me for saying so, Mr Kinnock, what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes.	1.3992261824655472
What we really need to focus on, however, is making the checks more effective.	1.1839839219164248
This could be achieved by no longer insisting, in future, that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp.	1.3233236180021983
It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all.	1.1476479253221892
Therefore, in future, prior approval should take place in a targeted manner, that is, only in cases of uncertainty or risk.	1.4200181854445733
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis, that is, in the operational Directorates-General, amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money, so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.	1.1585276138781793
However, the financial controllers must work independently.	1.4871934472008248
That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission, when it talks in terms of decentralisation.	1.4030574439107775
It is obviously the Commission' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General, but this is precisely what we do not want.	1.4881397093304245
Surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair, when the internal examiners in the relevant Directorate-General issued warnings, but these were neither heeded nor passed on.	1.2331766721159936
Therefore, independence is prerequisite for effective checks.	1.0164171844525032
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to.	1.3910968172136335
Indeed, the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?	1.39693512041536
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow' s vote.	1.212710442757346
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard.	1.195356425739234
Mr President, a couple of years ago, the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures.	1.4929841194112754
This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions, whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise.	0.8501852489767375
This was stupid of the old Commission, and Parliament was of no help on that occasion.	1.3504109208218207
When I read Mr van Hulten' s passage about personnel policy, I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air.	1.150514196467347
There are too many rights, too many regulations and too little room for leadership.	1.1793168650358674
There is no backbone, and no teeth.	1.612354260940334
Where is the beef?	0.3112466502145991
And I would also say this to you, Commissioner: please, deliver the beef even if it is British.	1.3854626681463642
Romano Prodi promised a revolution.	0.3973091543102199
You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself, but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues, the ones where it hurts!	1.3134045753346733
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances.	0.6659936975208048
Stand firm on the demand for mobility, not as a right, as it says here in the report, but as a management tool.	1.4884036924538218
Ensure too, that training becomes a management tool.	1.145571200329244
Do not listen to the report' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed.	1.1618598741982684
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis.	1.0810406553455387
Finally, Mr President, as a member of the Bureau until six months ago, I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply, in our own administration, with the demands we are making on others.	1.5718152885089223
We have not done this so far, and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing.	1.3164510994978063
Mr President, I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it.	1.4026303449876891
So I refer to the things I do not agree with.	1.0267604363931089
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament.	1.007136158521689
This report is about the Commission.	1.272593722008809
Parliament is a separate subject.	0.9483656276126137
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission.	1.1635898394587227
In addition to that, there is the question of duty-free.	1.1433049701539553
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports.	1.0928767866993245
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either.	1.2410363847235375
Most of the report is about financial control.	1.4102012423504022
That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee.	0.8908411638746362
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission.	1.2492568848112449
After all, it is only 1% of GDP, by comparison with national spending.	1.3953488859879912
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States.	1.2960362340871971
So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money.	1.1490847603874497
We should get it into perspective.	0.7987942989682317
It is important to remember that.	0.8326801270093604
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money.	1.529632357965722
They have very little of it.	0.6765157064161305
They have a much wider responsibility.	0.9819852200127129
That wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment, food safety, foreign trade, the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them.	1.181005266033722
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.	1.3317153311855252
If there is, we have generated it in this House in the past year.	1.7098138591899754
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.	1.3483137567668828
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted, doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs.	1.2902709816553304
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were.	1.127651155612894
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it.	1.3224805163778055
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement, for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far.	1.5541426155292293
Mr President, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report.	1.250565053946107
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work.	1.3624008824578033
The process of reform has been going on for some time, and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the Commission.	1.313013166583305
The Commission' s administration simply does not function particularly well.	0.9985034327558774
Naturally, there are good, capable employees in the Commission, and they are in the majority. But we need radical reform.	1.6473255923114685
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy.	1.0181918285042162
People should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable.	1.1405787226506632
The Financial Regulation should be amended.	0.9993090807529769
We agree that we should have better control of the finances.	1.2627081360079362
It is just a question of how.	1.2921184323395496
The Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control.	1.1653132170096334
We should be careful about this.	0.9893646382213156
We should retain some form of ex ante financial control.	0.5389191682091036
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent.	1.1277919852575369
This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through.	0.8638108079807068
Instead, we should be reforming and decentralising control.	1.2203012985619421
The Commission does not have enough staff.	1.0318762425194357
As Members of the European Parliament, we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it.	1.3618466732310066
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs.	1.1516278307087362
The staffing system is too rigid.	0.6772345743833521
There should be a more frequent rotation of employees, especially at the top of the hierarchy.	1.0989768415686358
It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees.	0.7714293948020495
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed.	1.1936482583483983
After all, the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms.	1.2384827205201332
Mr President, Commissioners, first of all, I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is, on the whole, a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned.	1.3366221600645867
Perhaps this is a little worrying.	1.4349343051946597
I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.	1.4039617029315705
We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner, only then to have to rush again to put out the next one. As Mr Blak said, we must instead establish a system with clear roles.	1.4352007909948068
First of all, we need tough regulations, which can be implemented.	1.4415629705536548
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough.	0.5945587922765646
There need to be tough rules stating, among other things, what may be decentralised, what may be outsourced and what is independent.	1.119602728137478
I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised.	1.2711797844794883
What we need, then, are basic administrative regulations for the EU, for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States.	1.5435440627988568
These are what are missing.	0.7676733650964772
We have asked for a Public Prosecutor' s Office and criminal law, but we also need administrative law for the EU.	1.3085657768276873
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt, as binding regulations, the ombudsman' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice.	1.4356146802287297
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.	0.9294061074345523
Secondly, we must also clarify our own auditing roles.	1.3118126642219052
The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action.	1.1998597081017361
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation.	1.8607600890874127
We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF' s job.	1.2394100473580643
Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents.	1.1363268064119438
Obstinate as I am, I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet. Otherwise, we shall not get anywhere in this fight.	1.3364733896000753
Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report.	1.3177709717449315
I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch, now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so. Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this.	1.2297109312394572
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments.	1.3509527733750084
I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic.	1.1561710423652236
I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments.	1.4193625659810987
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective.	1.3455676870005395
Mr President, one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is, to my mind, the rapporteur' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration.	1.579569679912194
A very important proposal indeed.	0.9196904092993239
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan, because she wants to scrap it altogether.	1.3525051102650432
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale.	0.667971818474862
On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes.	1.3397440970786716
I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock, but I happen to know Mr Kinnock.	1.3167790018224008
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary.	1.021515759911676
In my opinion, such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary.	0.9982371882449177
Finally, the issue of officials.	1.2323225948890684
Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder' s view.	1.2172137267547571
I do agree that the section on officials has, in fact, been completed totally inadequately.	1.2068165215331021
First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised. Secondly, all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement.	1.3743521138085781
For example, we are currently looking into TAOs. This is a key point but, at the same time, we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission.	1.4000016181601216
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.	1.2073824430456697
Mr President, ever since Plato' s 'Republic' , the Western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts.	1.2626438667137903
Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine, themselves, what its future should be.	1.2459061161246863
In this second report, the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in Parliament, which may have hesitated to remove the European Commission from office, since they shared the political affiliations of some of its members.	1.4261670939466073
The experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the Commissioners from belonging to political groups.	1.0899737927641036
According to the experts, Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission. This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life, and this should be a standing committee, not elected, presumably made up of another group of experts.	1.4347747567586049
In this, their second report, the experts tell us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund, that the ERDF and the Social Fund represent two-thirds of the Structural Funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the Structural Funds come to the same thing. They tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the EAGGF-Guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the Commission and to the Member States.	1.3836531787342512
This lesson in wisdom is 100% ideology and 0% knowledge.	0.7161646936198587
This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions.	1.3054048823223636
The van Hulten report started out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieved.	1.1018227853342553
Unfortunately, it was then changed, and changed for the worse, which turned it into a document which in fact, proposes something that we cannot accept.	1.6595699836821132
Mr President, Mr van Hulten, your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising, arduous and complex, and I believe this is important in a first report.	1.3421440271152205
Please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate, and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer.	1.342359566676179
This report seems to me to be redundant, long-winded, confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used.	0.9831113696970594
Perhaps 'redundant' is the most serious epithet, and you are not responsible for this. It is the responsibility of this Parliament.	1.5860132322105198
That is to say, if this Parliament commissions a Committee of Experts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Casaca has said, but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem, where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on, ad infinitum.	1.3614767852689613
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission, we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them.	1.5602087162386191
Meanwhile, we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence.	1.5980505304056467
'Long-winded' .	0.521843129166721
I am not going to mention the length of this report.	0.9899971237736747
I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but, for this type of resolution it certainly does.	1.4400803856405475
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop.	1.4772294333953344
It is also 'confusing' .	1.0872834010802357
I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament.	1.0355377507851353
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue, but not in this report.	1.4161930578069175
And finally, Mr President, frankly, I am not going to give examples, but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy.	1.3688395907006286
Therefore - in summary - I await, and many of us await, your report, Commissioner Kinnock, so that we can really express our opinion on it, which is the duty of this Parliament.	1.61843307077428
Mr President, the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are.	1.22034428786582
When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though, it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them.	1.2050836445364619
Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control.	0.925063157682216
The concept of transparency stands out in the report.	0.7956759388744412
Securing this is a major priority.	1.3554230566729133
The importance of smooth-running, comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough.	0.8086513209947379
This is not just about bureaucratic reform, however; rather, it is about showing good will towards the citizens.	1.4591168573578859
We must win back their faith in EU politics.	0.6941902121050809
The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them.	1.0824598243142742
This is what enables them to understand what is going on.	1.137750969849171
They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served	1.178673469785622
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the Commission' s own initiative.	1.3841602796815395
However, it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis.	1.4188560646140949
However, Mr Kinnock, your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather, as Parliamentarians, we want, and must, play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week, before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control.	1.444707695088997
I believe, Mr Kinnock, that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level, the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations.	1.4440629134353227
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission's - it was the decision of this Parliament!	1.485333132812168
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House.	0.8423459307143659
She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House, there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full, formally and in detail for everything I have done.	1.2971956302540981
Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report.	1.303901689302134
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance, as several Members have said, to all of our Institutions.	1.3541363991865054
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative.	1.1445617748779184
Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence.	1.5054441794617592
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary.	1.4411425409864056
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission's reform proposals.	1.4912456807479744
Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today, well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago.	1.181800453788648
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that.	0.9748546853973341
The great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform.	1.311618014842634
There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile.	1.231656463090191
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance.	1.236514057771385
I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode.	1.2168349470965583
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing.	1.5349112946147276
Hence the transmission.	0.3297873845324176
Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.	1.4193144878392687
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.	1.206049268583884
The need for transparency is rightly stressed, not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does.	1.3835766202427777
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable, not just to this House, but more generally to the European public.	1.4592284759083065
Naturally, sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information, but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible.	1.2942917711796247
I have repeatedly emphasised that, indeed not just as a Commissioner, but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning.	1.4693112060091584
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.	1.1122952828804098
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform.	0.9343985441695608
As the House knows and has repeatedly said, the scale and scope of the Union's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures.	1.2140725588502561
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today's debate.	1.0587236622741794
We share the view, forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts, and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures.	1.3792904122698015
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April.	1.4010013384003508
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital.	0.8052953771456454
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law.	1.2464914090150816
Change in the law is fundamental.	0.8266120755209456
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy, but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system.	1.3051827959054667
Essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget.	1.3873786501444927
In addition, and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system, the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - "the second key" as Herr Bösch said, established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts.	1.5184444893367874
That service will open on 1 May this year.	0.7929751520921893
It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation.	1.2118041723639095
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening.	1.174746096640581
As Budgets Commissioner, here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors.	1.2865257695360417
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits.	1.0249715885602941
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them.	1.0486047036954436
The proposed change will make the systems more effective, both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes.	0.9500383107728304
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called "a big bang approach".	1.318751300843547
Financial control' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate.	1.0610011545167
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts.	1.1358951823982528
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa.	0.9565074407104714
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control.	0.910099261228419
In addition, I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997.	1.204154001569672
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson' s comments to this House last month. "The Commission's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation.	1.4195282600244359
For instance, the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered.	1.1825321671299698
At the same time, the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies, notably the same Financial Controller, the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General."	1.2327999313965008
The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but, over the years, it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions.	1.1064934278544443
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this.	1.0666999427660024
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition.	1.0075062539208535
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document.	1.0558440853580295
Our objective, the committee' s objective, the Court of Auditors' objective is not to abolish financial control, it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control.	1.5080947782335372
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months.	1.3271125593172863
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud, corruption, mismanagement and nepotism: the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing.	1.145888522681835
As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions, we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed.	1.2743668801035153
Since June of last year, the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities.	0.9232923362234748
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line.	0.9801451953012289
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.	0.8804587698554659
We are seeking to implement best practice.	0.7621328602750804
Serious response to reports, confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure.	0.8922865244491817
As a corollary, there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations.	1.0984098362453074
A communication later this year will give full details.	0.750554227246416
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose.	1.386553465643594
I am persuaded, however, by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability.	1.2330544279355322
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness, fairness, consistency and professionalism.	0.9956472452054996
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament.	1.4762693152073354
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change.	0.9995289134746185
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House.	1.201477239274661
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework.	1.025596693740657
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life.	1.2512505944617176
That is in line with the draft resolution.	0.9353897825436032
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions.	1.2192025284578654
I welcome Parliament's support for that.	0.699372170487434
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents, made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten's report.	1.1278989639971717
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission's accountability to this Parliament.	1.1344861328015587
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission's practical commitment to that.	1.1425947240198369
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents.	1.216713997091391
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors.	0.9605362735340561
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament.	1.225330821843976
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text.	1.016743064857345
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible.	0.9819151431885955
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform.	0.9456580484046342
I am glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment, training, appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals.	1.2708463725925034
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions.	0.9698507234216969
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities.	0.7942345705426702
Members, who, in the course of this debate, have properly praised Commission officials, who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity, hard-working and of great capability, are absolutely right in the comments that they have made.	1.4096954490769742
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points, detail and precision are obviously essential.	0.9819036766557033
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months.	0.7285796691073035
Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House.	1.0379529575307296
It is, meanwhile, very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament, as an institution, on central matters of common interest, notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations.	1.4181557274756802
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay, conditions, staff representation rights and so on, but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters.	1.0954053696161323
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome.	0.9163426268037842
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change.	1.0279557169933964
That is most certainly relevant.	0.6635338824244502
We are sure that there will be an important "reform dividend" as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources.	1.22731099125331
It is very clear, however, that parts of the Commission services are already very stretched.	1.5227085069181308
Parliament has frequently made that point.	0.5780449437011017
Secondly, it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology.	1.2391194574292572
Thirdly, it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken.	1.368268862633752
They are already having implications for resource availability.	0.7163916215418921
It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called "negative priorities" and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity.	1.388790357093462
A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management.	1.1446553331445932
I want to emphasise, however, that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission, it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission.	1.407230789171677
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten's report.	0.7307362752748126
I conclude, Mr President, by thanking the House for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions.	1.3954622571627306
We look forward to working closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then, most important of all, working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities.	1.3306225665118558
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.1800861409464389
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)	0.5165985455573522
Middle East peace process (continuation)	0.7586772407632388
The next item is the continuation of the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East peace process.	1.114309037617879
I am very grateful to the President of the Council for the statement this morning on the Middle East at the beginning of this debate and for hearing some of Minister Gama' s insights, as he arrived hot-foot from the region.	1.3614119111800251
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East, even though, as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki.	1.2412902433080315
Such is life.	0.34653193999911286
I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would, in all normal circumstances, wish to do.	1.3544668898960701
The debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis I had arranged to see visitors from the Balkans this evening.	1.0745653324347202
So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion.	1.0594748492000854
It is not something, I assure you, which I would wish to make a practice of.	1.8654430141911977
Like honourable Members, I welcome the United States' efforts that have relaunched the Syrian/Israeli negotiations, despite the Syrian decision that they needed more time before resuming the talks that were scheduled to start again today.	1.1824012451038268
There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future. I also hope that progress in the Syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of Lebanese/Israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel's relations with its northern neighbours.	1.1880237421314144
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track.	1.189935057720969
The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict.	1.1818830177548278
A fair and, indeed, generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East.	1.0572223352447878
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.	0.7330407032630469
Although there has been some slippage, I trust that the remaining Israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon.	1.1800332828564828
Similarly, despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework Agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid-February deadline, I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached.	1.2159691519985363
I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat, when they met on Monday.	1.2568316298225366
Honourable Members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track.	1.125668560934173
This is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible, in close liaison with the US and Russian co-sponsors as well as the regional parties.	1.44563552933312
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development.	0.9443601124796724
The beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month.	1.2863739463922959
I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again.	0.954096164113664
The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process, as all sides - Palestinians, Israelis, their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged.	1.3484393190682682
Nor is our role confined to that of banker.	0.960904581979827
We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region.	1.1130852775504636
But we should not kid ourselves: a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag.	1.1109807778753331
The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments.	1.4255821353963596
We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon.	1.2836595656326015
But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process.	1.4329139381376608
We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians.	1.100448801747614
We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.	0.9497790279146798
With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them.	1.0544082184474683
The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza.	0.9665453001257197
European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period.	0.6978714613953394
In this context, let me applaud the important steps that the Palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency.	1.013580597569504
President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week.	0.9602351736420608
This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law.	1.2164408849270498
The Commission is actively involved in those efforts.	1.2324731719122373
The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs.	1.1190825760948857
We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year.	0.8805447030137719
This package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels.	1.0983401920603064
Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East.	1.2248210169516525
A number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of Community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them, helping to consolidate a Golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the Golan Heights.	1.1195891305349661
Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy.	0.9183386098510902
Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon, the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict, will also demand considerable efforts. We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole.	1.3182589904289996
A solution is needed to the Palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world, numbering nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead.	1.270617215342903
We must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region's very scarce water resources.	1.122425892772855
Lastly, but maybe most importantly, we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas, bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems.	1.4460281056544761
It is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace.	1.4279709291300202
I want to underline that point.	1.057826495974596
I wish insistently to remind the Council and, should it be necessary, Parliament, that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing.	1.4314457075184102
I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide. I hope I can add that we will want to provide that.	1.3286653181100092
We have made progress in recent months and weeks, as Mr Gama mentioned earlier.	1.393780542911821
But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way.	1.1927638930691669
We will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome.	1.3195385051059452
Lastly, I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes, what I said at the outset of my remarks: that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate, largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening.	1.4878827305414177
I hope the House will understand that.	1.2172902016131601
Mr President, Commissioner Patten has our understanding.	1.1768079957796305
I would like to tell him that communications with Madrid are usually more fluid and, therefore, I hope to see him there soon.	1.4008791157505365
The statements we have heard today on the Middle East peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which Minister Gama - whose absence from this debate I also regret - has made of the region, accompanied by other Council representatives.	1.235069840274761
The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation.	1.3181240524092825
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation.	1.315061585230628
In this sense, I share Commissioner Patten' s positive attitude.	1.2232549801683514
Let me explain: it is true that the Israeli Government has delayed the third hand-over of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authorities.	1.1299476200867604
It is also true, however, that, since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements, 39% of the territory of the West Bank has been handed over to the Palestinian National Authority, together with two thirds of the Gaza Strip and, more importantly, this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with, since, under the terms laid down in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Israeli Government has the right to delay that handover.	1.3640953332590358
This is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks, as Prime Minister Barak has promised.	1.1303835919680285
On the other hand, the decision to delay the second round of talks, initiated in Shepherdstown by the Syrian Arab Republic, is undoubtedly significant, but I am convinced that the hopes which were raised on 3 January in that town will not be dashed.	1.2350766674999407
Mr President, the fact that the different groups in this Parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution, in this ever controversial debate, which is the result of a broad consensus, seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes.	1.435623899406606
I would therefore like, equally firmly, to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences, which are still no doubt profound, between the parties.	1.4396731543613512
In my judgement, this constitutes a guarantee to both sides, both from a political and a financial point of view, of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for.	1.5419944766081735
It is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to heal the serious social differences which exist.	1.4836728454219852
But this also serves to make a claim, on the part of the European Union, for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be bankers - and which will be suitably visible to the public.	1.499359316682386
There is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the President of the European Parliament to the region will contribute to this.	1.343430324756298
Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account.	1.1775798943629097
I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Galeote Quecedo' s speech set here.	1.080470125250208
We in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process.	0.8869635655871481
It is, of course, a peace process which is finally under way.	1.1087869990781787
If we think of how the process was looking a year ago, the difference between then and now is like that between night and day, despite difficulties and delays.	1.248789455721301
I want to emphasise four points.	1.0803707996653005
First of all, the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement contains, as everyone knows, a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel' s commitments. This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements.	1.2830773871607735
While the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun, I think it is important to keep the two processes apart.	1.2472446102992576
A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements.	1.261672982937919
What we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in Gaza, the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank, further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments.	1.3747469848911245
The second point relates to Syria.	0.6272255201698699
There, the border question is obviously central.	1.1341122777744599
How negotiations are proceeding there, we still do not know.	1.2368867301749016
What is important, however, is that they have begun.	1.3684236125690483
An important question in this context is the future distribution of water.	1.1046129283530346
As things are at present, the Golan Heights account for between a third and a sixth of Israel's water supply.	1.091674476458876
The third aspect is the peace negotiations in Syria which are closely linked to the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon.	1.0143684131280044
According to UNIFIL, there are now concrete signs that Israel is preparing to withdraw, which is something we welcome.	1.2959661845953798
There too, of course, outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the Lebanese Palestinian refugees.	1.0567237938529812
My last point concerns the future Palestinian State.	0.6731515644298294
This may be proclaimed in the course of this year, with or without Israel' s support.	1.1563247158362004
The Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party.	1.208114485595629
Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year, there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date.	1.155075622732016
In this context, it is important for those of us who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be as Commissioner Patten said, namely a state subject to public control, and that it should be a democratic state.	1.4571829071650333
This is something to which we all want to contribute.	1.500530085099522
Mr President, I would like to refer, firstly and above all, to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate. My Group has made a contribution to this resolution and, needless to say, approves of it.	1.4830691296837821
More specifically, however, I would like to express our delight at the fact that, after such a long time, Israel and Syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion.	1.194611059887777
The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East.	0.9216797027801619
It is, therefore, regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being.	0.9604940076427985
Indeed, both parties will need to make huge efforts.	1.5375887263753825
Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders, as well as Syria' s integrity.	1.255691996432913
It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue.	1.2166909267282904
In addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria, I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that, in the framework of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach will appear possible.	1.4271497861760662
Nevertheless, it is still regrettable that the European Union, one of the most important financial donors, is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process.	1.435504026887812
This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the European Union' s common foreign and security policy.	1.00537296036018
This is where Mr Solana, the High Representative to the Council, could come into his own.	1.473584689040722
The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region.	1.3196884486523335
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation.	1.1270502063692422
In this respect, we support Libya' s participation, provided that it recognises human rights, renounces support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process.	1.2259638629934095
There are still, needless to say, many unresolved problems and unanswered questions, also involving the Palestinians.	1.1130365565846467
Everyone knows that the peace process is a protracted and difficult affair but we are convinced that, with the necessary trust, perseverance and indispensable political will, our common goal, namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East, will be achieved.	1.4403649324746561
Mr President, it is pleasing that, despite certain delays and problems, the peace negotiations are going on both between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and Syria.	1.4195158747711192
The moment of truth is approaching.	0.6143209347589875
Is Israel prepared to comply with the UN' s resolutions and, in exchange for peace and security, hand back the Arab areas which were conquered in 1967?	1.1438749389996128
Will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation?	0.7453288687256001
Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan?	0.895369268101382
Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and, therefore, reliable as a partner in peace?	1.0675333334853254
Will Syria fully accept Israel' s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law?	0.8165304507908258
The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country, Israel, does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility.	1.212461720911917
Peace in the Middle East concerns us all, however.	1.1331403745193336
It is therefore good that the EU should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state.	1.4485449237131296
Against this background, I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler' s extermination of the Jews is being held, which is obviously a welcome initiative.	1.2180454703549912
Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world, not one of them, however, is an Arab state included in the EU' s Barcelona process.	1.3101381137005317
This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Nazis' anti-Semitism, which of course is completely incorrect.	1.0762470037365892
The Arab world' s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as, for example, Algeria' s fight for freedom against France.	1.0057281249889956
But today, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel.	0.8942419069166037
I therefore wonder whether Commissioner Patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one Arab state to the holocaust conference in Stockholm.	1.1665076231775222
Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion.	1.3033019935058325
It is high time there was peace in the Middle East.	0.8153637721277298
It is time to end the era which began with the Balfour declaration in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. It is time there were secure borders and political, social and economic rights in every country in this region, and that human rights were recognised and upheld in Syria, Palestine, Israel and everywhere else.	1.2655615564475493
This is an exercise in sovereignty, and in democracy for each population and every individual, but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights, and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given.	1.5082066931300477
I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question, but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982.	1.112157787753961
Israel has to accept its responsibilities, withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but, at the same time, it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area.	1.120676969855848
However, Israel is not the only country concerned with security.	1.7175781536933856
The same goes for the other countries, especially for the Palestinians, who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas B and C, despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements. Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999, 174 000 dunams of land were confiscated, 8 462 of which have been taken under Mr Barak' s Government.	1.1608774216452982
Trees have been uprooted, houses are still being demolished and, above all, water supplies have been reduced or refused, especially in East Jerusalem, while the settlements continue and are growing constantly.	1.2465254156022527
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that with the election of the new government, positive steps have been taken: negotiations, at least, have resumed. But in the Middle East, there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state, if they cannot move freely within their own territory.	1.5244601309803854
All the international community has to do is implement Resolutions 332, 248, 245 and 194.	1.126846204489712
We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria, as well as Mr Barak' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el­-Sheikh agreements.	1.0910941329131938
We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid.	1.2536459447162789
We cannot be content with a role backstage. We must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the United States, as Minister Gama said.	1.2748862070712343
Mr President, firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today, particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process, and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of "banker" for the entire operation.	1.5205387430048385
I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended.	1.0181345312386985
I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date.	1.3616178442917584
Nevertheless, we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late.	1.344628260368758
The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome.	1.1692134609154965
Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East.	0.993982838679266
I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum.	1.1939501613474302
The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security.	0.9934795944261927
If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel/Syria question might be promising.	0.939714605460512
On the issue of Palestine, I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement.	1.276078329970171
The key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment, as well as the transfer of territories.	1.21812726714618
The low level of releases of Palestinian prisoners and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted, as well as not approving new ones, pose further obstacles.	0.9606792356834651
These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations, although, I believe, these talks will not be held up indefinitely.	1.3558572561331679
At present, the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first, while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security.	1.2680073119203326
Currently, both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.	1.1266596174101153
In conclusion, while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process, now that the Syrian Government has been brought into the peace process, Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward.	1.1442943425404433
I sincerely hope that, in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East, all the key protagonists will move forward quickly, in the very near future, so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved.	1.3103060058122293
Mr President, the various motions for resolutions tabled in Parliament more or less represent the situation in the Middle East.	1.1727144443396518
There are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syria, but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue.	1.365508667466174
Indeed, the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability.	1.2664380614457622
The time has come for Israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories, at last recognising once and for all the authority of Palestine, whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of Yasser Arafat.	1.1635135418279885
It is equally important not to lose sight of the Iraq question, which no one discusses anymore, thereby relegating the problems of millions of women, elderly people and children, the victims of an embargo as arrogant as it is wicked, to oblivion.	1.285100620304702
I do not know what Syria and Israel will want or be able to do in reality, but I do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it attached the same importance to peoples' lives as it does to the ballasts of the cold, colourless, artificial neon bulbs in our lamps, which can illuminate houses but not the world in the third millennium.	1.3536375706206167
Mr President, the Israeli author, Amos Oz, managed to capture very aptly the icy atmosphere at the negotiating table between the Israelis and Syrians recently.	1.0050018050812388
He was under the impression that the Syrians thought that, in exchange for the Golan Heights, all they had to do was to fax the Israelis a receipt.	1.21387136767928
Oz' s impression is also echoed in the Israeli press.	0.8547614786101055
It contrasts Prime Minister Barak' s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude, even physical absence, of the strong man of Damascus, President Assad, at the negotiations in the United States.	1.3105578404450473
Surely Assad would be Barak' s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister.	0.9152316947008903
And the Israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of Minister Farouk al-Shara in Shepherdstown.	0.7526238602608315
His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting.	0.6157066828442147
But why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic niceties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory?	0.8889736248816316
Well, the Syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face.	1.0947382354211725
At the end of the day, Israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the Golan.	0.8004670195875939
All the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process.	0.8574307331876869
It is, however, very much in doubt whether Brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the Israeli and Syrian authorities require from their peace patron, the United States, not to mention the heavy, equally costly, security guarantees in case of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan.	1.3093780243420365
I would like to finish off by asking the European Council and Commission a question.	1.375664203608738
How accurate are the press reports which state that the Portuguese Presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the Golan?	1.0742835284440613
Mr President, the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between Syria and Israel is not good news, but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people.	1.1429008425486138
It is clear that, for once, the United States has not been able to secure progress on the restarting of these negotiations, and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome: the Syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and re-establish the borders which existed before 4 June 1967, while the Israelis wish, since they consider that it suits their situation better, to have the borders which were set in 1923.	1.358227231111491
The suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East.	0.8747901229642533
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment.	1.1699550602213602
After the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Leader of the Palestinian Authority, the Israeli Prime Minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 February, the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.	1.2258654266445292
What can the European Union do in these circumstances?	1.433696459460951
Unfortunately, very little.	1.5360023450734526
It naturally has to support these negotiations, sponsored by the United States; contacts have to be increased; the presence of the European Union envoy, Ambassador Moratinos, who has fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency, within the powers of the European Union, is positive.	1.3607316182777196
But none of this hides the fact that there is a certain sense of impotence, because when the negotiators from each side fly back to the United States this weekend, we will have to remember that, for every 100 dollars spent on the peace process in the region, 60 are contributed by the European Union.	1.323226797255418
When we consider that a conference will soon be held in Moscow, it becomes clear that the European Union' s presence in this peace process is somewhat pitiful.	1.4299878020265433
I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role, that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process.	1.5252196017758888
I hope that the forthcoming visit by the President of the European Parliament to the region, as well as the presidents of the relevant interparliamentary delegations, will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the European Union in this complicated and difficult peace process.	1.420414651727112
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I should like to thank you for your statements, especially Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share and I shall not, therefore, repeat any of his ideas.	1.2613634237135831
I should just like to make three comments which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see as similar but which, for various reasons, a Member can formulate more openly.	1.294904654108408
First, I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authorities.	1.3696544608127486
But we have enough agreements now: Oslo, Wye Plantation, Sharm el-Sheikh.	0.9506201407292203
We have enough agreements; they just need to be implemented.	1.0425892358923332
However, in this regard I share Mr Salafranca' s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week, namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe.	1.2578379319112645
My second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel.	0.7689546881732736
I consider this to be very encouraging news.	0.9227078265297579
But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued.	1.2157528954718837
I should like to make it quite clear: if the Golan Heights are returned to Syria, the problem in this region will be solved.	1.4773979974138487
On the question of the referendum which various Members have referred to: we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations.	1.1926515054821958
In Germany, there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay.	1.4972961770852673
That would be a similar situation.	0.9106592337481952
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union.	0.8406584520967962
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there, Commissioner Patten.	1.278493962230439
You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament, and that includes your proposal, and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it.	1.5559358615394967
But we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own; the Presidency of the Council must take action, the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves.	1.4143981522698859
Then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution.	1.1118625111784888
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, the recent peace talks begun in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East. It has taken fifty years to reach this point, which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations.	1.3954262732817928
There will be no meeting today in Shepherdstown but we must hope, as Mr Patten said just now, that this postponement of the negotiations due to Syrian requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the Middle East.	1.3867175768830753
This hope is contained in our motion for a resolution. We hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereignties and the right to live securely within safe and recognised borders.	1.184457640757337
All the foreign troops, including therefore the Syrian forces, must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 520 of the United Nations Security Council.	1.17716285892909
Dare we hope for an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July 2000, the date promised by Ehud Barak?	1.0734534135005949
Dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and its neighbours to the north?	0.9751245651290127
We really hope and believe so.	0.6917540850429188
Never have the parties been so determined.	0.7594470489368583
One fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people. There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations.	1.281465832747892
Following the attack in Hadera on Monday, we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism.	1.1198202090225522
In terms of balance, or should I say imbalance, I must add that it is to be regretted that Europe is still playing a minor political role in resolving this conflict.	1.3575351723118632
At midday, Mr Gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region.	1.3132433319010617
Despite everything, we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of Washington.	1.3789000669200315
Like other Arab countries before them, the Syrians chose the Americans to sponsor the negotiations.	1.0483274674496945
This was the choice also made by Israel where Europe suffers from a partisan public image, and this is a fact, not a judgement.	1.5161109238737664
This is now the opportunity to reiterate to Mr Patten, Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos how much we are relying on their efforts to include Europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict.	1.1963357307109999
Although it is difficult for Europe to speak with one voice about the peace process, it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity.	1.4433541377870098
The next item is questions to the Council (B5-0040/99) and the Commission (B5-0041/99), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice (Article 39 of the TEU).	1.2698129307140855
Mr President, 1999 was the year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, of the communitisation of the Schengen Agreement and of the Extraordinary Tampere Council.	1.3061227217077205
These have been the most important moments in the Council' s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.	1.0603788330800163
The Council has decided to draw up a charter of citizens' rights - and we rejoice in this; it has decided to implement Article 13 of the Treaty, combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia, and it has decided to approximate the laws on conditions for admission and residence, as well as guaranteeing residents treatment which is fair and on an equal footing with the citizens of the Union.	1.2973801430424354
It has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposals for civil cooperation.	1.3267696292317008
This has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a Community framework.	1.3663868296719681
They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner, Mr Antonio Vitorino, and we congratulate them on this as well.	1.4770198006111503
Furthermore, they have taken on the task of creating a "scoreboard" to verify the progress made in this area at Community level, but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States.	1.3859490745139713
We are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decisions, despite the fact that, for this House, the Treaty of Amsterdam included one disappointment: that of delaying, for five years, our role, our ability to participate actively, to democratically control this area of freedom, security and justice, as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice.	1.4538268620979884
However, if, on verifying the progress made during 1999, which is within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty, we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out, the scene looks considerably darker, Mr President.	1.5351110782390924
It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to, the other begrudges.	1.3152279080563505
Despite all the commitments made at the highest level, the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged.	1.3988754958161809
Programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or, at least, this Parliament is unable to do so.	1.2260183002338076
We have presented the Council with a series of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them.	1.423488255537795
We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament.	1.3057276377310987
I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out.	1.3638312036075224
There are doubts in my Group and doubts also persist in this House, for example, about something which should be good news: the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework.	1.193453461753219
Schengen has been incorporated, as we said earlier, into the acquis, but it has been done with very little transparency.	1.4847587263492092
Not a single piece of information, nor a single consultation, has been addressed to Parliament during this process; neither on the association of the United Kingdom, nor on the incorporation of Greece, nor on the negotiations with Norway and Iceland.	1.2630324499369963
The same is true with regard to immigration policy.	1.0006876898627035
We have amused ourselves with a pile of reports, but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives; they have disappeared.	1.4233940650865577
We hope that 2000 will be the year for action, in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations.	1.4061735651683576
We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament.	1.2465788138777742
The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union.	1.2723727736796016
The Council can act in accordance with Parliament' s decisions, or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project.	1.187723990501389
If it chooses the second approach, it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom, security and justice is built.	1.1512236175027124
Alternatively, it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions, in order to move forward in another way.	1.3572576141975679
Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit, thus preparing for the future.	1.1381100535965418
Provide the Commission with the necessary resources and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress made at Community level and at the level of the Member States, and we will be - and the Council will be - able to deal with the decisions made at Tampere and move towards a Union which is freer, more just and more secure.	1.406800949392057
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I do not have a background as a Member of the European Parliament, you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague Fernando Gomes.	1.3819227014333608
As Mrs Terrón i Cusí said in her speech, 1999 was a year of great expectations in the field of justice and home affairs - an expectation realised with the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, an expectation realised with the conclusions of the Tampere Council, and a fundamental expectation, as from this year, that will be realised in the form of specific actions.	1.3385446026332304
We are all aware that, to this end, it is essential for the Council to approve, as quickly as possible, the scoreboard which Commissioner Vitorino has the remit of establishing.	1.409519612826592
I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency' s earnest desire for political agreement to be reached on the scoreboard at the informal Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 March.	1.1790982532033343
Turning to the specific questions that Mrs Terrón i Cusí has put to us, I shall group them into three basic areas: the fight against organised crime, the operation of the Judicial Network, particularly as regards criminal matters, and questions on Europol.	1.2534263965946504
Regarding the fight against organised crime, 1999 marked the implementation of several important actions stemming from the Vienna action plan, which resulted in the signing of the Charter of European Professional Associations, in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the Member States for receiving information relevant to the fight against money laundering. And I must not forget the Finnish Presidency' s proposal for a Council decision which is being considered in the Multi-disciplinary Group.	1.332556394211266
This is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work, not just by securing approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium, but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the divergence of views that exists, particularly at Council level, on issues concerning the fight against organised crime.	1.3937077034315581
With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency, with the aim of organising a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council.	1.142675366898366
If this is not to be a mere media event, it will need to be carefully prepared by a joint committee, the composition of which the Portuguese Presidency has already proposed.	1.5355627701687848
Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime.	0.7759249344156731
Here, in addition to the work being done in the group of experts on the Pre-Accession Pact, it is important that it has proved possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organised crime between the European Union and the Russian Federation, a plan which is now being finalised, and to organise meetings of liaison officials from the Member States, in Moscow, and to develop a set of further initiatives.	1.551327430726702
Another area is EU involvement in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its various protocols, and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the Council of Europe, in particular on cyber crime.	1.437484465827559
As this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme, the presidency believes that it is worthwhile, bearing in mind the principles of Chapter VI of the Treaty, to explore suitable means of providing the European Parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the United Nations Convention.	1.4473765291285896
With regard to the Judicial Network, significant progress has been made, in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the European Judicial Network, whilst the Multi-disciplinary Group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan.	1.282831112623389
However, we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium, so as to give a fresh impetus, while preserving continuity, to the work done under the previous action plan.	1.6478268127068176
Still on judicial cooperation, considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro, and the European Parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance.	1.3155202118415814
We believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible, we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments, and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects, including those featuring in initiatives already presented by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself has called for.	1.3762985187447125
It is important in this field to implement measures relating to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions, and we believe that on the basis of work already done, it will be possible, at least in the field of seizure of assets, for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decisions.	1.5471032805685334
Lastly then, Europol, which started its work in 1999. The Council approved a set of instruments, with which Parliament is familiar, to make Europol' s operations viable but, of course, the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol still remain, and these are issues which have naturally taken on a new dimension in view of the political decision taken in Tampere to reinforce Europol' s powers and, above all, to give it an operational dimension.	1.4551979149784595
The French Presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol.	0.9625815004973575
The Portuguese Presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the Eurojust network, since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust, this option cannot be ruled out at present.	1.3891045051241357
For this reason, it is essential that the Council' s debates on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conducted in parallel, so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also.	1.2842829906750755
I believe that in this context, and in the context of the dialogue that the Council and Parliament will have to establish on the future of Europol and Eurojust, it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the Council and Parliament with regard to Europol.	1.4108241483370905
We are familiar with Parliament' s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council' s legal advisers.	1.3838870005771229
I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of Europol, and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved.	1.4021881694636595
Mr President, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, without wishing to compete with the Ministers as regards emotions, I have to say that I am not moved, rather I am disturbed to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time, and I just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the Union!	1.3926878268455012
I would also like to thank Mrs Terrón i Cusí for having asked the question which has given rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, and to thank all the Members who, in their various committees, have actively participated in preparing this annual debate. I would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society.	1.310495514478584
In this first speech, I would like to share with Parliament the Commission' s view of the most important events in 1999.	1.2887369778926159
I believe that I can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the Union on issues of freedom, security and justice.	1.16123999700479
It has already been mentioned that the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force in May and this Parliament stated that the most far-reaching innovation in this Treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom, security and justice.	1.1162598126027814
At the same time, it also represents a quantum leap in qualitative terms, and a logical and vital step in the development of the Union, in the wake of the establishment of the internal market, the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy.	1.3159408722775998
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union.	1.28624350811669
And it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizens residing in the territory of the European Union, recognising that this is only meaningful if it is rooted in a secure base, with solid foundations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access, on equal terms, and in which our citizens can have real confidence.	1.3891009209027154
The Union' s commitment to establishing an area of freedom, security and justice was confirmed at Tampere.	0.9245085077680818
I would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the European Council, reaffirming the importance that the Heads of State and Government of the Union attached to a fundamental project, together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality, following a progressive strategy, within a time-frame of five years, and that, above all, the three components of this area should be in balance: freedom, security and justice.	1.3068016722856082
1999 was also marked by the German Presidency' s initiative to draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.977297509047561
I believe that at the present stage in the European Union' s development, it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental rights in force at European Union level in a charter, so as to make them as visible and accessible as possible to our citizens.	1.4478464779966354
As I have already said on a number of occasions, I am in favour - the Commission is in favour - of drawing up a charter which would reflect, on the broadest basis possible and as part of a dynamic process, the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and the general principles of Community law, rather than being a mere statement of the lowest common denominator.	1.4350103767832239
In my capacity as a representative of the Commission, I will ensure that the charter and the actions stemming from it represent an affirmation of a Union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integral part of Europe' s common heritage.	1.3384284129217574
That is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged European Union in the eyes of every European citizen, an enlarged Europe based on respect for rights and freedoms, with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection, in other words, a Union rooted in the political values which underpin contemporary democracies.	1.390330776924714
I must not overlook the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 1999-2004 parliamentary term of the European Parliament, that it was the year in which the new Commission took up its duties and, as a consequence, the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities.	1.5431617752977864
In addition to these events, I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999.	1.2715056311059705
In the field of immigration, borders and asylum, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the Eurodac database, and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into Member States of the European Union with a view to reuniting families, as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the European Union.	1.2919464134946919
We also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Iceland and Norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention to those two countries.	1.1148206747463978
The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and ultimately, in December, it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund.	1.30501017645178
In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the "communitisation" of certain conventions. These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I), the convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (Brussels II), and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters.	1.2548542354754617
In 1999, we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the European Union, which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at Tampere. This communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime, in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation, including the cost of justice.	1.3627291098161831
We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment.	1.0628130845686223
In the field of European Union legislation on combating financial crime, the Commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering.	1.2433340805653792
In 1999, Europol took up its duties and we in the Commission, echoing the Portuguese Presidency' s statement today, sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam, there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between Europol and the relevant judicial institutions, and in particular Eurojust.	1.2970492743441548
In 1999, the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs, which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council.	1.3449060682457192
This list of actions, which is not exhaustive, should, here today, in the presence of the Council Presidency and of the Members of this House, help to make it clear that, while 1999 was a year of consolidation for EU action in this key area, it also - I very much hope - represented the start of a new phase, marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.	1.3826067090929832
For this reason, 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the EU' s institutions respond to our citizens' demands for guaranteed freedom of movement, with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection.	1.234171610972709
In other words, 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council, for Parliament and for the Commission.	1.4958906561008762
As I have already said, the Commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council.	1.3270344278272284
This scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning. It will also, and above all, be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the European Union' s institutions towards the public.	1.4121378722413565
It is for the public, therefore, that we are developing the area of freedom, security and justice.	1.1002328747919587
The progress made will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council, nor even to the European Parliament, but to a combination of European institutions and to the Member States themselves, in as much as - as has already been pointed out here - specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity.	1.4631809073246804
In the coming weeks, I shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs.	1.1661368501615348
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project.	1.4754557531175074
And we hope, during the Portuguese Presidency, to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council, taking account of the soundings that I have just mentioned.	1.3699830460766662
It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions, and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny.	1.362331389855949
For this reason, and I believe that this is a challenge we are all facing, I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship, for legality and, ultimately, for democracy itself.	1.562125090364638
In addition to the scoreboard, I would like to anticipate the following initiatives that the Commission intends to present during 2000 - and I would like to emphasise that I am delighted the Portuguese Presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom, security and justice as a priority in its work programme.	1.2914943894256832
I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, which is also the political message of Tampere, and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies.	1.4431529262020952
Regarding immigration and asylum, the Commission intends to present proposals for creating a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees; to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the Dublin Convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the Union; and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers.	1.2823956307307094
I also intend to contribute to the process of clarifying the role of action plans as part of the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and to make progress in adapting Community agreements in the field of readmission by including standard clauses.	1.1387291911175532
Furthermore, on the subject of crossing the external borders of Member States, which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons, I shall, in the next few days, be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders.	1.4105043254062086
Turning to judicial cooperation, in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, I sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the Council a proposal for minimum standards ensuring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceedings.	1.2903203844066446
I also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and speeding up cross-border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims, alimony claims and non-contested claims.	0.8714621010186857
As a follow-up to the Tampere and Helsinki conclusions, the Commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a European Union strategy to combat organised crime.	1.1493751333488709
We will be organising and supporting actions including, in particular, the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters.	1.2787070174812623
The Commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention, so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area, and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the Community for this purpose.	1.2615600257683712
The Commission will also support the presidency' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering, an eminently cross-pillar issue.	1.2425206909337665
The Commission will fulfil the remit given to it at Tampere to present proposals for approving definitions, criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings, economic exploitation of immigrants, and sexual exploitation of woman and children, with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication, notably the Internet, for distributing child pornography.	1.2668699646977792
We are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime.	1.1774540046040578
The year 2000 also marks the start of the implementation of the European Union Drugs Strategy 2000-2004.	1.227756595182853
In this field the Commission, in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament, will give its full support to the Interinstitutional Conference to be held on drugs in February.	1.3662684341567426
With regard to Schengen, without wishing to trespass on the territory of the Council, or more precisely the incorporation of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework, I would like to stress, on the topical subject of restoring border controls, that the Commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority.	1.3336822513167075
The recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on Article 62 of the Treaty.	1.1704413804870801
As was emphasised at Tampere, and as part of our preparations for the Feira European Council in June 2000, we will have to prepare a summary of the implications of the new external dimension of justice and home affairs with a view to adopting cross-pillar policy strategies, which strengthen the links between the Union' s internal and external policies in this field and help to uphold the Union' s position on the world stage.	1.4781582564364821
Nevertheless, I must make it clear that all these actions will, of course, have to take into account the principles agreed at the Helsinki European Council concerning applicant countries, so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	1.2557267433197172
Furthermore, it is important to remember that 2000 will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of applicant countries and I anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in preparing the negotiating dossiers on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at Helsinki.	1.3147887183392029
Lastly, I would like to state once again that the Commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1.176585519027765
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself. As I have told Parliament, the task before us is immense and ambitious, and the Commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge.	1.5048908973294726
We hope that we can count on the support of Parliament, and - why not say it - of the Council to secure these resources and to achieve these objectives, so that the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice becomes a reality as soon as possible, thus allowing us all to contribute, in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, to the realisation of this project, which is, without a doubt, the "jewel in the crown" of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1.393336495932772
Mr President, having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market, the House now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other' s competence.	1.2260643457380054
Commissioner Vitorino, although I would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable, words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the Council has demonstrated towards us.	1.2191482837869938
It looked, as Mr Schulz once aptly said in committee, as if the Council understood the area of freedom, security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free rein, security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will.	1.4430643143533775
Minister Gomes, I have, of course, heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency.	1.4781367823597333
I should like to raise three points which for us, as Members of the PPE Group, must be focal points when such an area is created.	1.304975220675146
First: a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed.	1.2017541869365462
The Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers.	1.1313048023448824
As far as a European asylum law is concerned, a start was in fact made at Vienna and Tampere.	1.3342319498214203
Unfortunately, however, it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions.	1.3116096556685888
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union.	1.2850575860996096
Similarly, it cannot be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent.	1.1858729363884088
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda.	0.7422510279106385
Secondly: the introduction of a Europe-wide fight against organised crime, including by Europol and Eurojust.	1.1352917887102432
The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith.	1.0853092580746613
We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work.	0.9994663655256766
However, the Council should also bear in mind that, if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime, we do not only need to widen Europol' s remit, as decided at Tampere; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities.	1.3776876301224834
We are not just calling for more control, and more control over Europol; our motto here is "Less is sometimes more!"	1.2960391721745297
With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments, we may have a great deal of control, but it is inefficient control.	1.202596437843932
We want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament, without hampering the work of Europol.	1.161172688288651
At the same time, we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction.	0.9977403627226766
Thirdly: the extension to Parliament' s rights in this context.	1.2526889754382815
If the establishment of such an area, in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens, is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats, while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake, then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens.	1.4035805134469492
There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and, as we have already said, to strengthen the principle of democratic control.	1.6407525229674158
We want an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe, not against them.	1.1218028055493663
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown.	1.2613806692758256
I was also encouraged by Commissioner Patten' s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises.	1.0939703435848125
Perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in Kosovo the police they promised.	0.9965866034649586
I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress.	1.11724756960459
The first is asylum.	1.166616278098854
It is essential to establish a single European system, but one based on fairness, full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions, including an end to routine detention.	1.4240394739001183
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years.	1.068972997623009
The second area is that of freedom: freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union; freedom of information; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals.	1.3671470003107529
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom, not just about repression.	1.4935181840321041
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems.	1.124797014398158
Eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty, the end of the nation-state, and so on. But the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in France, including British student, Isabel Peake, who was thrown off a train, shows why we need mutual recognition.	1.4719176478147693
Arrested and released in Madrid, he is now being extradited after arrest in Lisbon.	1.0707154978772029
Whatever the Eurosceptics say, it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters.	1.2839923367461492
Finally, as has already been said, it is essential, and I hope that the IGC will cover this, to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas, with democratic and judicial scrutiny.	1.6481232684811897
Mr President, all I can say about 1999 is this: how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter.	1.351169850824085
I hope that it works out.	1.2427014064125632
The Tampere Summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for Europe, and for the area of freedom, security and justice in particular.	1.1133574901287306
Numerous questions are still outstanding.	0.49687800512534447
Answers are still awaited.	0.5496096758351794
Since Tampere, there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent.	1.1037458269896483
Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding.	0.907991209423837
On the other hand, quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life.	1.2022482043837315
The creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future.	1.0994644992962772
However, it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the Union.	1.531891077459969
The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force.	0.7825244391738903
In Tampere, the question of granting operational powers was discussed.	0.9658612631188652
We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control.	1.2110116101694854
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC.	0.9015378896767666
Parliament has amended the contractual text.	0.5813402504028229
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament' s modus operandi.	1.1578867772297696
Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them.	1.361033733427106
Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors.	0.9508364334931803
And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe.	1.0611525887489646
Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers, I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months.	1.4253188323782446
Mr President, Commissioner, the oral question tabled by Mrs Terrón i Cusí shows that this House is taking a firm stance. Indeed, six months after the election of this new Parliament, we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe.	1.438602803592067
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this.	1.1391587348745984
We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice.	1.0813025037555635
Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems.	1.053062756899796
This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres.	0.9428241395739154
For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged.	1.364066932400168
A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism, xenophobia, nationalism and extreme-right racist movements.	1.096137223599113
We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees.	1.0645863626945526
The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable.	0.8661099631387458
All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect.	0.8644684569552558
Last week, and somewhat by chance, I witnessed, at Roissy airport, a scene of rare violence in which two young women, admittedly illegal immigrants, were being returned to Conakry.	1.3543491251307287
They were treated like the worst criminals.	0.7658432295538722
They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair, surrounded by a horde of state security police.	0.8206472491728362
The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour.	0.8445987708460198
Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships.	0.9674025119705841
The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed.	1.215994752259911
Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund, we could take the decision to set this up.	1.4529297759643836
The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though this summit provided an important basis.	1.1605110855446787
Likewise, we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action.	1.2849322966401315
The laws against racism must be harmonised.	0.7410508045146371
What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty?	0.9374838089324169
What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women?	1.110462497634548
How do you aim to eradicate homophobia, racism and sexism?	1.0083573022981978
We must take the best from each of our countries.	1.2083706722239076
When six European countries have granted the right to vote, the President of this House can venture to extend this right to vote, and eligibility to participate in the municipal and European elections, to all people from outside the Community who have lived in Europe for more than five years.	1.330709583915431
The regularisation of illegal immigrants in certain countries, including your own, must act as an example to others. These illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlords, an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation, rendering them modern-day slaves.	1.2118031501182451
In more general terms, this Presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants.	1.1560285478201076
Immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses.	0.7842156289733005
How do you intend to make our people understand that, today like always, immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is, and will remain, essential in the context of population?	1.3739201596438106
What action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers?	1.0856156999365878
Mr President, there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security, freedom and justice.	1.154742079486965
The European Union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees.	1.4827056160267478
The level of racism in our society is terrifying.	1.0462417801929542
Ireland, for generations, sent her sons and daughters to places of safety throughout the world, but now when the Celtic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations, we are showing a very ugly side to our character. Racism in Ireland is endemic.	1.205958110630175
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time.	1.3192431270045366
We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up.	1.2514956453291386
There is a willingness but fear pervades, and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union.	1.261970816265793
Mr President, we take note that the excuse-making, reticent Presidency, which, in recent months, has prevented us from holding a debate such as the one we have been able to hold today, has come to an end.	1.5419489556790777
I totally agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Schulz' s remarks, and truly believe that the European Parliament and the Court of Justice need to be more involved in the area of freedom, security and justice, without having to derogate from their own powers.	1.2926229125325932
Nevertheless, to avoid the customary circus, which every six months has us indiscriminately attacking the Presidency of the Council, maybe Parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five years.	1.24541870562152
The two identical-sounding questions which are under discussion are, of course, underpinned by a mantra of the kind which, in recent years, has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fine-sounding, but pernicious.	1.2913325904876953
And our current EU mantra is AFSJ: Area for Freedom, Security and Justice.	0.7282086501043634
Behind this lies another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House, namely to introduce such an area.	1.4655920049332258
And who is not in favour of security, freedom and justice?	1.1864490519026085
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions.	1.2554428450602102
Freedom, security and justice are the root system of any society, reflecting its history, corporate experience and political development.	0.9873867022580881
A system of this kind is not something the EU can introduce without society' s sustaining damage as a result.	1.0788958382416014
But it is precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security, freedom and justice.	1.0161298459744244
The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen.	1.0270193253741
That is already secured by means of the various national legal systems.	1.2377330693813835
The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society' s criminal law, policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU' s control.	1.0403646584965
It is concerned with increased integration which, as part of a duplicitous package, involves increased repression and control.	1.1258825365686966
You just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa, Schengen, Eurodac etc. Any democrat can spot two key problems.	1.0425563555146942
First of all, the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic.	1.146998563473335
How is it envisaged that the EU' s institutions, which are already stretched well beyond their capacity, can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition?	1.405434715351937
Think of last year' s deadly criticism of the Commission' s lack of propriety, ethics and accountability.	0.9696970236035048
It also, of course, finds indirect expression in the question.	0.8679716051257891
But, secondly, the projects will put a strain on, indeed will be injurious to, the national democracies.	1.3518917330617706
As long as the EU revolved around the internal market, only the body was being attacked. Now, it is the soul.	1.2600777016784026
Mr President, today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony.	1.3298497764176664
We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom, security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon, which has been accepted, will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists.	1.1784442855067443
The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons, nor have the loyalist terrorists, yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community.	1.2652396595259474
Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed.	1.1846891360079506
In 1998, we had 55 murders.	1.2975431470664978
In 1999, we had 7 murders and that does not include the Omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured.	1.108918195503121
Between 1998 and 1999, loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people, while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people.	1.044470916991752
Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193, while those against republicans totalled 97.	0.9810215892136419
Since January 2000, there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans, loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults, one leading to another murder, while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults.	1.1243030319628036
Mr President, that situation cannot continue and needs remedying.	1.4650869893169645
Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union.	1.3551281167889249
This is a task which all MEPs, the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature: the creation, as has been said already, of an area of freedom, security and justice.	1.3652363155250016
The Tampere Council, the motor and architect of this objective, has proposed certain goals, but five years, the time scale laid down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty, is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require.	1.3992877723165391
My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed, especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens, as the Commissioner has explained very well.	1.395246629589907
My second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system, adopting common procedural rules and, above all, putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons.	1.2625983907616731
The recent laws on aliens adopted in my country, Spain, and in Belgium, are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy.	1.3825855495094528
My third and final point relates to the external activities of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum.	1.2547382035416934
We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants.	1.263451299008647
We must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the East and the Mediterranean area, but we must do so with rigour, with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions, which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential needs.	1.397498208036203
Finally, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship.	1.3674206176299188
The Euro, employment, even security, are not enough.	1.4447323844090347
They need a 'European soul' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said.	1.2967816475384746
Mr President, unlike some of the previous speakers, I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino.	1.4414797670844173
This trio's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said.	0.7566674210703687
As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated.	1.028976645492649
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months.	0.9668687902244832
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune.	1.2230823819053998
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months.	1.0434844702273873
The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.	1.0000987136376207
One area though is extremely important, and this House must be involved in it: namely scrutiny.	1.4859890323606901
There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised, that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it.	1.5998944026257385
And we must make certain that the details are applicable, appropriate and relevant to the different countries.	1.2791106944970418
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon, one or two of which were referred to earlier on.	1.1907171039840256
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime.	1.323125075063822
That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about.	1.491916149157759
But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system, for example.	1.5271320451492973
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this, but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail.	1.4265181358535959
Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of 'scoreboard' .	0.8843910782238488
Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is.	0.7794881020040936
A scoreboard tells people the score; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible.	1.1858344357323878
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so.	1.223659998162629
At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening.	1.5609062974531691
Mr President, I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry, Mr Costa, and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed.	1.2888140485116144
Amsterdam and Tampere have given us much work to do together, as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terrón today shows.	1.3167412626833468
I would like to make three brief points.	1.1478362584003217
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament.	1.4641971023036366
It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together; we have been sizing each other up, we have had a few minor spats, but we need to work effectively together.	1.439308792663885
Let us stop the shadow-boxing. Let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duties that the Treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate.	1.0708791618056643
Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process.	0.8177177053596622
Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area.	1.0833170193809838
My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission.	1.1741577863368602
We have established a new Directorate-General, yet it has only 70 people all told.	1.178744541931507
There is an agreement to double this number, but I understand that, so far, not a single new person has arrived.	1.5878247842445652
We are setting the Commission a massive task, not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard.	1.3752525301899663
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs.	1.454676335992755
Finally, on the content of the debate, I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of its agenda.	1.4202573234993996
All good things come in threes, especially in our policy area.	1.1425768297522736
Two hundred years ago it was liberty, equality and fraternity, and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others.	1.1155645753298982
Now it is freedom, security and justice, and I hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security, important as it is, above the equally important needs of freedom and justice.	1.2412133525012337
Although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice should be mentioned, we must remember that there is still room for progress.	1.1561637244604448
The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete.	1.0764227766045429
The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this.	0.9457909746975831
The decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic, including all people, whatever their nationality, or excluding some.	1.32369451935576
The total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political rights of all European residents is to be regretted.	1.2683247114836966
Although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future, these plans do nothing to improve human rights, civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned.	1.2899832614569542
We know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements.	1.0433174478125573
Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of 'non-refoulement' [no turning back].	0.9101744822792162
Furthermore, it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament.	1.213179816949989
However, the main concern remains ...	1.5430194264059536
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner.	1.5418349938318547
I thank them for their statements to the House.	0.8536345662990685
Rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered I would like to deal with one specific topic: the question of drugs and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our societies.	1.1228426421060729
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States.	1.1294821023253137
We already have, on the international side, plans in place to combat drug trafficking, money laundering and so on.	1.2895611351274117
But to bring it down to a more human level: to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs, and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation; secondly, to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws; thirdly, to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of "normalisation" and "harm reduction" and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people.	1.2504196097934122
Mr President, I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out, or remind, the representative of the Commission that, in Belgium, the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence, right to be reunited with their families, etc.	1.3550947011712804
This is a Belgian government measure which flies in the face of the Schengen Treaty.	1.0919208102733857
I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December.	0.9867960458749878
I would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me, within the foreseeable future, of the steps the Commission will take to penalise this violation of the Schengen Treaty by the Belgian State, in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty.	1.4992709534019997
Mr President, esteemed gentlemen from Portugal, especially the Council representatives, you face great expectations on our part.	1.5116804583408268
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment.	1.3877230975174186
I refer to Eurodac.	0.7454282834003327
You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system, as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications, in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and, above all, in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure.	1.3711742760442687
We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument, together with an implementation committee, which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be.	1.4183524751994958
We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality.	0.503862679105188
Even in Tampere, we were of the opinion that Eurodac was becoming a reality.	1.0021081680279624
However, the Council then took another direction at the very next summit in December and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected, i.e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation, that the regulatory committee would be attached to the Council and that, where possible, Gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure.	1.3977139788645512
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see.	1.2851668420034765
My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures.	1.2600783016727506
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed, you will be doing us a great service.	1.2424160989354378
Mr President, Ministers, Commissioner, the 1999 harvest of decisions was indeed rich, so much so that it became difficult to gather, i.e. to put those decisions into practice.	1.311928779046081
I refer in particular to the Council and to the inertia of the Member States in implementing the decisions they had jointly made.	1.3043925950004536
However, the past year was positively marked by some momentous decisions, such as the decision to begin implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam, the decision to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the Community pillar, and the decision of the Cologne Council to create a Charter of Fundamental Rights and the decision of the Extraordinary European Council in Tampere to bind the Member States to common directions, priorities and goals with a view to creating a common area of freedom, security and justice.	1.2408741287086613
Without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made, we, the European Parliament, would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the Council to implement these decisions in many areas, as well as its lack of common vision and, in particular, the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament.	1.358030510894711
From what I have said, it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer.	1.2380239844989673
Neither will it stop raising vital issues. For example, how much progress are you willing to make and what measures, legislative or otherwise, will you be taking to combat the scourge of trafficking in human beings, child pornography on the Internet, drugs, and organised crime?	1.200601867582172
Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration?	1.011746412424902
How do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the Community, reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of Europe?	1.064417222359383
In light of this new international demographic class portrayed by experts at the UN, is it not about time you abandoned your traditional, conservative views on refugees and immigrants?	1.2062967152049981
I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency.	0.979699174460485
Mr President, I welcome much, indeed most, of what has been said in this debate.	1.6202459248487726
But I want to add a word of caution.	1.2006129044075275
We risk having not too few charters of rights in this Community, but too many: national, European Union and European Convention; not too few tribunals having the final say about our rights but possibly too many - there is the Court across the river there, there is the Court in Luxembourg.	1.3475314749384724
There are also courts in Karlsruhe, London, Lisbon, Dublin and Edinburgh.	1.0293878955586817
We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense.	1.0294478167039955
We must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights, for that would be the enemy of freedom, justice and security.	1.3475372396942464
We need, in short, to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these.	1.2795318503156443
But we must look always to subsidiarity.	1.167485807588204
Like everybody in this House, I want freedom, justice and security. I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation, chaos and confusion.	1.3693506566843892
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very quickly like to make one point. Various Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency.	1.2776235311534845
The President of Parliament has made us aware of the very limited time at our disposal, and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, and I therefore propose to reply objectively to all the questions put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attending next week.	1.5713742873955325
(Sustained applause)	0.3465662375340225
Thank you, Minister.	0.9480492404238173
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
Mr President, I am grateful for the Council' s oral, and also written, reply.	1.5042127268038754
Their efficiency has been truly remarkable.	0.5741945635719325
I will save a few seconds because I wanted to propose to the Council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs.	1.1184242131680888
Then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the Commission as well.	1.3600740827338962
Personally, I am pleased with some of the replies, for example, in relation to issues as sensitive as Schengen and the Europol Convention, which we hope will be reviewed, and I am pleased with the words of the Minister for Justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities.	1.3045349906857073
I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control.	1.1381133789363587
Representatives of the Council, within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this Parliament.	1.2327458121612718
I am sure that, with the willingness that you have shown today, the first thing you will do, in this new climate of understanding between us, will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you.	1.61944661357402
Question Time (Council)	0.3763026442786636
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Council.	1.0167653566290158
Question No 1 by (H-0780/99):	0.6290925209991528
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	0.5410005525470423
Turkey's nuclear plans B which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region B prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	0.5972170356121934
What steps will the Council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	0.6207636800940362
Mr President, the Council wishes to point out that Turkey is a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the objectives of which should allay the fears expressed by Mr Souladakis.	1.3422480473935245
The aim of this convention, which came into force on 24 October 1996, is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooperation.	1.3323246519016596
It further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks, so as to protect individuals, society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the ionising radiation that can be emitted by such installations.	1.0105918861597274
The convention, as you will be aware, also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur.	1.2442068728937041
I would also like to remind Members that, as a candidate for membership of the European Union, Turkey will - and this is a pre-accession condition, which is an important point - sooner or later, as part of its own pre-accession strategy, have to adopt a set of policies geared towards adopting the entire acquis communautaire in good time, and including therefore all provisions already in force on nuclear safety.	1.4059793456837366
Thank you for your answer.	0.48087277576425186
However, I would just like to add the following.	1.3356489988809352
Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2% with this unit.	0.8955087859166275
Nevertheless, rumour has it that it plans to buy Candu reactors of the type acquired by Pakistan and India which were used for nuclear weapons.	1.0116583865725017
In this respect, the issue requires closer examination, because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could heighten people' s suspicions.	1.322361186224814
My second point concerns the safety of these plants.	0.8038248103444543
In areas of high seismic risk, it is not enough just to have secure, earthquake-proof buildings. Speaking as an engineer, I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances.	1.1367833919178263
However, we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation; it is just not possible.	1.5793237688152761
With this in mind, it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes.	1.05019658097359
In this respect, and because Turkey is situated on the periphery of the European Union, we should be helping it to become a more secure, peaceful and cooperative country.	1.3502891416514042
That is our role and this is the point of my question.	1.5604057353369274
I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Souladakis has put forward.	0.9487927714227862
This is, of course, a highly sensitive issue.	1.0611919157856906
Furthermore, it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect Turkey, in view of that country' s proximity to the existing territory of the European Union. It also affects other states neighbouring the EU with which we maintain relations.	1.498010049239396
We understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them, particularly during the discussions that we will be having with Turkey to define that country' s own pre-accession strategy agenda.	1.3103487469413087
This question will naturally be one of our key concerns, and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account.	1.5497839051932993
Thank you, Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council.	0.9599005372447387
I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog.	1.15335461030579
However, forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me.	1.3933733106313848
I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately.	1.3978853411596743
Will you please therefore undertake, before the next plenary in February, to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public, immediately the Council has passed legislation, rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list.	1.3913011584952348
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information?	0.9027645940340937
Mr Newton Dunn, I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question, and I would be grateful if you could refrain from making such comments in future.	1.1958416036580624
With regard to what you were saying, it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the Council, apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note, does not actually refer to the opacity, shall we say, of the legislative process, but rather almost to an excess of transparency.	1.5258720308218794
However, I would like to say, Mr Newton Dunn, that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable.	1.509887690479051
We have no problem, Mr Newton Dunn, in repeating this information to you in writing, but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here, because that meets the requirements of the Treaty exactly.	1.5977734504469054
We therefore consider that the General Secretariat of the Council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the Council' s functions as a legislative body.	1.2777261069252748
I do not consider that the Council tried to answer my question.	1.2271347045238779
I did not ask what the Council thought of the proposal which the Commission has still not tabled.	1.4548608336230497
Instead, my question concerns the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1.1673880880958207
Does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the European Union referred to there?	1.3750815501763072
I should like to have an answer to that question.	1.2338852216712486
Does the Council consider that, on the basis of Article 255 of the Treaty, national legislation on transparency can be regulated, that is to say legislation not relating to the EU' s institutions?	1.243287151562842
Mr Sjöstedt, the answer that I gave was the only answer possible.	1.3100305090498863
Nevertheless, I would like to say that any interpretation of Article 255 of the Treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity.	1.097073233594829
At the moment, there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article, and unless there is such a proposal, we cannot move forward on this matter.	1.3856370031729806
In any event, Article 255 does not, at first sight, allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity.	1.3461744212500724
I am, up to a point, concerned about how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process.	1.1871437360828676
How is this to be done when, at the same time, the Commission' s proposal - which has been leaked, so the general public is aware of it - says that employees' freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working documents, reports, drafts etc?	1.2782697636286606
Does not the Council' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process?	1.4042179644353785
Mrs Frahm, the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference.	1.29257995182725
I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions "outwards" , it also applies between the institutions.	1.4963295744484921
By this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions, and not only as regards the Commission' s relationship with Parliament, but also as regards the Commission' s relationship with the Council.	1.5097220703020775
As a matter of fact, at the last conference, this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions.	1.4446446231665881
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference.	1.205295133842982
The matter is still open.	0.7864231395709305
Genuine transparency of the institutions' workings and the way they are presented throughout Europe is an extremely important issue and one which, in my opinion, needs to be studied again, particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	1.301278184130019
We have no doubts about this and we think that the Members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again.	1.23952727181355
I believe that the Commission' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function, but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter.	1.509956039561574
For our part, we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area.	0.9931476912673224
It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjöstedt and others have asked.	1.1288701343236283
We have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens, decision makers and authorities.	1.1822136912094188
We are very anxious indeed that the EU, too, should move in this direction, and this is also stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1.4062976427246936
One or two years ago, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Lööw which is extremely important in this context.	1.2969634005990447
The report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States.	0.854728601664093
We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament.	1.1073158438831319
I want to ask the Council if it understands this warning, in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the Commission.	1.4486462175438668
I listened very carefully to what Mr Seixas da Costa had to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.1044930748106023
My concern is, if I have understood Mr Seixas da Costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the IGC, whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widening the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2899605936522918
After all, examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobbies.	1.1072908340613523
It should have its own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference, which would mean widening the agenda.	1.1026450587085792
Mr Dimitrakopoulos, transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions.	1.2016838829391914
This Intergovernmental Conference will, at the outset, concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate, particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic, more transparent and more efficient.	1.3432017891920336
All of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims.	1.2001981190034998
It is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the European agenda and it will, of course, feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference.	1.3538512372663285
I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference.	1.2720699953993169
It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament, who will surely rally behind this proposal.	1.1347135654099765
We will then see, at ministerial level, how we can follow this up.	1.3038376503360831
It should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the Treaty of Amsterdam, which was approved last May, and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress.	1.5148605487737028
The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency.	1.3312159339333407
My feeling is that, in spite of everything, this issue will always have to be on the agenda, because the public is clearly concerned about it, and because it is linked with the need to make the European institutions accountable to the public.	1.4909793737018222
As far as we are concerned, they will be.	1.168829464033635
We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter.	0.8175680431335942
Question No 5 by (H-0785/99):	0.779161659391824
Subject: Proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000, and the case of anchovies in particular The latest reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ICES zone VIII is critical.	1.3260880461128786
Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France (5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future?	1.215838829735947
Does the Council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established TAC of 33 000 metric tonnes per year, given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks?	0.9948982990370389
What measures does the Council intend to adopt, and when, with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks, the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability?	1.2234407872769724
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question, particularly because it broaches an issue which concerns Portugal in a positive way, and I shall explain how.	1.436375738471402
The Council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refers.	1.1053753305331258
Nevertheless, at the last Fisheries Council of 1999, held on 16 and 17 December, the Member States involved in this area of fishing, namely France, Spain and Portugal, considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes, as the Commission proposed, was excessively cautious.	1.4576025073013592
A compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks, that is the species of fish being affected, and the socio-economic problems caused by fishing limits. This was achieved by fixing the TAC at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999.	1.253526217235346
It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species, of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year.	1.4489537096835856
As for the Southern stocks of anchovy in ICES zone IX, the TAC was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999.	1.1149768023039732
Fishing quota transfers between Portugal and France were reduced proportionally from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000, for fishing in French waters.	1.034306892346465
I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall, over the whole Community fishing area.	1.2688197612296623
In accordance with the principle of relative stability, 90% of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10% to France.	0.9688299224125226
Without this transfer from Portuguese waters, the level of the Bay of Biscay TAC would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to France.	1.1574543201064045
That is why I think that this is quite positive from Portugal' s point of view.	1.0994145713376304
This situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, which we also understand.	1.1879750001712803
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all.	0.8540597598199743
I understand that Portugal is affected by this.	0.9656927597428222
However, it seems to go against all reason and intelligence that 80% of the anchovies, which, until 1995, were being fished in the Portuguese fishing grounds, through an agreement between that Member State - Portugal - and France, should now be fished in the Bay of Biscay and that the Council of Ministers wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay or the Cantabrian Sea.	1.4360198645350115
It has been shown, as we have been claiming since 1995, that this move is appalling, and, if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement, that is fine by us, but these anchovies should be fished in Portuguese fishing grounds and not in the Bay of Biscay.	1.4427699017657585
Today, scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay is in danger of extinction, and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that Bay.	1.2055125420125754
I do not know if you are aware, representatives of the Council of Ministers, of your responsibility over these last few years, and in 2000 as well, for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular.	1.4229536993843017
I would like to say, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, that in its judgement of 5 October 1999, the European Court of Justice ruled that this transfer, which was approved, was in accordance with the principles laid down in Council Regulation 37/60/92 and, specifically, with its Article 9(1), which stipulates that Member States may exchange all or part of the fishing rights that they have been allocated.	1.4786581845552644
The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in zone VIII had been maintained at 90% and France' s at 10%.	1.0585850645090984
Apart from this, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and freshwater resources in a rational and responsible way, on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones VIII and IX neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to Spain.	1.1798536419069805
Accordingly, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer, greater account would be taken of France' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay.	1.2950785377368026
The Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen.	0.9937286266046829
In concrete terms, 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999.	0.9847746362034363
These numbers represent, in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council, a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80% laid down in Council Regulation 685/95.	1.2962533294142458
Question No 6 by (H-0788/99):	0.6291559595303434
Subject: Measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999, NATO's Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's minority communities.	1.19472107930269
In its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies, Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244.	1.0912963746529174
The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings, abductions, detentions, intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc.	0.873941024996718
In the light of the above, will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as requested by Parliament?	1.3311919140490636
What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing?	0.8582717837994651
Mr Alavanos, I would like to say that I have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised.	1.1526797966749596
We genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities, for both the Serb and Romany populations, and the incidents of discrimination, harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region.	1.2153652196140619
The Council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts.	1.1083556815561264
The Council once again reiterated the need, in its December conclusions, to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and, in particular, to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented.	1.230881287671843
In our contacts with senior political figures amongst the Kosovo Albanians, we have stressed - and the Portuguese Prime Minister did this very recently - that persecution of the Serb population, the Romany population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable.	1.3780706449115159
It will not be tolerated, and must stop immediately.	1.3972099456860347
It has been communicated explicitly and repeatedly to Kosovar leaders that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-Albanian minorities are treated.	1.0748892467988278
I think that this is an extremely important point: this sense of conditionality, which underlies the European Union' s position, is being maintained by the Council and will continue to be maintained.	1.5037705456873725
We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security forces in Kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat.	1.0618276391687005
KFOR and the UNMIC police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of maltreatment on the grounds of a person' s ethnic origin.	1.0207755693731115
The Council therefore expressed its satisfaction, in its December conclusions, at the substantial contributions announced by the European Commission, which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal, together with similar contributions made by Member States.	1.310633811588426
Nevertheless, Mr Alavanos, the Council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in Kosovo does not match the desired amount, in terms of what the various Member States have been able to raise, and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground.	1.505277781332835
We shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authorities and of the organisations representing Albanians in the region also depends on the ability of these organisations to prove themselves capable of implementing measures which will guarantee the region' s multi-ethnic nature.	1.1168724180252603
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council.	0.7801025837828753
I believe - as I think we all do - that Portugal, its former president, Mr Soares, and its government, maintained a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombings in the Balkans.	1.4799106391251298
Today' s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed, and one which I welcome.	1.5533665715856957
However, there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the European Union.	1.3176497632996182
Unfortunately, we have recently witnessed the eradication of Serb, Romany, Turkish, and Croatian minorities in Kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next.	1.5143431371868854
The United Nation' s, and Mr Kouchner' s, mission in Kosovo ended in failure.	1.2328556426982746
This failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was waged to put an end to ethnic cleansing, we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side.	1.1340314501271884
And so I would like to repeat my question as to whether the Council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr Kouchner, who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today.	1.400620501186902
Mr Alavanos, I cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on Mr Kouchner' s responsibilities, and I would like to make two very important points here. The structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the auspices of the United Nations.	1.34628163518252
It is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contributed in various ways.	1.506492429447737
There is one thing, however, that we cannot deny, and that is that Mr Kouchner' s efforts to return Kosovo' s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive.	1.3891153210339395
This is undeniable, even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts, for reasons beyond Mr Kouchner' s control, have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be.	1.4453549246017976
I have one last point to make, which is about the European Union' s responsibility and, specifically, in this case, about possible action by the Council in this matter, and the responsibility of the international community, which has overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo.	1.65762777132496
Therefore, the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context.	1.5488616654041953
It is the international community, and specifically the United Nations, which should be held responsible for implementing Resolution 12/99 and, in particular, for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality.	1.5013849030756312
These are questions which we should all be asking, but the forum for putting these questions is the United Nations.	1.3007726176619934
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures, in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities.	1.3355434969372713
I think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public.	1.2199150627009574
The question which I therefore ask myself is this: has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area, how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence?	1.2353139751971627
We have endeavoured to provide material help.	0.6044895531483876
We have tried to defend peace by taking military action.	0.7669101826946789
What is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here?	1.1602333841641925
Mr Rübig, as I said, I understand your concerns very well.	1.4305366793898067
I think that, at the moment, particularly in the last few months, there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr Kouchner, in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently.	1.5131381637471
I heard Mr Kouchner speak at the Council of Europe ministerial meeting on this issue, and I think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed. In other words, he has been given these resources.	1.3420047779295097
There are two fundamental questions in particular.	1.031823454983505
Firstly, an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and, in particular, in protecting certain sections of the civilian population. Secondly, an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in Kosovo to be kept on.	1.3715259988170359
The issue which we should all raise, and I did so myself, in a diplomatic way, a while ago, concerns the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12/99.	1.4811854791227956
I know that this is an extremely delicate issue, but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented.	1.3655641388663944
We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety.	1.137815177761469
Nevertheless, we must look at this resolution, and this is also something that the United Nations Security Council will probably have to do sooner or later. We will have to do so because, as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world, we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process, and a certain kind of logic and balance - which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved - should be maintained in future.	1.6017046353428206
What we have to do, and we in the European Union are already doing it, is to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resources, and you are right, Mr Rübig, we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used.	1.6258344269110003
We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency.	1.4304627814437758
Mr Seixas da Costa, I totally agree with you.	1.2816070844809735
The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working, namely Resolution 1244.	1.3221427260381453
Having said this, the EU' s responsibility, which is both yours and ours, is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region.	1.3648698281265066
It is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses, accidents and assassinations mentioned by Mr Alavanos.	1.074274622756307
Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo?	1.0553281889943844
If so, does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States, as has tended to happen elsewhere, and reuniting the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania?	1.451076513488878
Question No 8 by (H-0796/99):	0.6269070709831056
Subject: New INTERREG Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTERREG entitled: Promotion of urban, rural and coastal development, the Commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy.	1.244827676760734
However, housing is specifically excluded.	1.297013275934412
Given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest, including small cottages, and, given the need, for a variety of reasons, to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas, does not the Council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by INTERREG?	1.3390739701876262
Mr President, the Council and, I think, the Portuguese Presidency in particular, are extremely aware of the importance of the problems Mr Gallagher' s question raises and I would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas.	1.5334626207118363
I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development.	1.1366987645450322
This was, as you know, one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level.	1.127495878198921
Through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund, the EAGGF, this Community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas, an issue you are quite right to raise.	1.2470757454624304
On the other hand, the European Regional Development Fund, the ERDF, also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion, by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion.	1.403364349117453
In this regard, we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas.	1.0878104579893302
This combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today, furthermore, is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also, have developed and changed.	1.5469788177574881
We think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multifunctionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy, and the EAGGF, of course, has a crucial role to play in this.	1.3858131062386696
Question No 9 by (H-0798/99):	0.6277874562312548
Subject: Farming and the Portuguese Presidency Will the Council outline the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy and indicate the steps it feels are necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sectors and products adversely affected by recent health scares?	1.258714727377458
Your question on the common agricultural policy is one which we take very seriously and which should always be considered in this House' s discussions, because in the future we are likely to discuss this issue at great length.	1.4137670221803669
During the Portuguese Presidency, we will be continuing discussions on the CAP, by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the Union' s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers' incomes, paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family-run farms.	1.3409989289884567
On the other hand, the Portuguese Presidency will continue, if and when the new WTO round begins within its term of office, which is by no means guaranteed, to ensure that the presence of Community production on international markets is strengthened. It will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported Community farm products and preserving the multifunctional European agriculture to which I have just referred.	1.3279988131670464
The Portuguese Presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already referred to this aspect this morning.	1.2744164941212421
We think that the role of food safety, specifically in terms of everything linked to public health, is one of our presidency' s essential tasks. It is therefore one of the priorities of our programme.	1.4962089584813782
We shall be developing it in four parallel schemes, in the Agriculture Council, the Health Council, the Consumer Affairs Council and the Internal Market Council.	1.6588251320879097
At the Santa Maria da Feira European Council meeting in June, the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission presented in its White Paper a few days ago.	1.3159382224472569
We think that the task we now have of establishing a European agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market, to stabilise confidence in this market, to break down some of the tensions between Member States in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the European Union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety.	1.5992159861426642
This is what we shall be trying to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope, at the end of it, to be able to present the result of our efforts to this House.	1.4063949228066694
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.	0.9523082536221569
I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the European model which is based on family farming, mainly those farmers involved in beef and sheepmeat production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs.	1.2783909894222982
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks, in particular, against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where, of course, European standards of food safety do not apply.	1.2945882946783704
I completely understand your concerns, and I feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the European Union itself on this issue.	1.382684926253251
We also have to think of the consequences, especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers.	1.0720511678649416
Nevertheless, as you know, this issue is now in the hands of the European Commission and it will have to take this further.	1.7874291442042112
The Council' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited.	1.246820922118731
Mr President, I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber.	1.0793219594500818
But I do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field.	1.1425480683421732
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency.	1.076970593191246
My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level.	1.1208094478427344
I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role, even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States.	1.2338679236782382
Mr Crowley, with regard to the presidency' s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations, particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless, I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome, and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them.	1.1434861025350282
We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency, which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme.	1.0928614521860838
We have no specific, concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency.	1.3548463010867637
It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council' s scope for action.	1.1600152711373553
Any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself.	1.3264477294242139
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have talked a lot about the future, about what the Commission will do, and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon, etc. However, you also said something which I find particularly frightening.	1.3928547023616522
You said that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development.	1.0183274562431017
I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead, partially at least, to exclusion.	1.1410182317145043
I do not see how you could, with the views that you hold, provide any answers.	1.4512276438114855
What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following: what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on, for example, the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion, the division of work and social security, the implementation of tax policies, particularly for speculative capital, and the policy of redistributing wealth?	1.4554162467669955
I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters.	1.3734678662396993
You must understand that a presidency' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited.	0.9675982579872674
I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission' s own scope for intervening, through its right of initiative.	1.3659657942626642
I have spoken about the Special European Council and about Portugal' s initiative in convening it, and I have spoken about the future, because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion.	1.3004892551456462
One of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion. The second is to create internationally competitive conditions, which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union, and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion.	1.30724568286862
The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can, in six months, resolve problems that have always existed.	1.2911819215118825
It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence.	1.3779891414423202
It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented, specifically by non-governmental organisations, but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters.	1.257807401706621
We should, however, also bear in mind, Mr Papayannakis, that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact, armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months.	1.4248959241653052
We therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies, regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term, some of the homeless may be dead, will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union.	1.273573099947534
We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency.	0.8891718604567
Question No 12 by (H-0801/99):	0.7813743157619235
Subject: Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy, the Convention of Lomé and tackling famine situations?	1.2573987701738694
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question, and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position.	1.3301723421534124
But there are some questions still outstanding.	1.1023343718866006
There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme.	1.0510981509410937
The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict.	1.0322773130241116
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue.	1.0790479070864227
Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa.	1.335426669338125
I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought, where the crops have failed, and where, in six months' time, we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands.	1.3289554720855492
At the same time, there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns, after which we will send the bread.	1.2082038824114745
First of all, Mr Andrews, you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development. There is no contradiction between our two positions, quite the opposite.	1.4640282394085993
Unless we wish to act like megalomaniacs, we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face, particularly in the area of external relations.	1.1959004771816226
As you can understand, it would be easy to do so.	1.3152003056052046
All we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme, one after the other.	1.397195143180677
We are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments' ability to act and within the scope of the Council.	1.3110181996785304
We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve, particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes.	1.301510740651755
You have mentioned Ethiopia, which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes, but there are, as you know, several Community actions to combat AIDS, and in this respect, you are right, and the United States will probably not do any better.	1.4391994122154528
Indeed, in terms of development aid policy, I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the United States.	1.4031684821560795
Your question switched to the subject of arms, a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will, of course, address in the future, if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context.	1.4679008923058112
Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the EU to developing countries at prices below the cost of production?	1.3094250331773638
Does the presidency intend to do anything about this?	1.0284651849922428
Since the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses.	0.7015069417398793
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, and I would personally like to welcome him and the Portuguese Presidency.	1.0456724230227528
Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs.	0.9925475982143059
Unfortunately, in my case, he did not provide what I would call a satisfactory answer.	1.6445576022617316
Since the Council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset, it should, in my view, demonstrate this in practice.	1.2856983707664449
Saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is, I am afraid, just an excuse.	1.5438795352098345
My question, which has not been answered, is why, when the European Parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the European Union, the Council and the Commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether.	1.4532153246247659
This is a true example of the Council' s indifference towards culture, despite its assurances to the contrary that it is a matter to which it attaches great importance.	1.572022081756265
I would therefore like to ask the Council if it is prepared henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it supported bananas, hops, cows and Indian hemp.	1.037830613754646
Mr Marinos, we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the Portuguese Presidency, and therefore, the cultural dimension is, I am sure you will appreciate, one of our main concerns.	1.5193155686992403
These cultural dimensions, however, almost always have their own economic dimension in turn, that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives.	1.2906406410725366
This is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the European Union, and especially within the framework of the Council.	1.3946590852644318
For our part, we shall be attempting to strengthen and consolidate the European position on cultural goods and services and on activities in this sphere, because we believe that this is an identifying feature which is crucial to the Union' s image and to the Union' s own particular identity.	1.3656116425061176
This is, and will continue to be, connected with developments within the World Trade Organisation.	0.9914763412290352
As you know, both we and the Council have addressed this issue appropriately.	1.2605642822582033
In specific terms, we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the Commission for the next round of WTO negotiations, at which this will be a central issue.	1.5344787925217642
Nevertheless, I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy, and in particular the audiovisual dimension, the Portuguese Presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching European audiovisual policy by adopting a Media-Plus programme which could go some way towards allaying Europe' s main fears.	1.2503289858897695
We also intend to initiate a new debate, a more innovative one, on the issue of Europe' s film heritage, given that this must be one of the most important factors in the development of a European cultural identity and of a European audiovisual economy.	1.2811063315028042
The Presidency will also concentrate on discussions about creating a digital television system in Europe, which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organising during the Portuguese Presidency, in conjunction with the Commission, in February 2000.	1.373181770169042
But, Mr Marinos, in the EU context, culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with IGC agendas.	1.5699174738358417
If, by chance, it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, then this could be suggested, both by Member States, and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the preparatory group.	1.475265696078241
Of course, if consensus could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference, there might eventually be progress.	1.5009451219537153
It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this.	1.1244417797544122
We will soon see, and for our part, we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue.	1.581820540793581
Mr President, I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency.	1.1100403259267035
I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it, you would consider it.	1.3603740478924875
Well, I, and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it.	1.3630156676148664
I appreciate that it is a provocative question.	1.2441183205872803
It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves.	1.1505428597558136
We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens.	1.224088391556038
I cannot think of a better way to do it.	1.0739496597868743
Can you?	-0.0
The issue is whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the Treaties.	1.202884771081852
This is an issue which, as you will understand, will have to be addressed at IGC level and is an issue that only a Special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue, because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place.	1.494361494730029
Intergovernmental Conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree.	1.0132539980747939
It is therefore not out of the question that these issues, which crop up again and again, and which are passed from one conference to another, may be addressed.	1.4886484589745808
The problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue being included, particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included, other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference' s agenda.	1.3287927185335635
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion.	0.6597618915708906
I would ask him to be brief.	1.0144012557403543
Mr President, I understand that I have to do this very quickly.	1.9431929417637797
I liked what Mr Seixas da Costa said about Father Christmas.	0.8443660825513888
In Spain they say a letter to the three kings.	0.6226345072574656
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports.	1.129155434493176
Now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings.	1.2196988854771207
As I suspected, it was not exactly a procedural motion, but more a closing of the debate.	1.451787171056243
We thank Mr Seixas da Costa, but he can also write his letter to the three kings.	1.0284957940331998
I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one.	1.1725267989500998
The problem is that in this case Father Christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so.	1.1767047862093414
It is not the Portuguese Presidency' s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants, especially those that the European Parliament is asking for.	1.4301615921321862
After this interesting exchange of opinions, and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I would like to tell you that Questions Nos 17 to 27 will be replied to in writing.	1.1041904052825708
That concludes questions to the Council.	0.5392710792590588
Capital tax	-0.0
The next item is the joint debate on:	0.5092735916158166
the oral question (B5-0004/2000) by Mr Désir and others, to the Council, on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax	1.2467879225744392
the oral question (B5-0005/2000) by Mr Désir and others, to the Commission, on the Commission position on the idea of a capital tax.	1.235945436222885
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, during the Asian crisis in 1997, as with those which hit Mexico in 1995 or the EMS in 1993, everyone could see the damage caused to the economies of entire countries by financial speculation, particularly currency speculation.	1.1353228594119151
Between EUR 1 500 and 2 000 billion are traded every day on the financial markets. In three or four days, this can equal the total figure of annual global production, or global GDP, of approximately EUR 6 000 billion.	1.3244758479364012
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments.	0.8801426468424378
Yet the erratic movement of these massive sums of capital can, in a few hours, cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country, plunging its whole population into recession.	1.3142811007675506
In view of this situation, renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by James Tobin, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, to create a tax on currency transactions. The rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments, but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation, thereby checking the multiplication of short-term transactions.	1.2939618250703016
Note that this proposed tax, which seems to be producing strong emotions in some people, would be the lowest tax in the world and the lowest in the history of global taxation. Yet it would represent the recapture of the areas seized from democracy by the financial sphere.	1.3091434417536323
One reason for the acceptance of this proposal, and of the campaigns by NGOs such as ATTAC, SOLIDAR or others which have popularised this proposal, is that it would release resources which could be allocated to development programmes in the poorest countries, in areas such as education or health.	1.2956641760737848
It could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty.	0.9692776527469301
Many personalities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the Brazilian President, Fernando Cardoso, the Finnish Government, the Canadian Parliament last March and also Lionel Jospin in 1995.	1.407607390729047
This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU.	0.8833106678860503
The common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the European Union. This is the reason for the oral question to the Council and Commission which we have tabled with 37 other Members.	1.4212029577752328
I am delighted with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reached with the GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA, ELDR and PSE Groups.	1.1941969713394596
This motion asks the Commission to present a report to Parliament within six months on the feasibility of this tax. It also asks for an examination of the pressures and financial sanctions which could be applied against countries which encourage tax evasion or which maintain tax havens.	1.19452696971989
One of the most common objections is that such a tax would be too complex, but this could be said of any tax. If this argument had been accepted in the past, then no taxes would ever have been created.	1.5520088300049433
The motion also asks that a position document, drawn up by the Commission and Council, should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the IMF.	1.3197046509474324
The European Union must take the initiative and must also, as demanded in the motion, propose this initiative to the G7 because it is primarily a political question.	1.4350003527180821
If the Union takes the initiative, this will have a ratchet effect because this debate is occurring all over the world, including in the USA and Japan. A desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by traders but by the people, their parliaments, their governments and their democratic institutions.	1.4205582976229945
Europe must play a role in this new international regulation and I am extremely happy that today, with this debate and this motion, this question is now on the agenda of European construction.	1.578945125673531
Madam President, I do not have a great deal to add on this subject.	1.3376441465531705
The Council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as Professor Tobin suggested.	1.0155200626285275
This is a creative initiative, which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in European politics, but the Commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue.	1.512622077717806
As it falls to the Commission to propose any such initiative, the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue.	1.5725363440050464
Madam President, the revenue basis of the Tobin tax is said to be made up of very short-term exchange transactions.	1.3474147673632404
Such transactions, according to the argument, bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables. This has also just been underlined by Mr Désir.	1.1583564741969714
Therefore, according to proponents, such as Mr Désir, an internationally applied Tobin tax would, in principle, reduce speculative transactions and, hence, the volatility of exchange rates, which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity.	1.4768149108416884
Taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial streams, even a low nominal Tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue.	1.134218588040439
In reality, the motive underlying the increased interest in the Tobin tax and other sources of international finance in the mid-nineties was non-economic.	1.06538540632861
Indeed, it was fuelled by the potential of this tax to generate income for international, public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was rising quickly and funding was increasingly harder to come by.	1.307723362836156
The Commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax, such as the Tobin tax, as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation, so to speak.	1.2370311427913256
Mr Désir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides.	0.7287819594413177
But if the Tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency, then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market.	1.320389484711124
Put more strongly, in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds, the Tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens.	1.1962445455528028
In that case, the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity.	1.0674620144641702
So the Tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate.	1.1628245343490946
Finally, even if the Tobin tax is designed to curb speculations with currencies, there is still the risk that even non-speculative streams would be affected, and that is not the intention.	1.467750847131812
For the reasons set out above, I cannot see a good reason for introducing a European Tobin tax.	1.2618473416205445
At any rate, the Commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the European Union.	1.0996271164478983
In more direct terms, to the extent that this measure could be deemed an indirect restriction on capital streams, this would contravene the Treaty of Rome.	1.2205307913587065
The correct speculative approach, it seems to me, is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos, rather than attempting to suppress its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets.	1.1311732569138924
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like once again to say a few words on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question.	0.9982209617106554
Also because I know how many social democrats in this House share our criticism, and not just the economic and financial policy experts.	1.4553303230671348
We know what the problem is: instability on the markets as the result of speculation.	1.079484439801633
But the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability, as the Commissioner has just so impressively told us, is the result of speculation.	1.3509907627149074
The Tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the EEA in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south-east Asian currencies in 1997.	1.1582423927916015
The initiators of this question do not propose a solution; instead they are calling for a new burden, they are calling for more bureaucracy, for a measure which runs counter to the market mechanisms and they are taking up plenary' s time with an intergroup opinion which excludes the competent parliamentary committee, contrary to several resolutions by Parliament.	1.1772702737229652
In my view, and I say this quite clearly, the question is ideologically motivated rather than solution-focused.	1.4434514696877248
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons.	0.9141028831660354
Why do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so questionable?	1.0795240958494643
First, and the Commissioner has also confirmed this, because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets.	1.6309389608690745
Even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets, because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably.	1.109351365090197
In addition, this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial markets and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital, which is one of the central tenets of the internal market.	1.333972516089452
Secondly, speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify.	1.2651624355237916
Thirdly, unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time, tax measures are easy to circumvent because there are otherwise too many loopholes.	1.112252336973358
Fourthly, technically speaking, this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control.	1.2618679486480788
The measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today.	1.3097971406477158
We need stronger banking supervision.	0.502784005171857
We need to clarify the liability for transactions.	0.9517118443964202
We need a framework of regulations at international level.	1.1662905358579545
We need to examine national laws in order to check that they comply with the rules of the Basle committee and how the dissemination of these rules can be stepped up.	1.14598989896035
I have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands.	1.5471880241715825
I refer to point 9.	0.8495802308705774
Having listened to the Commissioner just now, we know that the Commission' s knowledge of the facts will result in a 'no' to the Tobin tax.	1.2605377193845426
If the knowledge of the facts and this debate and the arguments are as we say, and I think that they are right, then to take up another six months of the Commission' s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital markets would be irresponsible.	1.4893194519891746
The capital markets do not want uncertainty from us, they want clarity; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote.	1.4021554793736806
Madam President, the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one.	1.3333977164167172
We have been discussing the Tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies.	1.2172328558204408
We need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is.	1.0212374334834373
This question has now entered a different dimension, a dimension in which USD 1 500 billion roam the world twenty-four hours a day looking for attractive investments, no more than 3% of which have anything to do with the real economy.	1.2638000944555818
We are concerned about stability on the financial markets, not for the sake of the financial markets, but because this has to do with own growth, our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union.	1.4552173325630429
We must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past.	1.2209725460271001
We have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions, but so far we have had no working set of rules, as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the Asian and Latin American crises.	1.3120036333703595
It is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information.	1.1767132983628041
It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is.	1.1604379859118994
We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice.	1.4102399851405438
At a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout Europe and internationally, we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short-term financial transactions.	1.3772474812071096
I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the Commission, so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achieves real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure.	1.5065180713470332
This is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal.	1.2243819998447214
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which, although it does not mention it in the text, appears to be an attempt to revive, as the introduction has done, the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by Mr Tobin, which our Group opposed, clearly and totally, during the last legislature, with a series of arguments clearly and coherently expressed by our President, Mr Cox.	1.3351898593899554
I will have to repeat these arguments, modestly, in this intervention, because the same issue has arisen once again.	1.3242630418506813
We do not agree with this type of tax because its application, in the event that it could happen, would not achieve the aims which Mr Tobin presented at the time and which the Left in this House wishes to revive.	1.4657812659225409
Firstly, there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets.	1.2452243575492008
On the contrary, since it is certain that not all countries would accept it, we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility, instability, insecurity, opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level.	1.272363730030099
Furthermore, the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity, when we consider their application in practice, that it appears simply impossible.	1.3985378809059417
This is a false debate whose aim is purely political, and has no basis or technical viability.	1.3441517709362354
Furthermore - since we are in this European Parliament - if we have still not managed the slightest agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measures proposed by the Commission within the European Union, how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level?	1.4740453870676902
I suppose that the first thing they say will be, 'let us see whether you are capable of reaching a fiscal agreement within the Union' .	1.3377399505748044
However, the Liberal Group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and, therefore, we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and suitability of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements.	1.4122281365125378
I am sure that this study - if carried out objectively, with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level - will show that it is neither suitable nor possible, not only in terms of its application, but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives.	1.4434500731889264
In itself, globalisation is positive.	0.696440885327996
The economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level.	1.0046232367109358
This is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital.	1.0436718737750408
Any analysis of economic development in recent years, if objective, will show, through the figures, that they have no political colour or orientation.	1.5250437151993632
As I have said, we are not opposed to such a study.	1.1411896543073774
We will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study, but we simply insist that, as this motion for a resolution points out, it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress, both on the level of states and on a general level.	1.506113007220129
Madam President, Commissioner, the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature.	1.2334707516014987
As Mrs Randzio-Plath said, we must remember that the reason why certain Members want to revive this question is because of the recent international financial crises and their economic, social and environmental consequences which have been felt by all in some countries.	1.2718081364091403
The main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabilising the international financial and monetary system.	1.3660399464258872
In this respect, Mr Bolkestein, the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the Tobin tax.	1.244373530999943
If you look carefully, this proposed tax on capital is just one of several instruments aimed at forcing international investors to behave responsibly on the financial markets.	1.077778155231432
Secondly, the motion does not say that we want a solely European initiative.	1.4569222381019895
This is why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund so that the European Union, in other words the Commission and also the Council, can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabilise the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation.	1.4453763306495844
There should be no confusion in this debate. As environmentalists, we do not want an excuse for a motion.	1.4548703251121011
Although a study produced by the Commission would doubtless be interesting, we do not need another to add to those already available.	1.4536465767399749
We do need to obtain, from the Commission and the Council, in other words from each of the governments forming the Union, a clear, positive or negative, political stance. They must indicate whether they are ready to defend, within competent public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund in the first instance, the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system.	1.462011588782781
As for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty, very short-term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short-term financial assets.	1.1097960157170155
This argument is therefore not relevant.	0.8763300861666841
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments.	0.9899395217902904
However, I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion, but also paragraph 10.	1.5489870979134859
We clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund. We therefore demand, if this motion is adopted tomorrow, that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion.	1.4649157239573827
Madam President, my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today, particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about.	1.3911396964178016
Obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning.	1.237791829064694
Having said this, our Group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents. This invites the Commission to present a report within six months.	1.2730895164183849
The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative, even if it does so timidly, on this subject. However, I agree with the previous speaker that, if paragraph 9 were challenged, this motion would clearly lose its substance.	1.574606493809712
This debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising. What are the respective places of people and finance in today' s economy?	1.1919000567335294
USD 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world' s currency markets. This represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services.	1.1490368675758194
By putting finance at the helm, this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere.	1.1656351196151287
It has led to a growth in mergers, acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets.	0.8774436553950741
Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing.	0.6644992550506008
Openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries, to the point of collapse, as in Asia, Russia and Brazil.	1.216521602553502
Faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets, demand, as our motion recognises, is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world.	1.3667790261990271
No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information.	1.0452332501076511
In this respect, all ideas deserve to be considered, including the Tobin tax which is important, just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged.	1.2801810352790786
This tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy. It could release new resources for investment in people and, at a time when the UNDP estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year, it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs.	1.2228281063184525
When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators.	1.2727548450294448
The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this.	1.091863436346598
I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and, like Mr Désir and several other speakers, I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect.	1.4617107693383273
In any case, the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone.	1.401027322319632
Madam President, I too am delighted that we are having this debate. I only regret that it has been so long in coming.	1.5478549102170973
We know that each generation has, over the course of time, blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology. This is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism, but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations.	1.3370670597787497
Free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or, rather, the big mistake of our fin de siècle. This ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or, before that, the certainty, elevated to the status of a dogma, that the earth was flat.	1.2432896608544517
Our world is now dominated by a single logic or, I could say, a single god of money at work instead of people at work.	1.366793514903025
With a figure for trade in goods and services of FRF 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days' speculation, the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals.	1.0746520333473544
It is self-perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man, the rich as much as the poor. Yet it is the latter who, at the end of the day, are excluded from the majority of the world' s decision-making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently, and very aptly, by Jean-Pierre Chevènement as the globalised élites.	1.3389265684426703
It was natural that these élites would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeuvre, thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both illegitimate and irresponsible.	1.012142434172369
However, the people are fighting back, as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit. The leaders of the world, headed unfortunately by the European Commission, rushed forward submissively, hoping that their docility at the feet of the master of the world, Mr Clinton, would be enough to ensure them the scraps from the table.	1.3245593558383055
Yet they reckoned without the salutary reaction of the nobodies, both individuals and States. This reaction was more organised than previously, due in France particularly to the magnificent ATTAC network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular.	1.2264583765960282
The creation of this taxation, of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by Professor Lauré, could prove to be politically opportune, at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate. This is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of States.	1.2352524084619403
Madam President, although some of the aims of the Tobin tax are fairly worthy of support, introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union, as the first area of the world to do so, would sound the death knell for the European currency markets.	1.4933336899599658
If the world' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the Tobin tax, the fact that tax was liable to be paid in Europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas.	1.1371671043332139
This has already been made clear a number times in this debate.	0.9981665301316505
It is not enough that all the world' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme, as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries.	1.171504730638465
There should therefore be a universal application: it is not enough that the G7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved.	1.2083299514467234
On the other hand, it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking, I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tobin tax dream might as well be buried.	1.499774156934276
Furthermore, although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme, the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed.	1.3961271853509416
The world' s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used, for example, for a variety of well-meaning, UN-backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them.	1.1323301332616325
With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises, it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation.	1.1185682218020148
For that reason, as Mr Karas also said, we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value.	1.3991308557773368
This again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way.	1.0730803381069274
Although it seems a reasonable scheme, the Tobin tax is not without its problems, even if there should be agreement as to its implementation, which I do not believe there will.	1.520547468840468
It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information, and that the global economy will, in the future, rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital.	1.331786037486006
For that reason, the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity, which has nothing to do with the real economy.	1.2046319779453714
If this 'feedback' mechanism, which gives users the opportunity to make choices, were hampered by measures such as the Tobin tax, mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it.	1.285383329681974
Hence, as Mr Karas has stated to his credit, our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax.	1.2732028947189584
Madam President, I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders.	1.1887893307764377
It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary.	0.9656282910079117
In the last 30 years, the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times: firstly, total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading; secondly, annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350, that is, 1% of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99% are for speculation.	1.1023051021549357
The size, unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies.	0.9685005513007268
Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche, burying jobs, lives and industries across the globe.	0.8045094569951339
The only arguments against it are: firstly, it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world, in East Asia, Europe and Latin America.	1.4387845773930636
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy.	1.097245444686941
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators, stockbrokers and option traders.	0.9316823328965131
Of course, this cannot be done in one country; it cannot be done within the single currency area, but it could be done at international level with global cooperation.	1.5649737574078066
Europe, Japan and the US - the euro, the yen and the dollar, would constitute, in my opinion, such a block.	1.4713570468801218
I am disappointed in the EPP.	0.8429526677055111
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on.	0.8750170220238078
Yes, I am in favour of such a tax, but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow.	1.3564917448653786
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter, to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax.	1.3678110535389338
Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax, but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue.	1.2307498249324753
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind.	1.010963581773649
The tax has the support of 47% of the people in the UK, according to a recent survey by War on Want.	1.286570345161429
In France it has had enormous resonance, particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty.	1.2311605190020698
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament, the Council or the Commission.	1.334631928718749
There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than: "It has not been done before".	1.1658660242226484
In the new millennium, with new global problems requiring new global solutions, they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now, rather than why it has not been done in the past.	1.3258172914745263
Madam President, Commissioner, a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules.	1.1587640893640994
I have two or three points to make in this respect.	1.2241882663311738
One of the main demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was, rightly, the establishment of this type of tax, and this is not by chance.	1.4341481358099513
The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism.	1.0664080912188423
Everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects. The Members on the right should note this.	1.184607310218391
It symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south, particularly those in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in Seattle.	1.1904981721176886
In order to fully achieve its objective, the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries.	1.1295555659167875
This is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south.	1.2198760257588652
Madam President, we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted; we must also mention the fact, Commissioner, that 80% of these huge, daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days.	1.3283567613433533
We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares.	0.9318088405080616
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action.	0.9256973660437137
We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly.	0.803319068417195
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea.	0.9878082792198907
We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations.	1.09410157819608
Nor do I believe that this is impracticable.	1.2047397150048589
Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries, the other EU Member States, China, Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax?	1.3131191431247506
There must be an overriding economic interest.	0.8742213670074835
Why should it be impracticable, and it can be differentiated, to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions, all the so-called cash transactions, currency futures and options?	1.2985776006920735
Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive.	1.0319454449100105
Numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise, but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold.	1.2703586461768879
Madam President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago.	1.45363134179314
We are looking for solutions.	0.6533511847935213
Of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea.	1.294419420475532
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question.	1.0919214284000887
"The more progress is made towards trade liberalisation, the more rules are needed", as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle.	1.3091368664206608
He recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations.	1.128385691213087
Now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary, all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions.	1.1097238228528137
We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation.	1.3279018912258296
To continue would be economic suicide.	0.6215941402818844
Honourable Members, Commissioner, it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector, but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector.	1.4049557978113996
If we look at the private sector, however, we will find not only that this fabled 'financial stability' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.	1.1807071728773906
The debt burdens of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of Stock Exchange securities, the two main market stability indicators, have, for some time, been at danger levels, as the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe clearly illustrates.	1.4269317793764145
The fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains.	1.061032997265988
Speculative activities are growing beyond measure and are, in turn, generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious.	1.0271477777692528
Over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear, which, in turn, will result in a stock market and economic crisis.	1.1858840466046814
The danger is too great for us to ignore.	0.8123387643574645
We ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem.	0.9881619232812547
Modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the Tobin proposal and others, which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start.	1.3308507258469235
That is what we are lacking, Commissioner: the political will to make a start in tackling speculation.	1.387701749713316
No longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of, or for this fatalist approach towards, market forces as adopted by the liberals - and I am sorry that Mr Gasòliba I Böhm has left - as this will only lead to its ruin.	1.270299351361891
Madam President, Mr Bolkestein, the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable.	1.4420244628426353
We needed a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tobin tax means.	0.8535574625760475
You reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it.	1.0787234196330417
That the Right opposes taxes is quite understandable, except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions, or rather billions, into Switzerland.	1.3004287669237393
We all know that!	0.8733251633315795
But now I call on you, in all consciousness, to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital.	1.443805411878623
It has never been done in south-east Asia, it has never been done in Europe, and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria has left the chamber, given Austria' s financial record.	1.3927552923189979
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush!	1.0300831858809665
We need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene.	1.394533185384625
Madam President, I am totally appalled by the Commission' s, i.e. Mr Bolkestein' s, political ignorance!	1.608012305035747
He should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all!	1.0546613742124817
Madam President, I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre.	1.427130828555735
It is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades.	1.0772594877867405
If we continue down this path, and this is the ideology, and declare the financial markets to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy, then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions.	1.2773422296818542
Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested.	0.8511374472497945
We have asset inflation of global proportions.	0.6456229819511731
As a result, speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets, causing growing economic instability which, in turn, jeopardises the entire economy.	1.0401577821159511
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result.	1.1924082742149804
We can take action against this; it is possible.	1.4863587747673164
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last, not only by the Commission, but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe.	1.2692756965860685
That too is feasible.	0.6673684357788827
And then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble!	0.8392370761161904
It is not correct that the Tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer.	1.4410294312665857
The fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored.	1.0227562647534567
In short, we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other, because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results.	1.2673011966696814
Madam President, let us indeed tax money speculation: it does not produce anything new.	1.1795196066667666
The tax would be targeted at the right place: at the speculators.	1.112819691724008
Who is going to defend these speculators, when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax?	0.9810458613218322
Article 73 c of the Treaty establishing the European Union provides scope for taxation on transactions.	1.357600462990819
Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres, the tax havens, of which there are 62 in all.	1.2257133967386
The Union should make a tax pact, which any countries could initially be party to.	1.2361651258303719
The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems.	0.8713685978713369
It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect.	1.1037593613523424
The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries, and you see how we are today.	1.6514701154601417
The truth is the greatest problem is a political one: they do not want to tax capital, but raise personal taxation instead.	1.3543728838086613
In the end tax would politicise the global, undemocratic system of financial power.	1.043203977547712
Ladies and gentlemen, we must challenge the monopoly the world' s speculative elite have on planning the world' s economy by remaining outside the tax system.	1.2288398463364392
Madam President, may I begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and, above all of course, Mr Désir, for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening.	1.5356838738685943
Whatever one may think about the topic of debate, it is evident that it is an important one.	1.2534084463234823
This is why it has been around for years, and it is satisfying that the Commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response.	1.4173085494206075
I would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the Member of your Parliament, Mr Gasòliba.	1.4411964726627164
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon, and I share his view.	1.5701280031971143
I believe that globalisation has helped many countries which, so far, have been on the sideline of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and, as far as I am aware, no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade.	1.3814322907503613
In other words, as indeed already remarked by Mr Gasòliba, globalisation is, in my view, positive, and I am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years.	1.4212443997037079
A second remark made by Mr Gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates.	1.1676743688641356
I think that he is correct in this regard.	1.2962737959993165
I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates.	1.0214625548477732
I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks, and that is why I am reiterating them here.	1.2268960489300889
Madam President, could I furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other?	1.41704000480172
Surely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement.	1.2463362914206075
Madam President, I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting, in conjunction with my offices and colleagues, to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe, thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible.	1.3331784836197134
In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market, I am, in other words, opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions.	1.2601711456895972
You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would, in fact, impede international economic movement.	1.066046102303056
Once again, the Tobin tax is, in my view, at odds with the Treaty of Rome, and this is an important, theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening.	1.3961205952934035
Madam President, apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations, there are also practical objections to the Tobin tax, as already underlined by Mr Karas and other speakers.	1.517883062274859
It has unfortunately been observed, I have to say, that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures. This indicates how difficult these dossiers are.	1.3628107214838685
If we have not been able to reach agreement internally, I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners.	1.427215047325024
I think that this will be problematic.	1.0718908629830777
Madam President, Mr Jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets.	1.3638672001892305
I think, however, that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes. I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when, as already stated, the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome.	1.253704264856267
In order to remove these causes, one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question.	1.404874034522904
Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English 'good governance' ?	1.0218616306233548
Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates?	1.0650688472828649
That the markets for production factors, including the labour market, operate flexibly?	1.178737562030476
That is not always the case.	0.7755123239349023
So if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability, then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first.	1.2623223225667088
In addition - and this has also been mentioned already, for example by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm, but also by others - there is a need for more supervision.	1.4238079665843304
More supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally, for example by means of the IMF.	1.429854485786171
So I believe the best way to tackle the causes is by ensuring, on the one hand, that good governance is observed in the countries in question and that, on the other hand, there is more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapses.	1.473718533671235
Madam President, according to various Members of your Parliament, more funding should still be made available for major projects.	1.3859740394807414
For example, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler spoke in English about 'long-term capital for long-term projects' - this is an obvious issue.	1.4494746779834835
My reply to this is that, firstly, countries should honour their pledges, namely make 0.7% of their Gross National Product available for development aid and cooperation, so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long-term projects and via a route established for the purpose, namely contributions to development cooperation, and not via an artificial and probably harmful route, namely the Tobin tax.	1.390475273403913
Madam President, I should like to leave it here. As far as the resolution is concerned, of which I have seen a draft, the Commission will await the vote and will, based on this, determine its stance.	1.5108652568833685
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate.	0.7881124443751166
I have received four motions for a resolution, tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure.	1.0834504457185765
Madam President, unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language.	1.7498597934061781
But I would be obliged if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute, which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs Randzio-Plath.	1.4527200837644323
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him?	1.2817017708568978
Monsieur Bolkestein, je veux vous dire quelque chose!	0.6379585320555456
Unfortunately, my Dutch is not as good as yours.	1.4335448725868642
But I would rather like to say something else to you.	1.4909431266006397
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission.	1.0560877193075637
We want to examine the possibility of introducing a Tobin tax.	0.9490819168258509
It will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this.	1.1905867281654476
From a political point of view, I always fret when people say, we neither need, want nor can we achieve these things!	1.403871406638052
It is not your job, it is our job to decide on that.	1.4656252768299516
It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament.	0.9872747103278341
I just want to discuss it with you, no more and no less.	1.2891056389624544
We can do so without going off at other tangents. I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously.	1.1699196285384215
Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously, and that includes the Tobin tax!	1.381748271402217
Madam President, an omission appears to have been made. In the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out, no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the PSE, ELDR, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA Groups and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Coûteaux.	1.4483437192644617
Mr Désir, I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution.	1.1980142383771821
If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled, it will be included.	1.2845836485889073
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	0.29695966651602207

Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	0.4510321946745718
Mr President, I simply wanted to pass on some news. There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid.	1.198614702717074
Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died.	0.7677153890194329
On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts.	1.1337892406415198
Thank you, Mrs Fraga Estévez.	1.1414237124965447
We had heard about this regrettable incident.	0.6733861864013816
Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish.	1.4071916078509399
(The Minutes were approved)	0.08791063492812108
Resumption of the session	0.13474910339249976
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000.	0.7924979070371527
Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy.	1.1369301462222918
Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans.	1.0603252349524963
Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least.	1.3943718523014625
I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims' families.	1.3457936298660922
Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment.	1.033794427391403
Agenda	-0.0
The next item is the order of business.	0.8689733460833065
Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government.	1.3684353682955506
If you decide to add this debate to the agenda, it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission.	1.118108277688006
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	0.5755341742272282
Madam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents, and, since I publicly criticised the presidency in January, I would like to take this opportunity to say, both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we now find the presidency' s statements on this issue to be appropriate, and we agree on their basis, their importance and their form.	1.3421263352228576
Madam President, it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure.	1.3815546517770894
This debate is topical, exceptionally important and urgent.	0.9359956354545304
We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it.	1.3034608334744366
(Applause)	-0.0
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal?	0.579153275281996
Madam President, I shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which I consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the Treaties, and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1.3925732075951232
Madam President, until now we believed that the European Union was, according to the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Paris founding the European Communities, and subsequently the Union, an association of free, independent, sovereign states.	1.5504481679557744
Even though many developments cast doubt on this, we did believe, in spite of everything, that this was the case and, more recently, reference was made, albeit half-heartedly, to the principle of subsidiarity.	1.5745878436530427
Well, patently, if we do open this debate today, Madam President, as you are requesting and as the Conference of Presidents is requesting, on the basis of Rule 50, we shall then be opening up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments, enabling some other majority in this Parliament, at some future time, to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free, regular, peaceful and democratic elections within a Member State.	1.4193541147907422
If you ratify ...	0.6203718729768527
Mr Gollnisch, excuse me, you have one minute.	1.0778798574916144
I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure are observed.	1.1927348838071024
Madam President, I thought I had three minutes.	1.1347888626690774
Do forgive me.	0.3465618676446732
If you ratify this development, then you are ratifying the development of the Union into a body which violates the sovereignty and the freedom of the Member States, and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a Union.	1.3844853711637142
We have heard one speaker in favour and one against.	0.7499488972979528
I shall now, therefore, put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote.	1.2858407046133178
(Parliament gave its assent)	0.06492846330865369
This debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business.	0.8130506740838458
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	0.2004388419834845
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	0.4698836304410891
Talks in Austria on forming a government	0.15227902657532158
The next item is the debate on the talks in Austria on forming a government.	0.5664139645336326
I shall immediately give the floor to Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council.	0.6496642683279802
Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, the Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the European public.	1.0755852975679414
Let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts.	1.067353409216053
Firstly, we wish to express our total support for, and our solidarity with, the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the 14 Member States, because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values, and not just the political force, which we have all built together.	1.531602294515687
In any event, these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically known as the Austrian Freedom Party.	1.0549698444443343
The Europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered, and the Socialist Group condemns the insults which have been directed at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government, but also at the Socialists, who are European citizens as well, because, at the moment, the Austrian Socialists are being described as traitors to their country.	1.4239237149600168
I will say one thing. For many years I was a traitor to my country; at least that was General Franco' s view.	1.3471747147111548
President Guterres was also a traitor in Salazar' s eyes, and that is something that I believe should also be stated and defended by the PPE-DE.	1.227179721307316
I also believe that the Commission, or President Prodi, has acted as a guardian of the Treaties.	1.4042536966883903
However, I would remind him that, during his inaugural debate, he described the Commission as a European government.	1.6554453956795232
A government must have more nerve and more courage.	0.8563055217853931
That is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment.	1.3297796863343598
(Applause)	-0.0
With all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr Fischler, and given that we have heard contradictory comments, depending on the translation, with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resignation of Mr Fischler, I would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this House.	1.3909367052837955
Secondly, Madam President, we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people.	1.3308969725529238
This is an appeal to the majority of Austrians who have not voted for Haider, who have voted for the clearly democratic options, committed to Europe, and I must point out that Mr Schüssel may have been Minister for Finance, but Chancellor Vranitzky also contributed to Austria' s integration process.	1.355778032980651
We should not be so politically partisan.	1.0906008795036017
The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture.	1.2075534977983093
We all took part in it, not just one group.	1.2286010408940382
Therefore, Madam President, I believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reflect, because this type of menace, which we have suffered before in Europe, may not only harm Austria, but it may also spread, and I say this bearing history in mind.	1.4498020311488085
Therefore, apart from the apology which Mr Schüssel has made, offering us all kinds of guarantees, as did Chamberlain and Daladier in 1938 in Munich, I would like to know whether the PPE intends to implement measures in relation to the Austrian People' s Party, if it goes ahead with this mad project.	1.267798885767176
Thirdly, if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance, I can assure you that we can forget the European Union' s main objective - enlargement - because, if we were Czechs, Slovenes or Hungarians, what would we say, faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter?	1.4082874210938738
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to commence.	1.2164976091751067
We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option.	1.1400520791597302
(Applause from the PSE Group)	0.26895271987047414
Madam President, we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the Union, so that we can uphold them together.	1.3303949345548547
Instead, we have been forced to debate the formal, substantial errors that have been made in the last few days.	1.3326793960661742
We are astonished by the political naivety of people who, with thoughtless words, have bolstered Mr Haider' s position in Austria and made the Union look ridiculous, riding roughshod over Article 7 of the Treaty by announcing unconstitutional measures.	1.2985270890648197
We have never before seen such serious, clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	0.730585417734504
Of course, we cannot violate the founding values of Europe, and in this regard, the Italian Prime Minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty: he mentioned the Treaty of Copenhagen, which I, like you, have never heard of because it does not exist.	1.5815332873790433
Maybe he was referring to the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 6 of which lists certain principles and Article 7 certain procedures, in order to establish that a Member State is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in Article 6.	1.180822305739166
However, up till now, Austria has committed no serious or persistent violation.	1.380892308212091
Apart from amounting to interference, the statement by the Presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for.	1.0714214087812495
No political cohesion has so far come about, not even in the fight against organised crime, or in defence of the victims of genocide; we do not have a currency that is even remotely stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty; but it only took one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union' s credibility.	1.2388881130221179
Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated, but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government.	1.1523957943031948
Otherwise, how will we deal with Communist countries which return to Communism: will we throw them out of the Union too if Communists enter into government, or will Stalin' s grandchildren be forgiven for everything?	1.247389659479912
(Applause from the right) It is via diplomacy, persuasion, knowledge, and solidarity, and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles.	1.328453222474455
Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this.	1.2839538239071686
This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions.	1.366402027780188
So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region.	1.2621927593044457
However, we already knew this.	1.5081192060995063
However, today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union' s democratic role.	1.577192655586285
We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples, and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights.	1.28497393252133
We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union.	1.3480319814703248
This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks.	1.0011177806370328
We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics.	1.382143504817883
And these are the consequences!	1.15569446477918
Therefore, we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people, thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples.	1.3066717377053054
Madam President, today we have an appointment with hypocrisy.	1.3178898903768612
Here we have a Council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach.	1.05094790195873
In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria.	0.8043037563987898
There are risks, as we are all aware, but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach.	1.385466543431702
If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union, then, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them.	1.461520831607523
And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court.	1.430903645920753
We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway.	1.1651111291874332
We could, if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter.	1.3578853817229184
We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years, 13 years of party politics which has made one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten, just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy, Belgium and other European Union Member States.	1.2086475208798204
We might well wonder why 76% of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country' s system of justice, and 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice...	1.195647337547248
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
Madame President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are very concerned by this debate.	1.6904874648462975
We cannot, and we do not, support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich.	1.235602011585451
We also, however, deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country, especially one which is part of the European Union.	1.3613071090877888
My party at home are certainly not racists, but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well.	1.391872387092197
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain' s Parliament if we are elected?	1.0208382162067104
Madame President, the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament.	1.1650189931363752
I believe they gave him 28% of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government.	1.2878141249921389
Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country.	1.5237630417929853
Then, and only then, might you consider if human rights are affected.	1.3192082833501255
Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then, Madame President and only then, may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union.	1.1133972509971335
Madam President, as a representative of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria.	1.5291614748724824
My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one' s own past, and the stability of democracy.	1.3359605074824699
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly.	1.022711511749132
The refusal of our government, down through the years, to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War, together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour, have done a great deal to bolster this negative image.	1.157836209770452
This FPÖ has now entered into a coalition with the ÖVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office.	1.0654009218752871
This is the citizen of a state' s prerogative, for it is the founding principle of a democracy.	1.474210995036248
When the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for their support.	1.0651636322995173
We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here!	1.3269948960851317
When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day.	0.9695483586432367
The FPÖ party is established in Austria' s political landscape.	0.9179274335119212
The head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments.	1.2078593514726914
What many Austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind, and why the campaign did not begin until the Freedom Party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the SPÖ?	1.1873852824671693
There is prejudice at work here, which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle.	1.3699040655243018
I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda, as, for example, the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust.	1.0034724113957172
Shame on you Mr Bertinotti!	0.6140879070167754
You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda.	1.1047163569255813
Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist!	0.8885901831940411
On the contrary, you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did.	1.054732689700905
Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices, you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose.	1.0645812955997802
The attacks against Austria' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people.	1.0049013606231898
That is why we are indebted to the Commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest.	1.3308688271591427
The new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy, the rights of the opposition, commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour....	1.0476424125899098
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
Madam President, to begin with, I would like to make one thing abundantly clear: Austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion.	1.2620089257859104
Austria is a stable democracy; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary.	1.1686562908072295
Austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there.	0.9330105470032111
There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria: there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections, in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found.	1.2414845396893972
There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition.	1.0070701914779987
The Austrian People' s Party, which I represent here in this Parliament, used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union, and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement.	1.3165631948364944
We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria.	1.2883823084597101
Our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present.	1.1531434513045167
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship, many people were perpetrators too, although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt.	1.2361824408683086
The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union.	0.823821464769246
My country' s place is not outside the European Union but in it ...	1.1585541392626286
..., with all the rights and commitments that this entails!	1.3147303144964246
Any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto, and not according to the prejudgements put about both by political adversaries and the international media.	1.1891565052539812
A declared belief in human rights, democracy and the rule of law, in an honest reappraisal of Austria' s role in the past, in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century, the holocaust, will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the ÖVP and FPÖ.	1.1604695803864258
My party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of European politics and continues to be rooted in the European community of values!	1.2906817301979028
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Representatives of the Commission, it is a black day for Austria and for Europe.	1.0799013211072375
Not even Mr Sichrovsky' s web of lies or Mrs Stenzel' s words of appeasement can do anything to change that.	0.9536133158080555
For the day has dawned: two irresponsible politicians, consumed with a lust for power, are selling Austria' s image, political role, and to some extent even its economic interests, down the river!	1.209083874966332
(Applause, heckling)	0.5921299105996624
They are trading this in for a head of government' s position and for membership of a government.	1.1917287498232105
They are just as prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one, as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens.	1.2452139323650713
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate.	1.4251535304581244
However, my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage, is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so, Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their parties, ...	1.4517844134634525
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament.	1.362015433956042
Mr Poettering, it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as I am, albeit for different reasons, for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions.	1.378984265003426
You are having to defend a certain Mr Schüssel, you are having to consort with Schüssel as he is today and who, as I understand it, was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party' s summit meeting.	1.2373883026255794
The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play, i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system.	1.268456230131475
However, in my view, he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this, into our political system, and into the Europe of today, than any other extreme right-wing movement.	1.3794884525618136
Anyone who feeds on prejudice towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives succour to these prejudices, whose programme features parochialism and anti-liberalism, who displays loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relations, and who has never yet distanced themselves clearly and unequivocally from National Socialism, has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate!	1.1241482146129835
(Applause)	-0.0
This historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the Conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured.	0.9343270037701792
That is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the ÖVP - is sustained rather than kept in check.	1.1405076433483332
I understand that Europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government.	1.351989258790651
However, by the same token, there is another Austria, the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FPÖ having any involvement in government, and who will continue to demonstrate against this government.	1.554311320727376
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria!	1.2100453027028828
(Applause)	-0.0
The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the Europe of today, the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism.	1.1521936681642193
For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy, or even against a relapse into barbarism.	1.1622502886824089
Please support the Austrian people against this government!	1.0411458611508293
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, this is an historic moment, as it is now, at last, quite clear to us all that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values.	1.6836530061130344
We see this, now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which, as is known, does not respect all these values.	1.2872513028316412
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified, as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union, meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria' s.	1.520510943568546
As Members of Parliament, we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever.	1.5217265844432186
It is more important than ever that respect for, and non-violation of, human values and the rights of minorities, including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the European Union, form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU, and, for this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding.	1.4398401894395214
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration.	0.777969929523048
As important is the fact that Austria' s forces of democracy should be given support, as none of us wishes to isolate the country.	1.3005555311112142
We know that most Austrians respect these values.	0.9283249503474431
They have also shown how they feel: not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria.	1.1104803049815968
Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time.	1.0951661855070274
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy.	0.7607700479232508
I also appeal to the Austrian President, that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces.	1.3116138510139552
Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group, Francis Wurtz, reminded us of just now.	1.3019746891439603
I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jörg Haider' s party.	1.249226718314753
The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because, as you know, we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit and the Member States' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans.	1.4626205314993226
Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today: this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational, neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary.	1.0128552964129298
This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe.	1.3537806652583015
We are talking about us, not Austria.	1.2447503479988384
We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe.	1.30883295655867
Not only the Alpine region, but all our countries are involved: the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat.	1.3028494224528784
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation.	1.1880938000106471
Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past.	1.1008139563383479
Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak on this, making the value of the presidency' s position even more apparent.	1.5431864140224327
This is the change we must impose on the Commission' s action.	1.3414118860403852
Madam President, despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, which opposes fascism, nazism or communism, both new and old, and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament.	1.4597138324566785
In the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party, there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms or the rule of law, enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties.	1.148474918122455
I would, however, like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office, who has been so critical of Austria, has recently consigned the inhabitants of Macao to the sovereign rule of the People' s Democratic Republic of China.	1.2547451296176446
Perhaps, in order to strengthen the Union' s democracy, it would now be appropriate to isolate Austria and criminalise a party that was democratically elected by the Austrian citizens, while bringing Turkey and its "Grey Wolves" into Europe.	1.3113599787213581
Madam President, we are debating an extremely serious issue.	1.653883525339659
We are debating nothing less than the presence in a Member State' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the Union enshrined in its founding Treaties.	1.2206854985237428
A simple reading of chapter 4, article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder.	1.1638100525761759
The view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others, as is written here, revives old ghosts of the century which we have just left behind, which some historians have described as the century of horrors; horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Haider' s manifesto has stirred up once again, to our amazement.	1.2558549900481581
Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	1.0218058927116669
However, that is not the problem.	1.7208066082921847
The question is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party.	1.1951513945586045
Our answer to this crucial question is no.	0.9004432054959803
Leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations, leaving aside possible exonerations based on other people' s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests, the Spanish delegation of the People' s Group of this Parliament, in full agreement with the Spanish People' s Party and the Spanish Government, clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 January by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council.	1.2014810311891835
We agree with its substance, its tone and its scope.	1.2417665417991834
(Applause)	-0.0
Konrad Adenauer once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the surest way to pacify a tiger was to allow it to devour you.	1.2712738930545338
History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided.	0.7949421535854079
Therefore, Madam President, the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message, rejecting of the tiger of intolerance, xenophobia and totalitarianism, so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications, renunciations and opportunism which mark Europe' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price.	1.1359163002145696
(Loud applause)	0.04062958545577951
Madam President, the European Union was built upon the idea 'never again' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia, concentration camps, anti-Semitism, heightened nationalism or war.	1.1959611004156803
The one and only significance of the European Union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de grâce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe, and which is still highly topical today.	1.2532248293030428
It is not true to say that, when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe, this is merely a question of national sovereignty.	1.3809273662045856
For this Union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances.	1.0935209195951083
It is a Community that is destined to exist, in which, when the main thing is under threat, when values are under threat, all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again.	1.4292875246553651
Let us learn the lessons of the past.	0.7019586352995375
In the thirties, when Adolf Hitler was democratically elected, although with a minority, many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and, Mr Poettering, in France, a number of men and women, on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasions too, thought, 'Better Hitler in France than the Front Populaire.'	1.3737550011190043
They put their own petty squabbles first, and the rest is history.	1.3787765785520765
We must make a rapid, strong and united response.	1.1572201857773174
I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President, Mr Poettering. We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance.	1.3730592774791994
So our response must be rapid and strong.	0.6757953103966233
Of course, the Treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable; I was almost going to say 'irreparable' .	1.2741169899947418
History has taught us that Fascists start to blow hot and cold: using heated words first, in populist, xenophobic speeches, and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to infiltrate them gradually, poisoning them, until the day they start to take action.	1.228938080620679
And when that day comes, it is too late.	1.1885508975860775
So our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late, but we are not at that point: today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point.	1.4919576270975463
We must therefore find a political solution.	1.0785563483197362
I support the Council proposals in this, while deploring a certain lack of strength, a certain spinelessness, on the part of the Commission which will, however, have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis, with determination over time, since Fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy, they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end.	1.4349131573314915
Our response must be rapid.	0.4316066278763775
If today we do not staunchly support the Council, then history will judge us, saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement.	1.28696622113957
Madam President, I am pleased about the fact that, in Austria, the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes, in my eyes, a huge victory for democracy.	1.5445005111711847
Let there be no doubt about it: we decline with thanks a Europe which develops into a kind of "big brother" and which keeps watch over left-wing political correctness in one Member State or another in a Stalinist way and using Stalinist methods.	1.1213951279207584
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party, which was condemned by the court, to the post of European Commissioner.	1.2462029263445114
Today, we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech.	1.398819211762762
Madam President, this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa, who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States.	1.4012505408403977
This debate, and the background to it, reinforced the point that the Council, the Commission and this Parliament itself are dominated by Socialists.	1.5086586915135574
My delegation of 37 Conservative and Unionist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy, programme and tone of Austria' s Freedom Party.	0.9028822460487472
We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history, in particular World War II, but also its policies on enlargement, on immigration, on race and its attitude to the European Union itself.	1.5577700584143888
We were also outraged, however, at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny, the terror and the excesses of the former USSR.	1.3633326600641762
Even today, surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal links with China' s Communist Party.	1.0308208709989386
Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments, or in German state governments, or even the British government' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today.	1.1088768242081266
This, Madam President, is the hypocrisy of the left.	1.4086344123982595
So we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards, especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States.	1.2722647538646423
We should recognise, however, that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results.	1.1735976567648656
This requires action to address the underlying causes, including an examination of the electoral process itself.	1.1206059644304731
That should be our task, not political posturing.	1.2855788672800508
Madam President, Representative of the Council, Commissioner, a week ago, the big international Holocaust Conference ended in Stockholm.	1.4470049272246965
Its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism.	0.999151510190782
It would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite, at this time, into the institutions of the EU, a xenophobic party which flirts with Nazi ideas.	1.5185726439481815
Secondly, I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations.	1.5376266690387108
We demand of the candidate States and of the countries with which the EU cooperates under the Lomé Agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours.	1.3232810597196043
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned.	1.424583441077033
That is why we are reacting against this carry-on in Austria.	1.0443593960823276
It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened.	1.343047509399985
We are at a watershed in the history of the European Union.	0.8955760767987724
The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, something which we take seriously. Something has happened.	1.3407706026435737
The European Union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine.	1.2757973575279193
Madam President, as everyone has said, this is a very important day. It is the day of the first debate of European political life.	1.6085878427681275
And this is not pure chance.	1.3521114515601176
I feel that today' s meeting is not a meeting of Europe, our institutions, with Austria or Mr Haider' s party.	1.4737770693280345
It is the meeting of Europe with itself, with its raison d' être, with the reasons why we are here in this Chamber.	1.6177832339917477
This Chamber was not made for goods, it was not made for money.	1.2002668549038296
This Chamber, and the European institutions, were build to uphold values, morality and a certain spirit.	1.376801740964101
In the twentieth century, we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk, and morality, values and the spirit which I mentioned can be mortally affected by viruses which have just one name: nationalist glorification, populism and the concept of racial superiority.	1.210880366108105
The fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider' s party, the FPÖ, to find nationalist glorification, populism and racial superiority in every chapter.	1.1789389183687402
Reading only one sentence which my friend, Mr Vidal-Quadras, has previously mentioned, "The nation is defined by its location, culture and race, locally, ethnically and culturally."	1.1503650080391394
Well, we cannot accept such statements.	1.4331848863964676
If Europe has any meaning, and - my friends will pardon me telling them - if Christian democracy has any meaning, if the history of Christian democracy has any meaning, then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and, whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again, must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation.	1.2046461004046014
This is the reason why I feel that the European Parliament, which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the Council or the Commission, must pay tribute to those people in the various States and European institutions who had the courage to say no, and it must say, Madam President, that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit, and in clear terms declare, without prevarication, its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in Austria, recalling the statement made on the day of the Munich Agreement by a great French Christian Democrat who said that, if you are going to have to say no, then the best time to do so is right at the beginning.	1.5114762404034394
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as, fortunately, are a great many other Members too.	1.424440012658916
The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too.	1.2679131766810503
Because what is it that unites us in Europe? Surely it is the values and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, more than anything.	1.2415397120478562
The Austrian Freedom Party leader, Mr Haider, has repeatedly repudiated these values.	1.2391350075407912
He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness.	0.6894291009329236
He is a dangerous man.	1.0025935394914225
The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders.	1.1096118530977581
Values should take precedence over power.	0.4949654827546303
We deplore, therefore, what is happening in Austria.	1.0000964835549957
In fact, we were shaken by it.	1.4165551143043067
We are extremely disappointed.	0.7528540116363779
As a last resort, we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternatives.	1.3592145076053792
We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty.	0.6500061492160735
We continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right.	0.80757574893752
If, despite this, the coalition goes ahead, we would urge the ÖVP party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie European integration are observed in political programmes, both in word and deed.	1.4791811756813706
Madam President, Austria awaits a heavy responsibility.	1.3540524236233
Madam President, it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics, but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics.	1.3865282470254299
Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself?	1.2680066123604212
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here?	1.127781782199803
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days?	1.1513550510611783
From all accounts, this would only serve to strengthen Haider.	1.1419621073063877
Who would want this to happen?	0.832988174019766
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics?	1.0073605029886223
Europe is a community of law.	1.1786506639177154
Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold.	1.0745334226459102
One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did.	1.389586872380989
It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did, and in a manner that goes against the Treaty.	1.3342606871327953
It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take!	1.3669671074953011
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, they say, where I come from, 'it' s three times for a Welshman' , and three times, as I think you will discover in the course of that debate, I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent, and on several occasions, a moving debate.	1.534117683861073
First of all, could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday.	1.4374324498828956
I must respond also to the fact, of course, that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity, the complacency and the fragility of the Commission' s opinion.	1.6051431992873237
I am duty- bound to say to this House, there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered, or indeed the action taken, by the Commission on this issue.	1.5324012362826467
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement, as did the President this afternoon, to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday.	1.477252309683206
Secondly, we said, in very specific terms, that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria.	1.5721330744524218
Thirdly, we expressed, in very explicit terms, that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld.	1.5347484192576226
There is no complacency, no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all.	1.2559790020748447
And, when I say that the Commission took that view, I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler, who is from Austria; and who, once again, demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission, under oath, in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning.	1.4106368071046684
Anyone, therefore, who invites Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is Austrian, should examine their own motives in the context of a debate, which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world.	1.188963570325938
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague, Franz Fischler.	1.1204587848070577
Could I also say, Madam President, that the understanding of the presidency, the Portuguese presidency, for our position, was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by Mr Da Costa when he said, and I quote him, that 'Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation' .	1.5436267400024535
That surely is in everyone' s interests.	0.752041451836222
In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine, we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday.	1.5030236294953714
We will continue to do that, Madam President, without fear or favour.	1.3426702941098692
That is our duty.	0.9985480973750598
It is also a matter of conviction.	1.163929886616423
My final point is this.	0.6485164568735864
We understand the context of this essential debate.	1.1343589973659658
There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Haider' s offensive statements, the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies, sometimes on successive days.	1.1531097775478587
We understand that, and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism.	1.3335066075063575
And, when we recall that, like many others on all sides of this House, my and my colleagues' instincts are naturally aroused.	1.5607821457624569
However, the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct.	1.6088708826237328
And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning.	1.2347872300740022
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law. Without fragility, without complacency, without ambiguity, but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people.	1.5655616086444721
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate, 'necessarily with acute vigilance' .	1.153499155155973
I wonder, since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber, whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government.	1.3936975230522388
Does the Commission support the Council?	0.98307480823696
Madam President, when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view, I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning, as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue, it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States.	1.5245984941232607
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	0.9727683663971937
I think that we have just had a great political debate, equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it.	1.5619210337354454
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.	0.8213299124405938
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.	0.6476765615743313
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.4314254166720252
Recourse to the precautionary principle	0.11507974897914652
The next item is the Commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle.	0.8138147679487836
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle, and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen.	1.1979358493338472
The precautionary principle is not a new concept.	1.338842277397208
It has been used by the Community for some time now in a range of policy areas, environmental, human, animal and plant health; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty since Maastricht.	1.2477355033027542
It also appears in a range of international texts, for example, the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol.	0.9541891649587811
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear.	0.8110335586832003
It involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear, but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action.	1.19538321998039
However, the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years.	1.193808576408246
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary.	0.989375351014693
In view of this growing interest, the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle.	1.3807075168784908
The basic aim of the communication is twofold.	1.04734188642864
To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles.	1.174075699981233
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism.	1.1421006197430505
The Commission' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental, human, animal and plant health.	1.299251122237997
Of course, this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures, but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear.	1.305953212295537
As such, while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science, as some have alleged, it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics.	1.4509342211261758
The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society.	1.052505093569497
It is therefore political by nature.	1.1391901703343517
However, the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper.	1.3204491879604212
Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is, we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut.	1.184867861822374
They must be non-discriminatory in their application, that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin.	1.2155583320644994
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken.	0.980456291897785
For example, if one product has been approved, similar products should also be approved.	1.3776127803919238
Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action; that is, the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment, that is the burden of proof.	1.2468301254152885
All these elements have to apply cumulatively.	0.8446386473954826
It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures, which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle. For example, a research programme, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on.	1.429867211293755
Applying the precautionary principle does not, therefore, automatically imply a ban.	0.8748773372685699
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use.	1.4277786572977988
By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle, we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level.	1.2379181474407954
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement.	0.9388409189170609
I have three short questions, the first being as follows.	1.298584960783302
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice.	1.4745749005025666
Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry, Foreign Trade, Competition and the Internal Market?	1.1582603537293898
I am sure that your answer to this will be "yes" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be?	1.4299598222523275
My next question, Mrs Wallström, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example?	1.3799905755457278
Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation?	1.3218769847095706
In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached?	1.184758435888432
. Thank you very much, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, for these questions.	1.1525162689169468
Of course, this is shared by the whole Commission.	1.3511276811274329
This is a common communication which was written by the three of us, David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen and myself, but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today.	1.377092589494046
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission.	1.2059135673398773
So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document.	1.2299938177364937
Yes, I would say we already use this way of working with different, difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example.	1.4055291678055761
And, I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle.	1.4900605518084602
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas.	1.1781450253046817
It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health.	1.5438154120461702
So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it.	1.4082780177996606
Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence.	1.2486521551317435
Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power.	1.1675835697072283
We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for?	1.0920968704140424
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists.	1.2396302385211162
I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority?	1.4290589186510636
How would you describe this?	0.6531820161943473
What establishes a recognised minority?	0.3898469062651935
If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision?	1.250541446710592
The Commission?	-0.0
The Council?	-0.0
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this?	1.3462127424860793
What is the role of the scientific committees?	1.1484047718068109
What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up?	1.4433699938859272
Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way?	1.6355168228549168
These are my three questions.	0.5443193156493961
. Yes, Mr President, that is true.	1.4632910626360496
There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions.	1.1679300664219154
Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers?	1.586590181835238
Well, that depends on who the legislators are.	1.2005765629253948
This is part of risk management.	0.5775602538086344
They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case.	1.455321803593712
However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle.	1.3472569976781672
It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete.	1.0116817630115125
That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science.	1.180086913349884
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base.	1.3402114877739426
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future.	1.3180467251906038
You have to see this as a tool for risk management.	1.4248786696064768
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available.	1.416594549904392
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science.	1.030258070342905
Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not.	1.42139012212688
So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today.	1.2829484033507672
Mr President, I have a question concerning an actual, concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle.	1.3499887985428274
It is about brominated flame retardants.	0.8784470514317518
It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered. There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment.	1.3623676210926123
There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks, while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are.	1.1673264668762517
Recently, both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants.	1.3513928156326755
I am wondering, therefore, if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative.	1.248907891248337
. (SV) Mr President, thank you very much, Mr Sjöstedt, for this question.	1.197946969916711
The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one.	0.7836812459546139
It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done.	1.2962934320282766
We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do.	1.2140931313925025
Allow me to remind you, however, that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban.	1.2376136553759183
There may be a series of different measures which can be taken.	1.0279044176392078
It ought not, therefore, to be immediately interpreted as a ban.	1.245104923064567
Where brominated flame retardants are concerned, there may eventually be a ban, but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken.	1.262932662041218
This issue is extremely topical.	0.8791588161215493
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done.	1.295855731162132
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier.	1.1127236658162896
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean?	1.144677255864485
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops.	1.0703011397126416
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do?	1.2863576251543842
. (SV) Mr President, I am pleased to be able to tell you that, in Montreal, we have just signed a protocol concerning bio-safety.	1.187012021693737
We succeeded there in agreeing, at an international forum, as to the definition of the precautionary principle.	1.420902550501834
I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol.	0.9806035411648196
I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle.	1.031831230443478
We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted.	1.4887330795385763
It is, moreover, also accepted as an important and effective tool.	1.327843750001425
Mr President, I have two questions. I shall try to be very brief indeed.	1.4620412107816474
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle.	0.7638416409455661
As I have understood it, there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood.	1.4695357621639658
Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out, including a cost-benefit analysis?	1.1187587403302734
In that case, I am rather concerned, because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced. Instead, the precautionary principle should come first.	1.4091804443012799
My second question concerns the burden of proof.	0.5066941858278118
I remember Margot Wallström being introduced as Commissioner in the Committee.	0.8540961908668554
At that time, she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof.	0.8783792018560876
In other words, a product' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous.	1.226932318640308
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now.	1.619518146994759
. (SV) Thank you, Mrs Schörling.	1.337808836584585
These are two important questions, and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them.	1.2594743684727878
No, one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals.	1.4007676674113287
When, on the other hand, the decision has been made to take a certain measure, the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness.	1.3284851096434571
It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis.	1.212844754436761
The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof.	0.4781766609446745
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases.	1.186443014508145
I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this.	1.1669820068783074
There, however, we are concerned with that particular area, whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern.	1.4010398616508069
Therefore, the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context. Instead, it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this.	1.3531847929853908
It is, however, perfectly correct that, when it comes, for example, to chemicals, we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof.	1.3681070304186562
Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work, otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible.	1.268253131848859
I will give an example: a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. It is therefore a teratogenic substance.	1.2647370854098217
Very well, it is a fungicide, it kills off mould.	1.4795276042434191
This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory, perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests.	1.343043437066967
Now, in my opinion, given that this is such a serious risk to health, the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market, which New Zealand has done, for example.	1.2974796002214488
So I want to put this question to you. When human health is at stake, or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected, should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis?	1.4575777601176463
The cost of a baby being born blind is too high; there are no benefits that can compensate for this.	1.2166511274377114
In short, Commissioner, I would therefore like to know whether in this case, the precautionary principle as you understand it, would in any case, require the product to be taken off the market, until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary.	1.3130825384496505
. (SV) Mr President, no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people' s health and the environment.	1.2619031008524744
Obviously, I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here, but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case.	1.4326668488912093
The truth, of course, is that a great many Member States, and no doubt other nations too, have taken measures to protect their populations' health which amount to using the precautionary principle, even if it has not always been called that.	1.436218729928983
Naturally, it is not in the first place a question of cost; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided.	1.6144173607821277
Nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure.	1.0407059975900563
I think, however, it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken, it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between.	1.4151440053777726
In those circumstances, consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result.	1.1697522356492893
I cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it, namely when I was on a visit to Africa.	1.0896897255911084
At a hospice for AIDS patients, I met two Irish Catholic nuns who were caring for dying AIDS patients.	0.9873632189921279
They were the first to say that, each day, they must think about doing what is most cost-effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there. We must be very careful about how we use resources.	1.383301814375927
I believe we can learn something from this.	1.1602930307985944
We must, of course, always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help.	1.27483423235625
As is also explained in the present communication, it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis.	1.2321404186613443
Consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge, and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people' s health.	1.3930543335397192
Mr President, it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions!	1.529916166542788
Commissioner, I would like to come back again to my first question, when I asked about the other Commissioners, for it may have sounded as though I was in jest.	1.5628373091520649
Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do.	1.2637371730183438
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked, that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union.	1.2851938328553982
I have good reason for asking this.	0.7172474080364516
As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence.	1.4017036246439774
How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time, for example by our partners in the USA, on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes?	1.3553303428513261
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you?	1.4559441896144478
That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner!	1.294866535156687
Mr President, I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons.	1.3170902614434934
I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts, for example with the United States.	1.3396381719042847
We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise.	1.079785998878934
Ever since we signed this protocol in Montreal, we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment, health and trade.	1.188125480523438
This constitutes a good example, therefore.	1.7486585229370606
We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too, but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily.	1.4922088843764971
We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle, and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it, something which is clearly established in the present communication.	1.160798905195939
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed, so to speak, as more than an ordinary aspect of administration, even though, as we have been able to establish from the interventions, questions and replies, it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance.	1.3214252993608464
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
Intergovernmental Conference	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference [14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)].	0.7781961818927152
Mr President, I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts.	1.5135234968369302
Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration.	0.9584782101878712
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement.	1.2864691385354174
The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century.	1.069475331414435
For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively, more democratically and with complete transparency, clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work.	1.5030113657997817
The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work.	1.2751322738409214
From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit, it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe, one that is more effective, more democratic and more transparent.	1.3015331879328378
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union' s institutional bodies.	1.2251428641464592
I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows.	1.2983428377533217
My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement.	1.4422424182300468
Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union' s institutions.	1.40907332783149
Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public.	1.3860399475350318
In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.073416072090862
At the same time, however, I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform, I repeat, of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health, energy, culture, transport and even tourism.	1.3644940579945717
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end.	1.4433131646915005
All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.0890433365682612
This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union' s Member States.	1.4145296003272476
In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament' s backing.	1.3905575048177339
The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us.	1.5059574574270045
Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki.	1.2440029118654654
It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union' s institutions.	1.4200139405976198
In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary.	1.4760253236714378
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States.	0.853788174979826
It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform.	1.0172471510511398
We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union.	1.6305504158870563
Having said this, Mr President, this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference.	1.3749120493851728
In theory, we could have done so.	1.1691730337105575
We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th.	1.1856257219584763
However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement.	1.4194609818105575
Mr President, I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly.	1.26590743357236
The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues.	1.1176323492720537
Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself.	1.3583025763924852
However, the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference. This is for one very simple reason: according to the agreements made in Helsinki, this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues, which are currently decided unanimously, being decided by a qualified majority.	1.4912618980361034
Therefore, the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase.	1.0848935619177966
It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament.	1.0276603683284864
Therefore, since the qualified majority will be extended, there will also be more codecision with Parliament.	1.3602370583036651
However, this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union.	1.2556870914065654
That it is what we are doing.	1.050953928017367
We believe that, in the political design of the Union, other issues need to be dealt with.	1.3294435112885916
These include, amongst others, the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues, which have made much progress recently, but which must be incorporated into the Treaty.	1.6492243531914896
Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and work began on its wording yesterday, which I believe has started very positively.	1.3717295790106618
We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union' s institutions.	1.2123571770436943
Therefore, Mr President, our proposals, which we will specify in another report, together with the proposals of the Commission, which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents.	1.5923148360811166
We will talk about this on another day.	0.806863930215617
Today we must give the green light to this conference, and, for its part, the Group of the European People' s Party, Mr President, is ready to give that green light.	1.2101982397995876
Mr President, for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee.	1.7256453344297302
We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened.	1.23773731455664
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term, because they are very important subjects in themselves.	1.3861799992076747
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC.	1.0409579930808674
These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC.	1.094345295148388
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study.	1.0851787770064418
They need a political deal.	0.7973561365070597
It is more a question of nine minutes, perhaps nine hours if it is difficult, locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects, not nine months.	1.2136939247537133
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda.	1.0493710364018716
There are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at, especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new countries.	1.3609954745766055
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree.	0.6392128868062994
Nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated.	0.8658155731461442
However, there are six, seven, eight, nine perhaps, subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address.	1.3762658958738014
There is time.	0.3416840634477862
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act.	0.9863272306067558
It lasted only five months.	0.49993044181052965
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year.	0.7306438539034126
Only the Amsterdam Treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the British election if you were going to have any outcome from that IGC so that was a different reason.	1.2550294213738664
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda.	1.138837529141862
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view.	1.1625255019478613
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles.	1.3805225263284944
I thank the Commission for doing that even if, of course, I do not agree with everything the Commission said.	1.3148225320229756
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward.	1.0636380943454842
Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that.	1.1712396313499023
They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC.	1.2409003495546478
That is all to the good.	1.0684362233837577
The Parliament, the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda.	1.6583220216037413
I wish you every success, President of the Council, in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Valentine' s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion, also when the French Presidency takes over, by the end of this year.	1.3986766554699235
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted.	1.024709614685948
That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner.	1.1609443241225021
It makes it impossible for those same Member States, at the IGC, to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights.	1.2908739269171168
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States, especially Britain and France, seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty.	1.136167118934347
It is vital that the IGC prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty.	1.193797283560379
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court.	1.4294217503295028
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention.	1.506244983032009
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy.	1.1563149453906907
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent.	0.9674078630117668
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believes that the European Parliament' s decision to rush headlong into giving its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference undermines the political significance of the request for talks with the Council, and in the end, makes it rather irrelevant.	1.2074867135891183
We would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion, and frankly, we did not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by scheduling the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine' s day, the first day of the Strasbourg part-session.	1.2991856092141416
Moreover, given that this opinion is quite important, we can still vote for it, and indeed, the majority of our group will be voting for it.	1.765763371415679
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform.	1.347713403657761
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States.	1.2210959842811018
It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that, in any case, the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act, and to prevent and rectify the course of events.	1.4949039868296865
We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference, and I firmly hope that this opinion, that was given reluctantly, will not mean that the European Parliament ceases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise, but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament.	1.5896288856695735
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, to my mind, it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful.	1.2684893265625758
After all, we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance, that is to say, we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future.	1.2783320450114863
How, though, is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now, i.e. before enlargement takes place?	1.3601796187025708
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.3211284099745377
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future.	1.0469993999114384
My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs.	1.0136807170939484
You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand.	0.9518923813400056
What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and, in particular, a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs, because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns, the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians.	1.3665263980782643
The politics of closed doors and private discussions; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all.	0.9120744786795116
That is why we need transparency.	1.1500316290384407
I believe it falls to you, as President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before, leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties.	1.1144418640655753
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going, and its outcome, rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent.	1.4525286569675249
We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future.	1.3078391800681408
In this way, Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy.	1.162165640671686
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to.	1.1841510219268383
As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I wish to make the following point clear: neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter.	1.1813699425093926
After all, what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals?	1.1651336837479334
No, to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union.	1.0816755762403143
The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone.	0.9859974785139173
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union.	1.1052025545981476
Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year.	1.331488286055104
Of course, we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States.	1.2634775251687378
We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform, as the Council has resolved to do, and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny.	1.4867028899428316
We need bold change and, at the same time, we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States.	1.1857461586856586
This is something I would stress, particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States.	1.5485945433495372
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament, on all the issues you have raised.	1.3403102988024953
There is one final issue I would like to raise.	1.2519904146158403
Parliament' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy.	1.2633235585725895
It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies, but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes.	1.324468749512648
What we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union' s policies to date.	1.3367332959316445
It is all about creating a socially just Europe.	0.8930852294448695
A socially just Europe is still highly topical, for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union' s policies.	1.3147585396613422
Hence, to my mind, that includes having the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty, which defines the Union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition. The same applies to Article 105, in my view, for the European Central Bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the Treaty, of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment.	1.4391013488595275
Mr President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, as set by the Helsinki Council, i.e. focussing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe, must be adhered to.	1.2858268567911326
It must be adhered to in the interests of the fast, effective work of the conference, prior to enlargement.	1.2689624179732089
This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission, which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and, what is more, widen it in the wrong direction, i.e. moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system.	1.3337171843580766
Our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which, when taken together, form a real alternative resolution.	1.1660649120951303
In them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty.	1.3010066990115599
We deplore the fact that the Commission, in its opinion of 26 January, limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised Europe enlarging towards the East, a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions.	1.2877434685421199
The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint, but this is a totally superficial concept.	1.2863828234496824
Quite the opposite, in an enlarged Europe, Mr President, the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding.	1.2603854321352734
Furthermore, the centralised European system, as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation, erodes nations and, in eroding nations, erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves.	1.4638346559782767
The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker, as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending.	1.3431582932380592
This is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of Europe was clearly recognised, i.e. by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty.	1.2703002229036837
We are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles, one which are still, unfortunately, outside the European Parliament and the Commission.	1.3087888411272788
A flexible Europe, is a Europe which respects its national democracies, which relies on the support of its nations, its national patriotisms, instead of continually persecuting them.	1.3937869399549137
It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats, not the constraining, convoluted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2152669732424812
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament' s opinion is.	1.4963316511455051
It is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further European integration. I say this without being the slightest bit ironical about the highly respectable position of Mr Berthu and his group, but it is no coincidence that the European Council' s decision is supported by those who are, after all, in Parliament because - and this is a highly respectable position - they are fighting against further integration.	1.463683910630504
This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council.	1.4233155356147975
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compliments to those already offered - can convey Parliament' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine' s day. In any case, tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda.	1.3546794698635047
This message must be very clear; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow.	1.4101566345283658
We shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the IGC on 14 February, but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content.	1.3612977347388573
Just consider the facts: we looked at Austria a while ago, but we can also look at the stock markets, Mr President: given that the euro, that great undertaking, has fallen 16% against the dollar in a year, then perhaps, I will not say a government, but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues.	1.4911020538551556
There is clearly a more ambitious goal.	0.9273392633754489
We Radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the House in order to consolidate this text, and for example, to request - just for the sake of mentioning Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done, i.e., that the European Parliament should also be involved in drawing up the European Constitution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty.	1.5886447438987767
We know that there are other topics: for example, many Members have subscribed, along with us, to the issue of the seat of the institutions, an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level.	1.3904163713815922
In conclusion, I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once, so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, this agenda will be revised.	1.3655173991337692
Otherwise, the challenge really would be lost, not just for the present but also for many years to come.	1.3843844361638649
Mr President, the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2067813464733845
He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but, in the Commission' s draft, plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision-making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market. This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels, even if a unanimous French National Assembly, a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this.	1.387304134040722
And, in this regard, you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people' s social conditions, which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the polls.	1.3790354725518834
These are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day.	1.1701578827671766
Brussels knows best.	0.3465663133967961
Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency, but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step, and that is not only my assessment, but also that of the European Ombudsman.	1.493386732246728
Today, the Commission is obliged, on a case-by-case basis, to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people' s demands for, and expectation of, transparency and, if the Commission' s regulation is adopted, the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration.	1.412570142546262
There is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States.	1.085375203894758
Under the banner of "progress towards transparency" , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public.	1.0164914231259026
It is, of course, thoroughly Orwellian.	0.8666526689477788
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not, at the same time, available for critical scrutiny by the public.	1.3199941609184158
Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism, for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission' s possession. There follows, however, a long, long list of exceptions, and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions.	1.3837818065841399
The French text contains the word "refuse" and the English text the word "shall" , which means that the Commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public, for example in my own country.	1.4000334360175242
In addition, we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions, which may be used for any purposes whatsoever. It is therefore ...	1.5491179229084642
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Council Presidency' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness.	1.1147304632220416
We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve.	1.2199873715252745
The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track, although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament' s motions are anything to go by.	1.321809984146716
There is more to be said on that score.	1.2282680394435035
It is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick; that of the power to act, democratic legitimacy and transparency.	1.0949860780187808
In the end, it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens.	1.2571454044732182
At the same time of course, we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union.	1.4454066180391913
If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is.	1.3092775771665741
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade.	1.4067845980579565
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union' s being able to function come what may.	1.231911904857922
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned, and legislation and in relation to treaties, which entail changes being made to legislation.	1.4016403883074258
Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament' s corresponding powers in this area.	1.184888156303162
In addition, we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union, for there is a lack of supervision in this area.	1.570473524235397
The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting, when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council, which is an unacceptable way to go on.	1.4812451954377333
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank.	1.26945268152911
However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side.	1.48161754559856
Furthermore, the tripartite relationship of Commission, Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy, where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures, for which the Commission alone has responsibility.	1.3351977452505261
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this.	0.8588872751075538
We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.9997001931358227
The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate.	1.2367798854116103
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to.	0.9497979363966904
The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country' s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor.	1.5706978515715215
I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights.	1.4466714933984315
The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences.	1.7186110429262673
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice.	1.049699663220785
For this reason, we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty.	1.3112628025525266
In my view, that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on.	1.2527337964437428
If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union.	1.1084676799350455
This is the crux of the matter.	0.7726729724201338
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage.	0.9807038939219408
, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. (IT) Mr President-in-Office, on listening to the various interventions, you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament' s political groups, the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency, instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.3266374773298706
I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this, last week in the Committee I chair, but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager.	1.5702783352056002
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries, and therefore in their parliaments.	1.2720545595148987
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments, which were represented by competent and exacting delegations.	1.3418073176616325
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging.	1.6174372410259974
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table.	1.1665688892728812
However, we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2430259735079647
Yesterday, we also discussed the Commission, represented by Commissioner Barnier, who gave its opinion.	1.500290178678918
This effort was appreciated, even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals, and moreover, Mr President-in-Office, you also expressed different views.	1.300246285044899
Nevertheless, we must stress that many people are aware, as they were yesterday too, of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe, a risk that was, moreover, indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one' s attention, owing to the authority of the person being interviewed - Jacques Delors.	1.3659239336572087
We must, therefore, ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the Union and how to strengthen - and this has been discussed in the House even today, with regard to the situation in Austria - the system of principles, values and rights underpinning the Union and the role of the political institutions of the Union, with regard, among other things, to running the economy.	1.4916227244781224
We are counting on the Portuguese Presidency, we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.3124987504354193
Mr President, only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement.	1.340447926474585
Only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction.	0.7055878976069161
That is why sweeping reforms are necessary and, hence, a widened IGC agenda.	1.4421566124866616
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, turned a deaf ear to this Parliament.	1.0032383869164136
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor' s book.	0.803902319584343
It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join forces for this IGC.	1.1961598526834651
In many ways, they share the same interests and the same insights.	1.3348125623008458
An essential component of this joint effort should, in any case, be this Parliament' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty.	1.2625787201185423
Of all priorities, this one is the most pressing.	1.5080753058885026
What is the Commission' s verdict on this?	1.1186183148490243
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and, therefore, not only within the working party, but also at the same political level as the Commission.	1.5470912203029374
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission.	1.0840841477342893
Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States, but we owe them to ourselves.	1.31175604498839
If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement, we will drown in our own political quagmire.	1.4046420666297184
Mr President, there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation.	1.5331224286811131
After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC.	1.4576237715553932
The fact is, whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way, you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion, Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it, i.e. demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion.	1.37591798413665
Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow, 3 February, as a matter of urgency, when we could wait, in a position of strength, until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February, and thus force an agenda that is complete, and therefore consistent, on the Council.	1.5315093123441756
A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today.	0.802495000761179
Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly, in our resolution, that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues, since in our haste, with blameworthy naivety, we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda.	1.5593475010799391
If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC, then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this.	1.4881813838259212
Whether we want it or not, since Parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates, the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union.	1.1037095223293394
I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority, those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam leftovers, to take up their pilgrims' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended, since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council.	1.2709969625387687
Because of the situation in Austria, this is a dark day for Europe.	1.2350595316092923
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive, and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing.	1.3366906793591669
In order to assert our fundamental values, they need to be laid down in writing, as a matter of urgency, and, beyond this IGC, I believe we owe Europe a constitution.	1.379826981601818
Mr President, the draft resolution we are now discussing requires, precisely as before, that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions.	1.543426443608972
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this.	1.1754446857018142
I am convinced that this is an error of judgement.	1.3324909586822247
A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement.	1.0915478485988837
A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries.	0.9369703808423727
Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level.	1.0086372694455783
It is not, however, possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union.	1.3397667153088957
This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank. This is untenable.	1.3869595295648114
If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic, the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered.	1.3720747466987997
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity. Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible.	1.301008226764229
The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective.	1.0447822442740302
Article 56 of the Treaty, prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital, must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control.	1.0613768468859
In the majority of EU countries, there are now governments dominated by social democrats.	1.146745016181482
It is remarkable that, now they have the opportunity to do so, none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union.	1.2922018522329448
It also, of course, damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital.	0.9657243671142298
The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2622202530534388
It is, however, important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States.	1.2957192415776981
It is the Member States' parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty.	1.5861207277515135
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification.	1.3237758697985638
Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text, which I shall vote for, even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it.	1.4809573283869937
Nevertheless, the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right.	1.409119293575434
The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world.	1.4142872516596892
This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution.	1.3465082242513116
The amendment of the Treaties was, however, limited to a review of some internal rules, which was necessary and important, but did not answer the fundamental question: what is Europe, what are its common principles and therefore, its objectives and limitations?	1.6347099419777857
However, politics exacts its revenge, and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda, it comes back in, as a matter of fact, through a door, and through the front door in the case of Austria, since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intolerance, xenophobia and forms of racism.	1.423427020848799
And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this.	1.3089082751502525
I belong to a world, the world of Liberal Catholics, which is not left-wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values, and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values.	1.4100734998792552
The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in a European Constitution, then we shall construct a Europe without a solid, lasting base.	1.5436029948112253
Commissioner Barnier, I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values: make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles, because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe.	1.4423128682702422
Mr President, I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which, looked long and hard at, threatens the whole of democratic Europe.	1.1290624936298848
I am thinking of the contributions from Mr Bonde and Mr Sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist EU.	1.1245713521967775
They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles.	0.9685922341931807
I might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country, Denmark, takes it for granted that, when we enlarge the circle of EU countries to include the envisaged huge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the breadth of the Union, we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth, that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a United States of Europe.	1.3620467285164184
However, that is precisely what is happening.	1.6514361168771436
With every single geographical extension to the area covered by the EU, we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth, and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee is contemplating, especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth.	1.336977408730992
In the light of developments in recent days, it might well be asked what we really are to do about these intergovernmental conferences and treaty amendments when government leaders - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decisions in relation to an independent Member State entailing intervention in that Member State' s democratic process.	1.4145421952713944
You can think what you like about Mr Haider, and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician, but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country' s democratic process.	1.3484964993561017
When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen.	1.5141561904243739
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon.	0.9614735540480116
On 14 February, we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000.	1.2987949755791561
This is a big task but it can be done.	1.394756738784509
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement.	1.1439598256582448
In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important "Amsterdam leftovers" .	1.204328358726735
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe.	1.3474372788580635
In relation to the latter point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining.	1.222238798107535
We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission.	1.042104577854863
I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point.	0.9130657391734573
At the IGC, we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution.	1.4903087921023508
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty.	1.3484247731383974
In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions.	1.406805349984624
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully.	0.7908405121553852
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents.	0.9403009662342371
The Treaty of Amsterdam, Mr President, has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe.	1.3570956435438133
Mr President, I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution, which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible.	1.3394790543313468
In any case, this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon.	0.9990398083226547
I think that, under the present rules of the Treaties, the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation.	1.4737626154985695
On the contrary, we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms, in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposals are worthy of note.	1.3001362596885808
We must use dialogue at every political level, including of course dialogue with the national parliaments.	1.244021658976957
That way, we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms.	1.387833108829962
Parliament' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that, with the Union' s institutional changes, we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union.	1.45277398483483
They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone.	0.89642091517992
The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive.	0.9362859744358485
It may be easy to come up with solutions, but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term.	1.1278913501465413
I will mention two point that may create tension.	0.8960574960197303
One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries.	0.9988752781560135
Europe is not, nor can it become a classic federal state.	1.1308659421239071
The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union, which is a union of states and peoples.	1.1473798311700683
The other area of conflict is more difficult.	0.779969939727489
Owing to the imminent increase in membership, the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective.	1.435606149236401
This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly.	1.0778248568751085
By its very nature, however, the European Union is, and will remain, a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution.	1.3882626782447611
Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist.	0.630842461747331
Of course they do, but they are not unlimited.	1.3044696379325635
If the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness, then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer.	1.312485599557895
I am, however, optimistic.	1.2194104828043595
Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened.	1.1523072463009476
The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union.	1.2498686381818804
It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union, which will, however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned.	1.4030638080948825
The Commission' s former president, Jacques Delors, has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation.	1.4618707757232887
He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions, for the sake of clarity.	1.3902565924196586
The Commission' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines.	1.5250038974405897
Last November, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe: the onion skin model.	1.106976098221454
In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility.	1.44218211963227
Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party.	1.177748843489587
My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand.	1.1950612204086126
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions.	1.295042162595231
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about.	1.2579451796929346
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament.	1.0690137421427948
A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly.	0.9049780377888523
If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality, six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants, you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales, which is a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom.	1.2325472752668465
Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in this House at the moment; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen.	1.6311754825000422
Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700, bring in 26% more population over time, and then adopt the Commission' s, I think ill-considered, proposition, that there should be a European list of candidates.	1.341579403349939
What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here?	1.2630784616587747
It will become totally invisible!	0.7042559856098999
Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones.	1.2875153921280769
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view.	0.8043585605787733
Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times.	1.7040296881087886
This time, however, it is true.	1.3147962952896644
We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement.	1.653654670812756
The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not.	1.2980029111169855
Will we enlarge with or without deep reform?	0.6275086447899537
That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method.	1.5252957472905904
It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place.	1.4343649139838197
That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand.	1.3083597059460172
The Council must realise that, if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further.	1.5211458598345
The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion.	1.21743179293783
We want an Intergovernmental Conference, but not this one.	1.3501414865724988
Must there be an IGC?	0.6791059371677179
Of course there must, but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2622784290705404
The agenda must go much further. We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic.	1.4064249688335169
Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes, more - its ability to take the initiative.	1.4714563033589527
We must clearly set firm objectives.	0.7064407338213823
The functionalist approach is over, for better or for worse.	1.185932531519754
The functionalist approach has brought us to this point.	0.6939566665672442
Have we achieved results?	0.49028025598046127
Yes, but the point is to make a qualitative leap and, speaking in political terms, this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment.	1.3434471752239108
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi.	1.3370368645315567
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency.	1.3787337159066881
As far as we are concerned, after producing the opinion expected from the Commission, according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated.	1.3129936498525747
We know, I know myself, that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us.	1.4882065779137468
I would just like to make a few comments, after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups.	1.413007275116111
Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda.	1.3693642245488507
I understand this anxiety, this fear that the agenda may be too limited, and yet I feel, as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki, that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate.	1.6422245710659644
Indeed, it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate, which the Commission framed for its own opinion, but using all the terms thereof, plus everything between the lines.	1.4824838737479642
We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label.	1.3391141637210258
I do not like the term 'leftovers' any more than Richard Corbett does.	1.1345488023494854
It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects, and difficult, so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth.	1.2838997410351063
As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects, even though I do consider them as priorities, and consider that they must be dealt with now.	1.4157038566299887
They are the first but they are not the only subjects, Mr Seguro, that the conference must deal with.	1.630414011435416
We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference, if the Portuguese Presidency firstly, and then the French Presidency, so wish, in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement.	1.550575786991001
We are ready for it, whether it is a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which work has started, the CFSP and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations, or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work: reorganisation of the Treaties.	1.405509298870291
I have heard many comments on the Commission' s opinion, which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth, with specific indications of new draft articles, but no one has said that we were going beyond the Helsinki mandate.	1.5475439063193097
This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate, by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers.	1.1918478333471798
As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceedings, I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me, on the basis of our shared experience, in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok, are going to be working.	1.3968099262787232
Of course, the final trade-offs will be made, as in any institutional negotiations, and I think this is no bad thing, at Council level, especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government, who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands.	1.5638282915146426
Let me point out, in passing, that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is also a Council member, and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role, alongside the Heads of State and Government, particularly during the final period.	1.4118761299368423
However, these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared.	1.3911883533195755
This preparatory work, this fine-tuning, must not be omitted, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful, and that it will not just be limited to technical details.	1.5757823713486108
I think that all of us, the personal representatives of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, your two representatives, and myself, as a representative of the Commission, will be going into matters in detail, but it will be afterwards, at a different level, one in which we will also be participating, that the last trade-offs must be made.	1.6336035974194631
Throughout this conference, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important, but the quality of what they will be saying.	1.404481620239221
And once again I should like to point out in this House, in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament, prior to Amsterdam, the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations.	1.415780297225628
I am sure that the situation will be just the same and, as far as I am concerned, in my current position, I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations.	1.5097967824830227
I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be.	1.7698441720145501
We now await, therefore, with great interest, ladies and gentlemen of the House, your next opinion, in which you will specify Parliament' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations.	1.4749247653444328
It is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negotiations, the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other, alongside the Council members, explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continually, every day, what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as European institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest.	1.410770162141565
In the coming months, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation, on good terms, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok, in order to reconcile our points of view, if need be.	1.3310120670461605
Quite probably, our points of view and our positions will not always be the same. There will probably be differences of opinion, that would be only normal.	1.5408971440666832
The important thing is that we are consistent, and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner.	1.3583810726341186
Our concern and our ambition, therefore, on a large number of subjects, is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully.	1.323883494399756
This will not be a matter of chance, since, let me repeat, I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union.	1.3926523777410649
Finally, I should like to make three additional comments, quite briefly, Mr President.	1.369458500696136
Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate.	1.5475347406242743
Such dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important.	1.330549755593919
I have said, furthermore, that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments.	1.2554536806341623
Tomorrow, I shall be in London.	1.2878969807906389
In a fortnight' s time, I shall be in Berlin.	1.3067380472865406
In three weeks' time, I shall be in Paris, and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another.	1.4383144425692806
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive, and I should like to thank you for taking it.	1.353914999973764
My second brief comment is to thank the Portuguese Presidency, particularly Mr Seixas da Costa, for his proactive approach.	1.4175345389315248
Indeed, the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own: the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency.	1.2557496394734164
It will have to initiate these negotiations.	0.8112391153602434
We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency, in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000.	1.2742701197475244
Not only that a conclusion can be reached, but that a successful conclusion can be reached, which is not necessarily the same thing.	1.2834424507726934
Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully.	1.2400841789853478
The handover will have been made, but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made, by yourself, Mr President, and by the Portuguese Presidency, are going to be extremely important, as is the nature of this handover.	1.5881845500189975
It is all the work which is going to be carried out together, under your guidance particularly, in the course of these few months, which is extremely important.	1.448599304800559
We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion, and indeed great expectations thereof. Portugal is a small country, but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions.	1.4209786083095757
After having heard Prime Minister Guterres, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself, I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations.	1.3700606488217297
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months.	1.1608052536620632
Finally, let me repeat, we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations.	1.3856091910680322
These are difficult subjects, subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain.	1.0067345457683357
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament, Ministers, Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens, to public debate.	1.2683658837557115
As far as the Commission is concerned, it will, ladies and gentlemen, be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate.	1.4036985378182492
Cross-border services	0.28247065951097705
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	0.5807876034932212
A5-0007/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services (COM(1999)3 - C4-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD));	0.7951882987021385
A5-0012/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a Council directive extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to third-country nationals established in the Community (COM(1999)3 - C4-0096/1999 - 1999/0013(CNS)).	0.8450628556021005
- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today, but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do.	1.117487293884358
I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative, and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today.	1.3996922240298941
It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis.	1.3261759057484057
The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees, I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst.	1.4650828284059945
These have, in fact, clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits.	1.2766670186703
However, the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue.	1.3646489633931456
Furthermore, not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice' s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement, and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services; barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for the smaller companies.	1.389018602452688
The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services.	1.1084566482532898
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here.	1.3562440150103583
Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises.	0.9552597912979912
It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement.	1.1562180865652003
All provisions, i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights, should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services.	1.2518761065497632
I, together with the European Parliament' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view, as expressed in the report produced by the Council' s Legal Service, is inappropriate.	1.4337990907446612
Consequently, I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned.	1.3676926698205953
I also believe that Parliament' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission' s proposal.	1.2479935751842754
Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the Council, and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense.	1.2029463338510205
When it comes to acceptance by the Council, I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible, even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals.	1.5124406525629115
I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis.	1.3147686596520913
Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments, one of the essential differences is that, in place of a "service provision card plus notification for each individual contract" system, provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract.	1.2294888377146722
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms.	0.8758838245052972
However, in order to compensate for this, all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued, and as the Commission' s proposal would have it, more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued.	1.3405742728724483
An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection, not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter.	1.4670063257546007
This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident.	1.0932532208443286
Likewise, the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued, namely under the terms of an opposition procedure.	1.2735114641605927
What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States, rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States.	1.4039344121738604
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs.	1.0537616301488353
I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months, and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting.	1.3372130498932358
However, we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months.	1.3039873911126645
When it comes to self-employed persons, in addition to the amendments already described, we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent, and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment.	1.4359031578997932
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	1.085660006217154
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee' s amendments, which they adopted unanimously.	1.317144342057036
I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions.	1.0109252386283263
I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament' s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted; whether or not one should use the number or date alone, or both, and how extensively to quote from them.	1.3047971359556463
Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report.	0.9273353277533409
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons.	1.2848791286032601
I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology, i.e. the correct way to quote.	1.2050933675707656
This would make our rapporteur' s life considerably easier in the future.	1.0760532047812743
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio' s reports.	1.0664426962599323
Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously, and I would like to stand by this outcome, which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions.	1.2527101817494477
On a final note, I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in compiling these reports, which were far from easy to produce.	1.2914411361949942
I would like to single Mr Wieland out for special mention, for he has the dubious honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is customary in the drawing up of this report, contributing excellent and constructive ideas; and this without being in a position to receive the plaudits awarded a rapporteur.	1.2676145827455878
That is why he deserves special mention!	1.2269430414932854
.	-0.0
(NL) Mr President, I am pleased I have been given the opportunity to make a few introductory remarks at the end of rapporteur Mrs Berger' s speech, after which I will, of course, listen with all due attention to the next speakers. If you allow me, Mr President, I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate.	1.3612891240448373
May I say how the Commission welcomes the European Parliament' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third-country employees, the topic of the debate.	1.291879698831961
I am extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge.	1.2681682628306734
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	0.8521199000663369
The Commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards.	1.0971375082868795
If the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more, or all, Member States, the procedure would be more flexible still.	1.4363508019779216
The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card.	0.9183357955265036
However, I do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a Member State.	1.1774136252011094
The Commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice.	1.0323585836232356
An efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market.	1.0367426010928225
It seems over the top to us for other Member States to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards.	1.2474666045613179
Indeed, it should be possible for a third-country subject who has legal status in a Member State to be admitted to other Member States too.	1.3044970069338864
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification.	1.1171856791176062
Neither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three months after the card has expired.	1.039649949222906
Following completion of the service, it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided.	1.3317264516572875
That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio' s Amendment No 22 in both respects.	1.2650839282823696
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the Commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal.	1.2611720601562955
These are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments.	0.8469390467157943
I hope that, at the end of the debate, when all the speakers have contributed, I will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments.	1.4590645033108682
Mr President, tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as well as the amended version.	1.21775904770735
I propose to confine my comments to two areas.	0.8564442498184581
Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve, that is achieve in the real sense.	1.367884341057627
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account.	1.6416704954480514
My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment.	0.9053917193318541
Then there are the interests of the Member States, which, being on the receiving end, may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario.	1.3294847970679322
If we are going to abide by the one extreme, that is the interests of the Member States, then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high.	1.3286989774140965
There is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card.	1.2113481143853715
If I were to go to the other extreme, as few hurdles as possible that is, then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive.	1.3563347112447877
I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place, but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high, in reality no one would apply for the card. Alternatively, I might have no directive at all.	1.5203110768749393
Neither outcome would be satisfactory.	0.5868940929457312
Perhaps this is also why, as is rumoured to be the case, the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well.	1.5648331213513134
We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other, that of finding the easiest possible solution.	1.6051874300450595
We want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis-à-vis the business world, but once these have been overcome, implementation is as easy as it possibly could be.	1.1313870578766276
Therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States.	0.8736943839818507
If a company in France says that it has an employee who has to work in Denmark on a permanent basis, and only in Denmark, then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark.	1.448943766382332
Accordingly, the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance.	1.2215755323761963
In return for this, however, we want early notification obligations to be discontinued, rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them, and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his/her posting.	1.414824115694415
Consequently, I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	1.0793973377677772
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission.	0.9065458654676335
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution.	1.1578863287082306
If a particular Member State was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country, then this particular Member State would be able to revoke this card, as it were, for the reasons cited in this directive, which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution.	1.2585119909213767
Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter.	0.9640758883232804
Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers.	1.116637938445604
We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty, some of them very old, which are still referred to as EC.	1.3974498015829773
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law.	1.1166571903035607
However, before the elections we - the Council, the Commission, Parliament, the press, unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens.	1.5338701510808201
We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU.	0.9483507199381427
They have now got to grips with "EU" .	0.9855530950197622
We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver "EC service provision card" and not "EU service provision card" .	1.1756012165143437
It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in, this is the one that counts in their eyes.	1.6798575221653547
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction.	1.125397973938108
Mr President it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so I shall be very brief indeed.	1.1826028530443504
One of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism.	1.088031649203898
This directive is, of course, not in itself directly about that.	1.3623439113602214
It is about attending to the needs of the internal market, creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed.	1.0664558926383751
That is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger.	1.0257993862696186
We welcome that, and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision, we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law.	1.4433611922824128
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally, which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive, which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council.	1.3107605021583233
Nevertheless, I have tabled an amendment.	1.1613470340573702
Mrs Berger, in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6, you mention legal security.	1.4344508867649426
The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit, since all that does is create legal insecurity.	1.0989089702104269
You rightly raise the concern, also expressed by Mr Wieland, at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire, but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit.	1.2694190224841961
If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date, it must end on that date.	1.2379722936523487
Legal security requires this.	0.44009416268815527
On the other hand, with regard to point d of Amendment No 10, which refers to the first directive, you suggest that, for reasons of public security or public order regulations, a Member State may reject the validity of the card.	1.386677693131198
There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive.	0.9886031337240553
It makes no sense for any worker within the Schengen area, since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State, and the second Member State would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory.	1.1922290725167544
It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity.	0.9820440747267021
In the case of a non-Schengen state, in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22, that possibility is contemplated, and is perfectly expressed, and I believe this provides greater legal security.	1.4837248878763247
The discretional power of the State, which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10, seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report.	1.1434794526703411
I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully, and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result.	1.3551328914091443
On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks.	1.1659262575493252
However, in the case of the United Kingdom, we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable.	1.6252924325959675
Partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom.	1.3703422082227967
Under the arrangements contained in the Treaties, the United Kingdom retains its border controls.	1.1696520060438722
Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation, third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described, will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State, thereby by-passing UK border controls.	1.1106853917827786
If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements, that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process.	1.5321077778703778
For that reason, we shall vote against both these proposals.	1.1350418666303508
Mr President, Commissioner, first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner.	1.2293750632309663
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services.	1.1530377367680085
The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises.	1.1832420769066487
The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr Wieland on this - are essential, for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts.	1.3294992170743936
Why do I think we need the directive so much?	1.3833378976411095
Three reasons and they are as follows: on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU, in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market.	1.2492758940496314
Therefore, whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions, I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible.	1.6642028441828918
My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission. Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations?	1.2488960676006482
How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view, as this will have important implications, notably for the accession negotiations and for our country, which shares common borders with so many applicant countries?	1.3798063438644492
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, did not apply to them.	1.2651186621083175
Indeed, they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided.	1.3383127878181265
There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory.	0.8029160383931635
I assume that, although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known, their number will most definitely not be low.	1.2855913999668365
So, up to now, their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation.	1.3700130174470262
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card.	1.3396390379874294
It seems important, in this respect, to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner, namely within five days of a simple declaration' s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided; and that, also to prevent misuse, this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended.	1.432619725673876
I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner.	1.20016105212909
Having also studied the amendments submitted, I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow.	1.4022078945302858
May I, to finish off, thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having, in that way, added an important degree of meaning to her report?	1.3454782483070808
I think that, with this report, we are, once again, one step closer to the realisation of the internal market.	1.342865484450469
Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail.	1.0780138746293724
In the course of my speech, I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regarding the remark he has just made.	1.2558765740943583
Regarding the first proposal on third-country employees, the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 22.	1.0267445704832512
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too, provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established.	1.2654173490935112
The Commission also agrees with Amendment No 11, except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months, as I explained just now.	1.1911891702822028
We also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as, as a result of this, the card' s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States.	1.169382808389746
In terms of comitology, Amendments Nos 14 and 21 also apply in part, insofar as the rights of Parliament are concerned.	1.0561247085915364
I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three-month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned.	1.299397269598302
In this respect, the Commission supports Amendment No 22, as I have already mentioned.	1.423722178749614
The other amendments are unacceptable.	0.8638685226173225
Personally, I am rather in favour of the term "EU service provision card" which is proposed in Amendment No 1, but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this.	1.5391488490721592
As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96/71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force, no change is necessary.	1.1818637413445963
Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued.	1.1193104081348018
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States.	0.9309745297192522
Amendment No 19 is also unacceptable, given my thoughts on Amendment No 10.	1.1365451441985726
The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal.	1.380768320288638
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable.	1.2160209026503799
As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term "self-employed" is concerned, the Commission will, as I have already remarked, provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged.	1.3283360060059555
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood' s remark.	0.725410024214061
He referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States, and this includes the United Kingdom, are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders.	1.3703229410665079
This applies, as already stated, to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium, where it was recently of relevance.	1.488727696122562
With regard to the remark made by Mr Karas, I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country.	1.287247259398394
The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU countries.	1.3797307253662021
The question is, furthermore, one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way.	1.2216519012686409
In my opinion, this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate.	1.3093897990296384
On behalf of the Commission, I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point.	1.243588496327789
I will keep myself free in this connection.	0.8047646134169779
Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and, in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Berger.	1.459572560888534
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.	0.8964582779371926
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.	0.5768350812905695
Court of First Instance	0.00940721208534589
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report, which, on reading it, gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council' s draft decision.	1.3114368137786916
However, this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results, such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency' s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation, composition and competences of the Community Courts.	1.3426901326021792
For this reason, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho.	1.0444867208739408
Mr President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if, in the future, we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales, and if, in the future, the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon.	1.5773064173483877
Today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market, and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests.	1.5393375053718672
Behind these principles, Mr President, lies the justice system.	1.1691918956510807
However, justice delayed is justice denied, and we must reflect on this notion.	1.634582388543926
The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information.	0.9712085685496503
For this reason, the draft reform, which has been drawn up by the rapporteur, Vice-President Marinho, is to be welcomed.	1.3080140371769333
It is true that it is a stopgap solution, but we must rely on stopgap solutions because, at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.543389108004235
We have to offer solutions which, while provisional, help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice.	1.4100077262221262
I would like to make two observations during this intervention, which stem from the report itself, given this Parliament' s obligation, in accordance with the Treaty, to produce a very succinct report, which does not go into depth.	1.4998129948968295
These are two of Vice-President Marinho' s ideas and, I believe, they are seconded by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	1.1457559992448816
The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance, and that they should be given one more référendaire.	1.4880098702191966
The second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated.	1.2227463858461964
At the moment, the Court of First Instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated.	1.2512139848925354
According to the Treaty, one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language.	1.2036840667355666
Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference, let us consider just two points.	1.0937421553805047
The first concerns this Parliament.	0.8437119290724794
I believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice, even in the appointment of judges.	1.2521729576817486
Above all, we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice, hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations, in other words, its resources.	1.2756045613461222
We wish to see its competences extended, especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible options, certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens.	1.4452302167689373
And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days.	1.3288905710805763
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report.	1.079860595406119
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency.	1.1769738026571452
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice.	0.7563079640224872
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT.	1.0885271456607637
The decision could have huge implications for our local economy.	0.8217205056612665
Secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age.	0.9896248539903657
These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe' s system of justice. Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy.	0.9708819891018107
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect, but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court.	1.5100572829333139
Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references.	1.0881633777267468
This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff, rather of the Court' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union.	1.3990455096685985
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative, but Europe is a legal construction, its courts are central to its proper functioning.	1.4098490891334587
In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system.	1.0941479332511646
Otherwise we will all, as elected representatives, be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice.	1.3183577541305835
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report.	1.0059675017108227
I also fully endorse his findings, in which, in particular, he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service.	1.2812464101507364
In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve.	1.3263913379647032
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here.	1.3184323450519044
For example, I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance, if applicable, and making this a final competence, in those spheres where benches of the Court, which resemble courts, pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law.	1.410591296065411
I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level.	1.272769291902448
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions.	1.3951205901890116
We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind.	1.0975727309147518
Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance.	1.0875421972777468
In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance.	1.3693499207118933
On a final note, I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law.	0.9553313852595119
As things stand, OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases.	1.0176414326761731
It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court.	1.2256654281951418
The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance.	0.9795990834729453
That would be another way of spurring the reform process on.	0.9611337576458362
Mr President, I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work.	1.0900481817292442
The European Union is a system based on law.	1.2945783064599923
It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law.	1.165296653061914
Furthermore, if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them, what happens, as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, is that justice delayed becomes, as we know, justice denied.	1.5097364415259336
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem.	1.229735810076248
However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC,	1.830007254682547
In my own country, mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges.	0.8285244571227349
There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system.	1.2295322899958048
The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo/French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union' s disputes resolution procedures.	1.1986260459324805
This has been compounded, so some who advise me believe, by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government.	1.3061962484923164
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible.	0.8647740628656724
This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable.	1.166167994172516
What is happening in France, Mr President, appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties.	1.2494127852615884
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings.	1.504068388070925
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this.	0.9174766676926067
Mr President, on behalf of Commission President, Mr Prodi, I would like to respond as follows.	1.347214581089672
The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The purport of this request is, on the one hand, to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance, such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and, on the other hand, to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance.	1.3510093782420145
May I add that, on behalf of the Commission, I listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas.	1.2845531292459464
The unease is justified.	0.43202385105138685
It has been said more than once: justice delayed is justice denied.	1.0101353388088774
The Commission sympathises with these considerations.	0.5862616421062512
In the light of this sympathy, I would like to continue my response as follows.	1.232340796004281
As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines.	1.5347831368485154
Consequently, the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades.	1.3894029372576098
The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First Instance to increase its number of judges, but at the moment, the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned.	1.2758621883805858
In other words, once this study is complete, the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible.	1.313459016602182
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.4314254166720252
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo	0.5167455501742584
The next item is the report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/00 - 1999/0240(CNS)).	0.7448822058445981
I have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes.	1.1340048006448231
I propose that we start the debate immediately.	0.8339353885286999
He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives.	0.9546531234476027
I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bourlanges, in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.	1.269212696380061
Mr President, this is an important and urgent matter, and Parliament is complying with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly, because today, you must realise, men and women are dying in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero, these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid.	1.496804900698505
An urgent request has been referred to us, and we approve it.	1.2551720897183818
We have been asked for EUR 35 million.	0.9636039172471915
We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring, once the decision has been taken, that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible.	1.312424433575826
We are talking about macrofinancial aid.	0.6642683927333201
There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration.	0.9661714489365235
This is not our opinion.	1.3984165842328558
Our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region.	1.1215432155022382
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state.	1.227291339658916
The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments, the donors have made commitments and, obviously, we are the only ones actually paying.	1.5553925496179748
The other parties are not paying.	0.6583848668979042
We wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regarding requests for financial aid.	1.0913631089778655
We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this.	1.4668209595691446
We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors.	1.1115116589175131
This is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but, quite the contrary, to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors.	1.3099564336804566
From that point of view, the proposed facility is a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest.	1.2031082264484874
Finally, we have three questions for the Commission in this regard. Firstly, we need the Commission to give us, on a regular basis, the list and the amounts that other donors contribute.	1.7692549007062643
When we come to pay, we want to know what the others are paying.	1.2257351237554213
Secondly, we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation.	1.1543889975773693
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet, according to our information, no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date.	1.1310900150040424
This is serious, since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo.	1.0531729377749464
Finally, and this follows on from what I have just said, we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis, monthly, regarding progress on payments made.	1.5481369672320984
We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments.	0.7062448000012886
It is not firm commitments that we need, just plain commitments would suffice, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, more especially, what has not been paid.	1.6225007741381448
Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment.	0.8390699407192224
Mr President, if we are going to discuss Kosovo today, as we have done many times before, then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo, or of whether in fact anything has been done at all.	1.5386834987776663
What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality, and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate.	1.2770397075649271
As of 9 February, there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council, which will comprise representatives of the political parties, the minorities and civil society, and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament.	1.487222090329372
This is a positive move and we welcome it, but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare, for elections are planned for the autumn.	1.5036709993583195
No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result.	1.1773977003005833
No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis UNMIK.	1.149031302961793
In other words, there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either.	1.165716292783732
Of all people, it is the Albanians, who are now being integrated into the transitional council, who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them.	1.4884960839392065
In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work, urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs, Albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the Roma of course - in this country, so that at some point in the near future, on the road to coexistence, it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place.	1.3932431722530678
I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about.	1.3839256519581389
Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors.	0.8984007835540696
That is excellent news!	0.5246191066586665
There too, people are being encouraged to pay their taxes, for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources.	1.3439792295439148
It should also be noted that of the 19 departments, 4 already have administrative leadership, which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto.	1.3116243119563311
There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law. We have 130 judges and public prosecutors, who have now been sworn in, and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice, with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little, and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions.	1.482357178687994
Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UCK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country.	1.2961346671373148
I believe that is a good thing	1.381463930577304
I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way.	1.315025807080433
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything.	0.7023102953099747
It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar, but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr Kouchner' s outstanding bills.	1.2049069580836316
One could do so once or twice, but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well, for there is a very large hole, as yet unfilled, that we are unable to fill.	1.4766211257727757
We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it.	1.3905979015508685
Mr President, I would like to offer a few explanations.	1.1240895357403982
In a debate, there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said.	1.531651281428389
However, I would like to concentrate on two points.	1.1363350809096402
Firstly, I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo.	1.3620737076330218
I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press is true, and that figures do not lie.	1.4009905260119024
Let us make this clear, however much some people may not wish to believe it.	1.3290495950593677
The Union has decided to assist with a further EUR 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo, on the basis of an IMF report which estimates that a further EUR 115 million is needed for that reconstruction.	1.1430436780577122
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I am in complete agreement with her when she says that the Commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments.	1.4018241612681277
I would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter, in any circumstances, the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin.	1.5500822291957441
This calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached, with great difficulty, with the Council in December, according to which, when the Commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction, the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary.	1.5188415228017094
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach.	1.1104012078733385
I would like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that Commissioner Solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme, with the corresponding report, requested by Parliament, so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up, as we have been promised.	1.4066342877257625
Lastly, I would like to insist that, although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now, we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough, and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo, which is so badly needed.	1.5000669032710345
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse my late arrival, but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the pity.	1.4204158524636623
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million, and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need.	1.0342780528538424
The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there.	1.0868402135471875
However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process.	1.3975141794435848
Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents.	1.4170997384970783
Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions.	0.930110677172838
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future.	1.0952584415928952
It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this.	1.2483380766373093
However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here.	1.3016346431834807
One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims.	1.217741293569946
In other words, we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres.	1.3041427219461335
Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there, we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into.	1.4852342456385592
This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations.	1.372477678939823
It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected.	1.3229177776287644
This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there.	1.247612190363611
This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence.	1.2642231140732512
We have so many coordinators, who, in turn, are responsible to so many employers, that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators.	1.3224958811762022
Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there.	1.3571120538273742
I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this, but if the European Union is doing the most work out there, then it should also be given the leadership, and bring coherence to the situation, so that we can be of real assistance to the people.	1.490661457470506
It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground!	1.1747716637393235
Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of March - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline, that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented, and there is a steady stream of new press conferences, this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe!	1.4866858278636212
Accordingly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative, so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month. Rather, we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country, and I hope that in the process, you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months.	1.4217292912676038
Mr President, when the Alliance intervened in Kosovo its objective was to re-establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return, with respect for their own heritage and their own culture.	1.3098311286169055
If the Alliance is still active in that region, it is with the same objective.	1.2178430320965077
The day before yesterday I was pleased to hear an interview given by the KFOR commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in Kosovo were starting to be, particularly as regards security, crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level.	1.1473481944355726
Those representing Europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective, and I am thinking in particular of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, are on the verge of despondency precisely because, since matters are improving, there is less talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent.	1.1908738243277115
We must work to ensure that, in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally, the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords.	1.4834814238045533
It is true that economic aid is, in this respect, certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level.	1.2223037499303466
Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we, the Members of the European Parliament, must fulfil our own obligations in this regard, while ensuring, of course, that we are not the only ones to do so.	1.3510216948944203
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for his report.	1.0930789135052557
If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on.	1.2580594749620282
The Council' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret.	1.131554052947566
The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should, and must, provide help swiftly, however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random.	1.3609482078958965
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point, which clearly emphasises that it is only possible, and permissible, to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public, communal and other authorities and institutions, which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK.	1.231915879913447
Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations, in particular Pillar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place.	1.5613109126086717
What is to be done with this money?	1.1200538161778646
I would like to highlight the issue of human rights.	1.00887558562119
The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today?	1.40583635132621
We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit.	1.0127943790166516
Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians.	1.3934115804191787
I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life.	1.2011699934646962
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated.	0.7112101693513553
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo.	1.3906961132272757
There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again.	1.1568686418300034
It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo.	1.118256382866284
It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo.	1.3883919815282268
What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together.	1.2851336243828364
We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough.	1.1883353994898431
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights.	1.5302204594957998
All of this needs to happen, and quickly too.	1.3071967031797984
If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise.	1.0113030030027184
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available.	1.6272135193617834
Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary.	1.5126352325581292
. (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue.	1.3783594010897529
This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned.	1.1120097628569325
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight' s debate.	1.0608884920931303
Firstly, although much progress has been made, and we could mention customs administration, bank administration or tax administration, it is true that we must continue to move forward.	1.4643438182384927
However, in moving forward, what should we be financing?	1.6991494296314453
This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement.	1.2884730933050135
In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds, for example, Amendments Nos 3 and 5.	1.150053342435228
In our view, however, in both respects, greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which, on the ground, is more aware of the reality than we are.	1.3745561269651057
We believe that to prejudge, at the moment, where resources should be directed, would create more practical difficulties.	1.3983701702935831
In short, we should put our faith in those parties who, in these areas, are better equipped than us to make certain decisions.	1.466715203371842
The second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges, but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors.	1.4087036535964321
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate?	0.9846864629606077
Some of the amendments in your report pose this question.	1.1821408375101294
For example, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4.	0.865480709187016
I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue, that this is not the fundamental problem, although we recognise it totally.	1.5470786401902015
The fundamental problem is that, at the moment, the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the High Level Steering Group, but it is also true that they have no legal status. This is simply a political commitment.	1.4206085491697107
That is the reason why, while accepting its spirit, we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources.	1.4413585598710161
I would say the same about Amendment No 2, which we would also accept with a slight modification, since the idea seems to us to be basically correct.	1.47447739443747
Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature.	1.0439521882072575
On this specific point, we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction.	1.194338575723524
We have already spoken to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision, establishing this element of conditionality.	1.4153920740917694
With regard to the second contribution, what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors.	1.3167623024152377
In other words, we should not establish conditionality, or we believe that it is more effective not to establish conditionality from the start, but, nevertheless, we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage.	1.560330334484753
In this way, we would have no problem in acting immediately. We would not create problems for the Kosovar people, but, on the other hand, we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing.	1.5572874026397132
A third problem has been raised by Mrs Dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes.	1.0643424441378935
I would remind you that these projects are multiannual.	0.965211395692345
The programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account.	1.049059994580878
Lastly, I would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us.	1.191056232152209
On the one hand, we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and, in this respect, I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament' s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in Kosovo.	1.3692909865257779
The Commission can commit itself to regularly informing Parliament of the invitations to tender which are published.	0.9779205680487691
We also wish to see these publicised on the Internet, so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point.	1.2518600154476667
A second point which I would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance.	1.2205602371081072
In this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed, on a confidential basis, if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality, on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance.	1.4608883545042297
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that, with the final decision of the Council, we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in Kosovo by different parties, so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see.	1.3331857161725753
Mr President, I am pleased to see the convergence of viewpoints there is between Parliament, particularly the Committee on Budgets, and the Commission, and we can assure you that, for our part, we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the performance of its duties.	1.6164767663849369
I do, however, have one small concern, when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets.	1.3929174152940413
There was a clear agreement, good or bad I will not say, but there was a contract. There was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7, i.e. on the idea of linking the mobilisation, the implementation, of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment.	1.5531203782100695
But, if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira says correctly, then this undertaking was only a tentative one.	1.3050086441869915
Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement.	1.6671563612971185
Can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on Budgets, yes or no? Or are you going to drop this proviso, thus breaking the undertaking made to us?	1.1715209379364737
No, Mr Bourlanges, I think it is a substantive problem.	1.6702936265643442
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted.	1.1576443653472588
What I proposed to you, and what I still say, is that the Commission will make a statement, in the Council Decision, something like this:	1.8121419547791195
The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors.	1.0474792652333722
With this, we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed.	1.5390035951216405
I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche.	1.4921146485652579
I agree, absolutely. We shall do so.	1.4153933310741855
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.4314254166720252
ALTENER	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD))	0.6411152583607225
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council.	1.3381650887682197
The project has been long and problematic.	0.76503304591715
In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources.	1.0723771744778525
Although there is much that is good about the new directive, it is nonetheless not without its defects.	1.3197100223763936
One example is the use of peat.	0.7834059042315099
Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels.	0.9596893501980704
If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned.	1.3728119740570628
It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal.	1.2834319840612434
The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union' s dependence on imported energy.	1.0992791964205548
Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU' s next round of enlargement.	1.0454733799744211
Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries, whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy.	0.9717139997895462
The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate.	0.9218506120847213
We are all concerned about the environment and our children' s future.	1.2773800389467664
The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased, but it has to be done in a rational manner.	1.196270070489001
We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come.	0.9927892310637899
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy.	1.0960110785464956
Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme.	1.375722611741681
Firstly, however, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the truly excellent work he has done on this report.	1.1651078904341576
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan.	1.2681036422683485
For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee.	1.2027807022147934
However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout.	1.4603353327746476
Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point, that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community.	1.1293985315005788
This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear.	1.578029902337789
However, we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed.	1.5410129045699923
For in the course of the next few years, the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double, accounting for at least 12% of energy consumption.	1.2632445587862775
This is the European Union' s declared aim.	1.4058675681187662
That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role.	1.3172981922383655
In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples.	1.2596262394008564
To my mind though, what is particularly important about the ALTENER II programme are the new actions for relieving market saturation by renewable energies and those for implementing, supporting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan.	1.2419805081634165
We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission' s services on a breakthrough campaign, which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy.	1.4686185057393222
It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors.	1.0887641381923674
It is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it.	1.1127611992051625
The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion.	0.8447876955563444
75%-80% of this is to come from private sources, and this will be supplemented by public funds from the Member States and from the regions.	1.4191076677832601
In this respect, the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment, and help us to realise our ambition, in the interests of environmental protection, the economy and creating new jobs.	1.4035609165196836
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mr Langen for his excellent work in this important matter.	1.1019514747458823
The conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the Altener programme as put forward by the Conciliation Committee is, after all the difficult phases it has been through, at least satisfactory.	1.4402532893388156
Most of Parliament' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive.	1.2087109234769107
The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy.	0.9531277149470425
There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets, however.	1.2172881936116473
The appropriations are needed for pilot projects, research, information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy.	1.0137170688520167
The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States.	1.0609428198798982
This programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy.	1.0583069988175717
However, in the future, the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market.	1.3581738529131406
Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment.	1.044912560063214
The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up.	0.9828080352191191
Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness.	0.8354333432144531
Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy.	1.021916984934717
We should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment.	0.9680772326003206
May I also venture to raise the matter of peat?	1.0178141194805344
Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources.	0.8458788616719032
However, it is important, at least in Finland, as a sustainably used, slowly renewable energy source.	1.4792359518664078
I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables.	1.2588957775710645
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are pleased with the agreement which has been found, and their thanks go to all those who negotiated so well in favour of an amendment which the Greens were almost the authors of.	1.2165020355023104
It is interesting for me, as a new Member of Parliament, to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation.	1.265135510095186
This is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale.	1.2828033001991894
In contrast with that, I see the amounts allocated for renewable energies, which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion.	1.4162792631924237
Seeing the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been capable of acquiring in this field, because they were the first ones to develop that area, gives one food for thought, I feel, and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies.	1.2828394935999967
One last word regarding the programme. I think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there.	1.4161757321258641
In order to ensure that at least 50% of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources, it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term.	1.261687443910849
Mr President, may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work.	1.0320917430783816
The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future.	1.0543979128248642
For this reason, I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises.	1.1201547366010078
The internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone.	0.9985817352501534
In this regard, it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit.	1.082037948082583
It is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables.	1.004219956300756
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend £125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector.	1.1303391460387975
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives.	0.9597658247252534
As the final text rightly states, actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities.	1.1353309283982214
I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster, a significant portion of which falls within Ireland' s only Objective I region.	1.2175382808332964
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions, including the energy sector.	1.1700427908273305
In short, we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol, while at the same time promoting growth in our economies.	1.1172556594171401
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States.	0.9924030470073691
Mr President, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, as our rapporteur mentioned, we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme.	1.496026169251137
Mr Langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the Council was initially FF 74 million, whereas the Commission proposed 81.1 million, a figure which the European Parliament supported.	1.4555091803163664
An initial conciliation meeting was not successful, because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.9 million.	1.168782426544087
We could not agree with a proposal like this, which challenged the authority of the European Parliament.	1.4662155215103525
A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million.	0.9999877325928902
In spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal, personally, once again I deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the Council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply, job creation and environmental protection, challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to.	1.3345825228535457
In fact, renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives.	1.155052253783256
However, in spite of the reservations I am expressing on the paucity of the financial allocation, I personally support the compromise, by virtue of the programme' s content, to which the European Parliament made an active contribution as, following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, this sector become subject to codecision.	1.4612853384004416
It is practically certain that, with the raft of proposed measures and actions, it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12% renewable energy share by 2010, doubling the current rate, as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available.	1.2519206231311568
This programme, together with the SAVE II programme, integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy, establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence.	1.0243030338739352
And, in conclusion, Mr President, let me also insist upon the fact that, in addition to the measures proposed, there are also legislative measures and, most especially, adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives.	1.347629602279354
And I shall end, of course, by congratulating Mr Langen, our rapporteur, on his work, as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee.	1.625566638108623
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the ALTENER II programme in the Conciliation Committee and associate myself with the comments of the different speakers and, of course, point out that this agreement will allow the ALTENER programme to be incorporated soon into the framework energy programme.	1.3078199689254955
All of this will provide greater coordination, transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes, into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme, which we will be discussing soon.	1.380756865383401
I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality, and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary.	1.4324916489628379
Obviously, there have been arguments, we had to go to conciliation, as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reminded us a moment ago, since at the first meeting no result was achieved, and there had to be a second meeting, despite the fact that the figures were not excessive.	1.5746569326322868
However, I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement, which, like all agreements, is perhaps not perfect, but which, I believe, allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing.	1.5362161742350948
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, to thank the speakers and, of course, to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure, who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result.	1.3506492096670455
I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council.	1.0094151197744554
SAVE	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD)).	0.7218429770876613
Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round, which is not always the case.	1.2622887275032062
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form.	1.2446283457717897
The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there.	1.312854144755126
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading.	1.1785482733869774
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments, including a re-instatement of the Commission' s original budget.	1.2528112791160115
The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable.	1.2088477215763318
During the procedure, agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise, implement, complement and assess the Community measures.	0.9888225494165349
Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and, very importantly, the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency.	1.1785900574596124
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress.	1.5826564569667485
The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council' s very meagre opening offer.	1.378187546180275
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount.	1.2278609491365455
We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under.	1.3181490511871643
This was an important consideration for us.	0.8852287704700833
I would like to say however that it is, and has always been, a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real.	1.532583459382259
Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States.	0.7026440484321713
We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme.	1.1947185423961761
If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level, this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action, including Community actions, on energy saving.	1.4099599905766431
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region.	1.0790421327936859
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard.	1.6532606868188522
SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy.	1.0639455657043206
It focuses on non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted.	1.3329505796705075
Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings.	1.269869473302504
We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business, saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical.	1.1856568661054416
It is something that we can all support.	1.1501128301643364
I have to say, like motherhood, although we all support it, sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving.	1.2549922477137943
We could do rather more, considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports.	1.2222927869553466
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see.	1.326296569728404
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change.	1.2176115350292445
If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do.	1.2723836006106695
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process.	1.0952785731016033
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal, since she has contributed, in collaboration with the other Members, to the achievement of a very reasonable final result, which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and, of course, on what, from a budgetary point of view, the Council had initially accepted.	1.5550158528151643
As Mrs Ahern has explained very well, the budgets of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme, are basically symbolic budgets, since the burden is shouldered by the countries, the States of the Union, the regions or even, in some cases, the local authorities.	1.4475044252021658
However, despite the fact that the volume is relatively small, it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action, which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments. This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources, greater safety in our energy supplies and, in the case of SAVE, to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy, thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set.	1.4410398720856852
Furthermore, behind these programmes, that is to say, the SAVE programme, which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings, and the Altener programme, which concerns renewable energy, there lies an extremely important technological challenge, which, from an economic point of view, may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole.	1.4648476091834095
With regard to the parliamentary procedure, I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken, especially the rapporteur, because the majority of Parliament' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council, in this case practically all of them, although with some modifications. I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved.	1.4026626480892865
This improvement has been achieved with fresh funds, as we said at the time, and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament' s prerogatives and competences.	1.3954851332846194
From the point of view of the Commission, in this interinstitutional game, I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it.	1.5547698540434163
I would like once again to thank all the speakers, and also, especially, the Vice-President, Mr Provan, for his magnificent work throughout this debate, particularly during the conciliation procedure, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry and, also, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Ahern, and all the Members who have participated in this work.	1.5232959054316033
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.4314254166720252
CULTURE 2000	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ('Culture 2000') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD)).	0.723124250946292
Madam President, I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate.	1.447019514842776
Unfortunately, there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it.	1.2966976872447862
We have the feeling, and are in fact convinced, that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht.	1.5614503824147463
For no one is very keen to spend money on culture.	0.9536511875749034
Sadly that is the case and we must face facts.	1.5955502341211854
I would like to thank the rapporteur, who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task, in conjunction with the Commissioner of course.	1.2693433897745503
We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect.	1.2801004046499767
One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind, where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision.	1.1412403352401201
What kind of horse-trading system is this?	0.6850908631402
Certainly not a fair one! There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side, begging for a little more money for culture.	1.3877095947865505
It is downright scandalous what goes on!	0.5607791416653869
It is an awful sort of horse-trading, based on unequal positions!	1.0170613411990554
Nevertheless, we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to.	1.4542335842152863
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us.	1.021185110862975
We will support small and medium-sized events, not the large ones, and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access.	1.431780296613654
I believe that the fact that Culture and, fittingly, Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner' s remit, will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes, which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the European Union.	1.3158517447501572
If one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied, but then only a tiny bit.	1.1894982925877382
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money.	1.1870712315156307
Madam President, I agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and I must add that, during the conciliation procedure, I was personally a little disappointed with the Council.	1.3478586532966832
On the one hand, it continued to refuse to accept the term "European cultural policy" or other similar terms, even undervaluing the terms of the Treaty, and it defines "Culture 2000" simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more.	1.3215541394093002
On the other hand, it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this Parliament, which were minimal anyway.	1.4217749583831831
Incidentally, this last point would be unfair to fourteen Members of the Council, since it was just one, the Netherlands, which was responsible for that intransigence.	1.61784748682051
It has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council.	0.8484188559313225
This demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution.	0.9943395747876831
However, Madam President, these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow, and which the Socialists will vote in favour of, will put in place one of the European Union' s most important programmes.	1.7075710847316048
By taking action in the field of culture, we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul, especially given the fact that the sub-programmes which make up "Culture 2000" are superb.	1.2935664760060726
In recent years, these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the youngest and most dynamic citizens of the European Union.	1.0067108916117296
Lastly, I would like to mention the profoundly human impression I have formed of the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura: his knowledge, his sense of balance, his intellectual qualities, make him, in my opinion, the best possible rapporteur this report could have had.	1.2573053088659751
Congratulations!	-0.0
Finally, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Reding, Vice-President Imbeni and Mr Gargani, chairman of the Committee on Culture, for the firm and intelligent position which, each within his own role, they have maintained during the entire conciliation process.	1.202272715873872
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would like to start by thanking Mr Graça Moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this Culture 2000 programme.	1.1516945348633754
It has been said before, and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions, that culture is, of course, extremely important as an area unto itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for furthering the European idea.	1.3801717677282057
It is also of great importance to citizens.	1.521473574441758
We should, above all, not lose sight of this. The impetus given to the European idea by this programme is having an enormous impact, especially on small linguistic areas such as the Netherlands which not only has national potential, but is also relying on support from the programme, mainly from a language point of view.	1.3972260666219751
Today, we have arrived at the end of a long road.	1.1611073204921154
I would nonetheless like, as others have done, to touch upon the procedure, which is unclear and, above all, unwanted.	1.3480693434160775
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand.	0.8367332500448544
They are like a snake biting its own tail.	0.7538223730823326
There is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand: anything is open for discussion, as long as the budget stays fixed.	1.1961993420621095
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage.	1.4088065969517347
The result is 30% growth, so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result.	1.4766317546809635
Of course, it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes.	1.5339388971452226
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot.	1.2471253897134695
Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas.	1.001096566252701
A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds, and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind.	1.207908415329075
Fortunately, I am on the Committee on Regional Policy.	1.7155357593231884
So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention.	0.8825047322125279
I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because, if it happens to be cancelled, then surely this does not benefit the citizen.	1.5369707217583573
I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect.	0.98668550137266
However, I do think that it is necessary, as he always states too, that, in the next IGC, changes will be made to codecision, when unanimity will no longer be necessary.	1.7875349076491682
We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made: no more mega-projects, room for cultural networks, and sufficient attention to promoting reading, translating and translation companies.	1.1902455587340453
This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000.	1.1992887700127721
All that remains for me to say is: time to get down to business.	0.9848817115155692
Madam President, all that I wanted to say has been covered by those fellow Members who spoke before me and I think there is unanimity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture.	1.574559433137519
I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart.	1.4518237942190988
Not because our delegation, our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding' s attitude - I think that, given the framework she was operating in, her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council.	1.41775516813775
It is shameful!	0.34353144694827287
That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union!	1.135908287326613
When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, pioneering activities in the arts, writers, to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign, something opposed, contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro, not just enlargement, nor geostrategic expedients, but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end.	1.3174436882432368
	-0.0
	-0.0
So long as we continue to have unanimity, so long as yesterday the Dutch Government was able to impose those EUR 167 million as an ultimatum and so long as a government with Mr Haider will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue, we will never progress.	1.238832814088513
That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the European Parliament' s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments.	1.2692305140391904
Madam President, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur' s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Mr Gargani, for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also, considerably difficult.	1.3746391161917797
Of course, we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes, but everyone hoped that the Culture programme could help to promote, for example, the unique features of each cultural sector, even - and I could say especially - of the unique features of less well-known sectors.	1.4581564900942194
We hope that this, at the least, will come about during the evaluation process.	1.5659518109674757
We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action, among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social, as well as economic, development of a people.	1.3155370742660246
And a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its roots, highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known.	0.9891991776861732
As for the important educational task which the European Union must carry out as regards culture, one of the programme' s most obvious limitations is the level of funding - we have heard this several times - which censures the fact that the Council at least - certainly not the Commissioner - is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action: the document which prioritises the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this.	1.4586188663355806
The overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens: this is why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme, albeit with a scarcity of funds, can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal.	1.3314623325671489
Madam President, I will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that I support the adoption of Culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, who took over from our former colleague Nana Mouskouri.	1.3262763871267682
Both of them have done a first-class job.	1.067713625686173
Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day, culture may not seem that important, but it is; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important.	1.452085718327861
Why do I say that culture is important?	1.0188270651178246
Well in simple economic terms, Europe' s culture adds to genuine prosperity.	0.8337613450506021
Where would Europe' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture?	0.9391761804576573
But, more importantly than that, cultural activities are what make mankind civilised.	1.3350356460000932
Culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs; and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy.	1.1651778286197145
Cultural diversity is important, and it is under threat.	0.999175591015648
However, it is not under threat from Europe.	1.4428292167712156
Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat, for example, from Portugal, from Germany, from Finland, for heaven' s sake.	1.4639464045997843
We do drink port wine, and we do like German beer, and we even use Finnish saunas, but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat.	1.4040443282785364
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola, eating hamburgers, wearing baseball caps, watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time.	0.933763684339939
Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe' s culture, but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can.	1.4426758891819698
That is what Culture 2000 is about.	0.94069373530514
So, I say to the Council of Ministers: Keep this programme genuinely under review.	1.4819777051259435
Are we doing enough?	0.7098817057101605
And, I say to Madame Reding, thank you for the support and the help you have given so far, keep up the good work, we are on your side.	1.5156956153299965
Madam President, I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Graa Moura, and Commissioner Reding, for their contribution to the creation of this programme.	1.4077531502239953
The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council.	1.108268500063968
The outcome can be considered reasonable, when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the Council.	1.4097747087970696
We have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture.	1.3669922741509433
It is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the Council.	1.1359501429132555
The framework programme on culture is replacing the present Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael programmes.	0.8534228338036134
When implementation of the programme begins, I hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full. I believe and hope that, despite the assault on us all of the new technology, literature will maintain its status.	1.412398291888172
We need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial.	1.0325823695725747
Literature likewise plays an important part in the way it transmits our cultural heritage, increases mutual familiarity and preserves linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongues.	1.0401249888261515
In this connection, I am very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon, the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries.	1.379113271168556
I hope that this conference will also encourage the Commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society.	1.3039047493502833
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, somehow or other, today' s agenda has come full circle.	1.1769949835758666
We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values, about tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive approach to the enlargement process, transparency and respect for each other.	1.3313853226584749
Youth, education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values, for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes.	1.2423328645871798
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union' s goals.	1.3854780579490669
Cultural activity creates identity.	0.44134755032973255
Cultural activity is an expression of individuality, of an individual' s own personality; it builds relationships and communicates.	1.2451592115269219
We want a colourful Europe.	0.8912811532634805
We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity.	0.9388589460662745
We want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences.	0.9093180784412419
That is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget, the allocation of funds that is, into the different types of measure.	1.2188862559796134
That is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures, because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals; because we want to see thousands of flowers bloom.	1.2118385943989134
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say.	1.106997980449508
There is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle, codecision procedure, and Conciliation Committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen, and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European consciousness.	1.4704540770841017
Madam President, as we have heard, all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council.	1.3243493934695223
It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure, for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests.	1.4735765966909788
In this way, the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order.	1.2891907942226395
The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years, and now, at long last, the European Parliament can give the go-ahead.	1.351465371195234
The Council could not be moved, not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael finished.	1.0240763272059072
A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap.	0.7281736976320198
This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union' s cultural policy activities once again.	1.0780916780947198
The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support.	0.8157781042560392
Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered.	0.9212508924527145
The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro!	1.173185565835236
And so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004.	0.7853552806469294
That is the same as a single, medium-sized, German opera house' s expenditure over the same period, when here in Europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years!	1.1323449505319645
There is a blatant discrepancy here!	1.0529031854824056
And so we are going to have to be content, albeit very grudgingly, with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content.	1.2961622259538061
Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out.	0.804862437555562
We can only hope that it will, after all, be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day.	1.4109105555935686
Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good, not harm!	1.578226096025117
Cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity, far more so than any transport directive, however important it might be.	1.4304996979152702
Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance, and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions.	1.2792087200085986
What, may I ask, is the Council afraid of?	1.3624441701364687
Madam President, whoever has the honour, like myself, to chair the Committee on Culture, cannot fail to agree with the comments from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur, and Commissioner Reding, with whom he worked and who, even during the conciliation process, had difficult moments and opposed the Council - you have heard this said by everyone.	1.496719752323306
I have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at European organisational level has been firmly asserted, but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the European States will make.	1.3920408344694366
I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because, in the end, we did not manage to adopt a review clause.	1.153097831431587
However, Mrs Reding was certainly receptive and farsighted, and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years, and therefore to change the situation.	1.5708600546751872
The cultural programmes launched in years past - Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael - are being replaced by a single programme, Culture 2000, where - and I must stress this here very forcefully - the rapporteur censures a position which should give the European Parliament cause for reflection - as someone said this afternoon - but which still underlines the huge importance of being part of a vast community where cultural interpretation is a democratic factor.	1.554022441824559
This is not rhetoric, but the new embodiment of a modern liberalism which unites the European States and constitutes a turning point for the European Parliament and the Commission.	1.3860970443780474
We agree with this approach and despite the lack of funds, this evening' s result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for Europe, which will then give rise to an economic factor and a growth factor; culture then, and an institutional aspect, the basis for structuring a vast community, a prerequisite for economic growth, and not the complete opposite, as Europe, in its cultural habits, has perhaps been used to viewing things in the past.	1.5308657865127004
Man and culture are priorities, and culture can result in economic growth.	1.1422279764616858
Let us contemplate this result, derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy.	0.889025880425122
Madam President, may I first thank Mr Graça Moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry.	1.1091370170973116
It seems to me when entering the conciliation process for Culture 2000, having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate.	1.169146265781002
Again, because these conciliations are not entirely straight forward, we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our Community.	1.2911606690784765
The fundamental question, it seems to me, that faces this Parliament, the Commission and the Council is: What is Europe?	1.5384375967773172
What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries?	1.033787062249273
Europe is its people, its history and now its collectivity; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this: I will wager that when we ask the question - 'What is Europe?' - we answer it by saying, 'It is our art, it is our literature and it is our heritage.'	1.5862336608776215
That is what Culture 2000 represents.	0.8577716850525265
It represents the possibility of sustaining a European identity in the twenty-first century, an identity which eschews the echoes of division, of war, of poverty, of opportunity, of poverty dans la realité.	1.3052238353918084
And more than this - and this is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive, that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require.	1.3007241350087455
It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.	1.1775109162594033
My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver.	1.1489617339510352
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of a long road.	1.275997253307704
Following the conciliation stage, our institutions can now formally adopt the new 'Culture 2000' framework programme.	1.1754572232649378
We shall thus, in the course of the next five years, have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear, well-structured and, I am sure, successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector.	1.3119585097911177
It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this 'happy ending' in this House, and I thank you for it.	1.240771510520813
I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process.	1.3594353384812439
I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, particularly to its rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, its chairman, Mr Gargani, the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups, the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr Imbeni.	1.5008056681130677
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution.	0.788695884556446
Throughout the negotiations, they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time.	1.170489042372035
We now have a framework programme, the first of its type for the cultural sector, and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive, but also more thorough and detailed manner.	1.5188364524494586
I would like to express my delight, with you, at this pleasing outcome. In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions, these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani has just said, that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment.	1.3977575763187131
It stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision, it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme, and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the Community financial perspectives.	1.5959640732659293
If need be, the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision, and this should be achieved by 30 June 2002.	1.3871793366330651
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a formal commitment, not just words on paper.	1.4693528477702342
All this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area, within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features, in all their diversity, but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them.	1.402419018614807
It is thanks, too, to Parliament' s action, preferring a number of small-scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale.	1.1968909855141372
This is going to lead us to make 'Culture 2000' the programme of the citizen.	1.1292760950568044
The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and pray for. I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality.	1.395581794831194
I know that you, as Members of Parliament, in your own regions and countries, are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers, as one Member of Parliament said, go to make a vast multicoloured carpet.	1.6944631102260648
I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens, both in personal as well as in social and economic terms, but a right which it is our job to assert, and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union.	1.4269751127448054
This is what our European 'Culture 2000' programme offers.	1.1727907162813025
It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States.	0.9186421936445776
Such policies are necessary, and I would like to see them developed further.	1.360346034794835
It simply adds to them, complements them, building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries.	0.9453968641976062
I feel therefore that extending and enriching European citizens' participation in culture is a crucial task, one which justifies the efforts we make to achieve it, and this is the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union.	1.3395164876758505
A number of Members of Parliament have quite rightly raised this point. If the Union is purely an economic union, then it is a stillborn project.	1.6289118456177467
However, if it is a union of culture, civilisation and participation, then it becomes a living thing.	1.403823502966403
This is the foundation, ladies and gentlemen, which I intend to develop, and I shall take the following five areas into special consideration: firstly, providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserves in our programme.	1.367293222959302
Secondly, encouraging exchanges, mobility and training in the cultural sector.	1.0795642624885822
Thirdly, promoting cooperation between cultural operators.	1.06497009837038
Fourthly, increasing audiences for culture, with particular emphasis on attracting young people to culture and, fifthly, protecting the common cultural heritage on the European scale as well as the history of the peoples of Europe, and making them better known.	1.3885067874246788
The new programme will, I am sure, in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency, efficiency and balance, prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures.	1.3698663230175372
Madam President, I reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its support and for, once again, having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the Union.	1.2384276354827763
I am certain that it will not be disappointed, having given us its support, and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed, as things progress, of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens, which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union.	1.5579402266082376
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again.	1.594955821817109
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.4314254166720252
(The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.)	0.7100784159456167
End-of-life vehicles	0.06620548174863751
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles [8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	0.8959568751641409
Mr President, nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe.	1.1326162637404225
Even though they can no longer be driven, these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders; and not just intra-Community borders, but also those outside the Union.	1.2710130864165625
It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed.	1.32509506524985
We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking.	1.3459610215043225
We therefore have a number of amendments.	1.065553457122703
I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective.	1.3401969847941164
I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive.	1.2355103219737789
Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included, as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a European directive in this area.	1.3447130111848424
I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either.	1.1240136929511388
I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas.	0.7830565009534436
This is my main concern in this matter.	0.9728701197354729
In my opinion, the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe.	1.0825485367594414
This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars.	1.3043858846227179
This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc.	0.8512225284646417
An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts.	1.2429633298848708
What should we do with the shredded products?	0.9111827136348138
We should not overlook the fact that, although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery, they are by no means the only point.	1.3958411273324143
Do not forget that, in the case of cars, 80% of environmental impact comes through driving, 1% through recovery and 19% through construction.	1.1853241207287588
Quotas are not, therefore, the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility, just one of many.	1.3102603460920055
Of course we need to aim high, but quotas must not become an end in themselves.	1.3990787881099243
We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars.	1.0579692847646285
I am far keener to see us move away from today's car, weighing 1,400 kg and driving an average of 200,000 km, to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just 1,000 kg.	1.0384086211236654
This would at least mean 400 kg times 200,000 km less transportation.	0.7893366842957376
This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which, if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol, is the important factor.	1.3256731732314302
We therefore consider that, in future, vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quotas.	1.0239514944886914
It should not be for each Member State, but for you and your staff, Commissioner, to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles (and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles) should receive preferential treatment.	1.3581745774200247
We think they should.	0.5082035590706647
May I say something about costs.	0.927198077661096
Some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer.	1.4036959527743738
However, this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycling.	1.2748492879018791
I can only warn you against consenting to this.	0.9117905513100716
There are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car.	0.8352098670953146
The money from this pool, system, or however you want to picture it, would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder.	1.3232471278153715
This too is a particular desire of my group.	1.0468747763380069
Our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage, namely that we won't be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive is adopted.	1.2341166690774314
The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions, which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly.	1.4230529604219437
This is why I propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer.	1.0614797142321621
As for a ban on certain materials: of course we need one!	1.3877674420985795
A car has dangerous components which we must ban long-term.	1.016824994036268
This means that we need a pressure instrument.	1.162850488857232
The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives.	1.3135911433742007
There are a number of sound amendments.	0.5630261115005553
This Parliament has been given more authority, so let us use it!	1.4243642755941108
Let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive.	0.8451811717905515
A directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this House.	1.1254010702245294
I ask for your support.	0.7815352462468835
Mr President, I almost feel like saying, "Phew" , now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which has given us so much work, and which has clearly also given a great deal of work to the rapporteur, Mr Florenz.	1.5732914604208865
I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which, today, can only be removed at local authority expense, i.e. the taxpayers' expense.	1.2625262796570937
The principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied.	0.5941201837956714
Vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by Community legislation, in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end-of-life vehicles.	1.2576194239345109
The only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future.	1.311795249245119
It has not, however, been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle.	1.384375758459832
On the other hand, we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find (a) materials that are easier to recycle and (b) to set up recycling industries.	1.2336797381986278
I should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycling, reuse and incineration, as far as the new particularly light materials are concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emissions.	1.1299900873290367
This is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end-of-life vehicles and the former directives, including the one on auto-oil, which we voted on a few years ago.	1.478278845639652
We must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on having the wisdom, in order to make things perfectly clear, to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage.	1.2061796867915262
In conclusion, let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still clutter our forests, lakes and gardens.	1.1221511767842656
Once again, the principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied. The taxpayer is still footing the bill.	1.017866629532645
Mr President, Commissioner, reading the leaflets which have been distributed in recent weeks, one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in Europe.	1.4020170576817925
Neither is correct.	0.3465661310016468
We simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive.	1.2042879245049518
It means ecological progress for Europe, and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion.	1.107170574833953
All the same, there is one point on which we are in conflict.	1.6138845147242824
In the grand scheme of the directive, it is perhaps a minor point, but nevertheless a disputed one.	1.2871431999083132
It concerns the issue of recycling costs.	0.9420651100563789
Here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year's debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs.	1.0911240621380063
Last February in this House we unambiguously decided (and we Social Democrats are sticking to this) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question!	1.1712660943369038
So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of?	0.9325603718756094
For us this is straightforward: in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars.	1.2123126823997568
And what about vehicles which are already on the road?	0.9654249251010476
Let us look at an example. Rover in Great Britain, if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars, would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs, whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts, as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it.	1.2292993713513578
Such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in Europe.	0.9393112919609572
Consequently, for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs.	1.3589731355070358
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds.	1.1688115387561624
However, I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in Europe, so that these jobs can be secured in the future.	1.2912535412294817
I am in favour of stringent environmental requirements, as you know from the auto-oil programme and the debate on exhaust emissions, but I believe that they should be the same for everyone!	1.372222111702623
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we need this directive.	1.3376409775552243
Firstly, because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives.	1.560699302671931
Secondly, because it can promote recycling, which is important.	1.8703184999586948
Thirdly, because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals.	1.473883987651219
This is also an important point.	1.1880412449649145
The directive affords a European framework, also to Member States who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these.	1.308778683115591
So, first of all, we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level. This will, of course, provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of.	1.260048700691177
Secondly, we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position.	1.1355202704717433
As from 2006, therefore, all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners.	1.1165318361185774
Needless to say, this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way.	1.242015767325165
Is this too much of a burden?	0.8626774724905338
There is, however, one thing we should not overlook.	1.4994953288938742
The directive applies to complete cars, that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing.	1.1380431563633169
According to the experts, few of these complete cars are of no value.	0.8999894438146119
After all, recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making.	1.2265261550436726
Quite the reverse, in fact. At present, there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them, and a decent one at that.	1.3406661105995648
This directive encourages the whole of this sector.	1.0847092822118523
It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses.	0.9811353062356858
Since, in this case, transport costs are high, a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised, because transporting an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity.	1.4985717498454956
I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles, and I think we ought to add this provision to it.	1.4606160700286723
I think, therefore, that vintage cars ought to be exempt.	1.0109007613544352
Also, it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer.	1.3100811908772931
That is a basic principle which we must uphold.	1.2441866342697456
As manufacturers are responsible for the design, they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase.	1.3846223309575334
We must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer, as stipulated in the common position.	1.216780085114737
I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things.	1.0098934352225224
I think we need to retain it.	1.178532854338513
This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence.	1.478240419773369
After all, we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about, and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position.	1.456714956116001
In my opinion, we should not jeopardise that common position, because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons.	1.3652385219622463
I would ask you to support this common position.	0.8495546471710327
Our group will, at any rate, do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including, for example, the way in which the costs are to be distributed.	1.4268608922347157
Mr President, we need to take an important decision today.	1.448390166510586
Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer' s liability, that is to say that cars, once they have reached the end of their lives, are the responsibility of the car manufacturer?	1.3984811198629425
No, according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. 38: car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50/50.	0.9330851952197357
It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50/50 compromise is included that this does not work.	0.9694481350990961
Packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment.	1.0247324345582998
Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45.	1.2667088028000963
The common position stipulates 2006.	1.0050974715238759
According to the group of the Greens, this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations.	1.3027901114330147
I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists.	1.1469283281032363
If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply.	1.2246752109955052
The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic.	0.9407510126341232
This is ultimately cheaper, also for the consumer.	1.1489092833077081
For twenty years, the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener.	1.2816534638545758
Today, this green position is being threatened under pressure from, in particular, the German and French car industries.	1.371456672066138
That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45.	1.167277507076047
We, the Green Group, by and large support the common position.	1.282194864093612
Mr President, the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances.	1.1325693120567382
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area.	0.9520589866061473
With this directive, we have the chance to take a big step forward, but this presupposes that the Council' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament' s reading of it.	1.3043229263661873
If they were adopted, many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive.	1.069031750459934
This applies, above all, to amendments from the Group of the European People' s Party but also, unfortunately, to some of the amendments from Mr Lange, as I see it.	1.3462791678778185
It is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries, for example in Germany, went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted.	1.1424428829411621
For ourselves, it is crucial that the following principles should apply.	1.0900435401077992
The polluter should pay.	0.5035848075733864
This means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility, financial as well as otherwise, for recycling vehicles.	1.6178626976557227
There must be rules governing existing vehicles too.	0.8465806145793219
Where this aspect is concerned, we cannot accept any weakening of the Council' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force.	1.3596723616803743
There should be no falling-off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years, and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead.	1.2325035376230773
We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations.	0.9179109814285424
If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive, this would be very detrimental, not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament' s credibility on environmental issues.	1.2628099509973314
Reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries, for example my own country, Sweden.	1.4196889635095704
I was myself a car worker before I was elected.	0.8344726827781664
I believe I am one of the few members of this Parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars.	1.2209254040140878
I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry.	1.221151751054457
These would, of course, be to the advantage of modern, progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms.	1.0978925282040644
It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union.	1.2926520708122544
Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament, as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe.	1.5091826904407373
There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment.	0.8703284977546724
Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests.	1.27222214458231
Each year, there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union. This in itself generates a large amount of waste.	1.2821132870780998
Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars.	1.0433129054517967
We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union.	1.0926901146656893
From an Irish perspective, I know that the Irish Department of the Environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicles.	1.223767212315933
I see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across Europe for collection centres to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disposed of within the European Union on an annual basis.	1.0483159120064311
Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use, recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years.	1.1854016810233927
In accordance with new provisions included in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 370 million consumers within the European Union have a right to consumer-related information.	1.1395010017251523
I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year.	1.030471195816996
My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations.	1.3674288907066867
Mr President, the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe.	1.0682904080540783
I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials, a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation.	1.303968906891021
In this regard, we are certainly on the right track, but as some Members have already stressed, the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers' responsibility will become a shared responsibility.	1.4870927866648942
I would like to say that in Italy, considerable headway has been made in this sector; we are perhaps the first in Europe to have regulations encouraging us to take end-of-life vehicles off the market, but in our country the average age of cars on the road is rather high, and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could entail for the market.	1.5132540469562383
We need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter.	1.0069878380997217
In Italy, we have begun to withdraw and recycle around 80% of old cars, but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in Italy industry often resorts to lay-offs and redundancies - and cause problems for workers in different parts of Italy.	1.2772265013843267
We must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements - Parliament is sometimes a little extremist, adopting positions that are either extremely pro-green or extremely anti-green - and, all things considered, find a way to combine the effort made by Mr Florenz and that of other Members, who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible.	1.315785794253547
These worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this; I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem, that is, to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements.	1.2581493330201996
Mr President, this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life.	1.3245546911894706
To that extent, it might be thought desirable, even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity.	1.3567557878751886
The key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year?	0.8763443404035546
Who pays for the collection, the dismantling, the disposal and so on?	1.4059102390839253
And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made?	0.8866153809185522
The proposal from the Council, the common position, is that manufacturers should pay the lot.	1.3738252455732707
That would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the European Union.	1.0245899204217477
That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars.	0.8594721037914714
Because European car manufactures have been operating here for many, many more decades than companies from Japan, Korea and elsewhere, that would be a much greater burden on the older European companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere.	1.1212098332812948
I commend Mr Florenz, Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs.	1.1729472338311933
I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Britain, to remove the retrospective nature of this measure.	1.10268973525858
Retrospective law is bad law, it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law.	1.2107898808458948
Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest, which clearly there is not in this case.	1.3615212706606061
That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this.	1.1952016655027078
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality, which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry.	1.2913282154298515
Mr President, once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive, and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange.	1.415402081689692
These amendments actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives.	1.1881205239389458
The Council' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all, or a significant part, of the costs of recovery and recycling.	1.623871507016773
But, as Mr Lange so rightly said, this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers.	1.4289334463025702
Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry, I can tell you that it is not possible, retroactively, to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road, i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe.	1.3388016974568917
This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs.	1.081288225043503
The common position puts European car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market.	1.2656650726921754
Of course, we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby. We are here to build a Europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive.	1.3864828589498919
This is why, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange. These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints, since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States, and some of them work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate.	1.4024757886956964
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector.	1.238342239877087
Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive.	1.1247143780067967
Cars are also part of our cultural heritage. I think we would all agree on that.	1.4710757940126589
Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force.	1.1509569290868753
Parliament' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic.	1.356154573549676
The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling.	1.146107944213746
The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road.	1.0556149562933017
This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses.	1.1019696205947895
Like my group, I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel, offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection.	1.3619605509443877
Mr President, the European Parliament is today facing an important decision.	1.3511256047699163
Will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or, as the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others cause me to fear, will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry?	1.162558225065054
The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake.	0.987280345210527
It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection!	1.4383069090330347
The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious: to sabotage the directive!	0.9562183028374986
The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation.	0.7602526064203945
In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more.	0.9724921242973348
This is totally unacceptable.	0.5202875619984068
I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today!	0.976660472704403
The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive.	0.9333265819676844
Do not continue in this vein!	0.804241329987839
The whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the German car industry.	0.8348260729651319
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers!	1.0201702171077716
Vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry!	1.11782377972252
Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997.	1.4039327699211617
It is high time that we reached an agreement.	0.7177285338795184
Since I more or less share the views of my colleague, Mr Sjöstedt and the representative of the Greens, Mr de Roo, I am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me, and I will highlight just two issues.	1.3605078789945693
Firstly, and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal, the idea, which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste, that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution.	1.5802223236291872
Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed, not only in the case of lead, cadmium and mercury, but also in the case of waste which contains PVC.	1.2473981784799737
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context.	1.011958664232067
The other question is who should bear the cost.	0.9512339246871159
I agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay, and this proposal expresses that idea very well.	1.303840661919317
Producers must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006, as some of the amendments propose.	1.6239073964641193
We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading.	1.042073430361104
It is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials.	1.0455440313865545
I believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines.	1.1868988005552523
Lastly, Mr President, I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which, if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised, can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area, preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies.	1.2824619413492073
Mr President, today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities.	1.5563289417658082
We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year.	1.3194088760426108
In some of our Member States, voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our ditches, canals and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks, inhabited occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken.	1.0481080240071048
I come, of course, from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third countries.	1.3465863179177986
I can gauge its importance for my country' s international reputation.	0.7681655299715631
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles.	1.1473469121828412
I am aware of the difficulties the Council experienced in finding a compromise.	0.9219871274765118
That is why, today, we must be understanding alchemists, concerned for our environment.	1.252139148446847
This will either be the century of waste management or it will not.	1.0342027637760434
As far as I am concerned, at least, the principle of 'polluter pays' must be applied.	1.1733777258519589
The car industry, increasingly more respectful of the environment, has, I am sure, anticipated this kind of increasing awareness.	1.3078130184935692
Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities.	0.7499279060110585
It is the Member States, however, who will have to implement this directive, and let us beware of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions, the demolition and crushing sectors vary according to whether you are in Italy or in Finland.	1.3891867730959118
I am opposed to making the car owners liable.	0.7721209291299035
The men and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter, pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement.	1.0186613116789192
It would certainly be unwise for my fellow Members in the major groups of the federalist tendency to seek to make the European Parliament unpopular in this way by creating a liability shared between the owner and the manufacturer.	1.2568379673639156
How, furthermore, can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within Europe.	1.0953355828109559
Who is to pay for recycling the car I bought in France if I register it in Belgium?	1.0338168099420906
Which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle?	0.8867257989451723
Let us beware, too, of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application.	1.2135102626906884
It is not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today, but to continue on our present course, advocating sustainable development.	1.4512357783192713
Mr President, most of the time, the European Parliament, spearheaded by environment committees, does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the European Commission or the Council, so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view.	1.4196192182856646
Now, a sound common position submitted by the Council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in Parliament.	1.2825487284774653
Every year, we discard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances.	1.080240627283955
This is why it is important to prevent waste materials.	1.1485606852069354
We should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals, as well as of other dangerous substances and materials.	1.1389163073058557
In addition, car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re-use.	0.9939698218381794
What is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately.	0.771010623470861
I therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re-use and recycling which have been proposed by the Council.	1.0537113759065893
These days, the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable.	0.9711631599399251
This means that we move away from shredding.	0.9723337771005652
The prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and, in the Netherlands, a value of 86% recycling has now already been achieved.	1.3462470110658293
The best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and/or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost.	0.9854711271153782
The processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars.	0.8481568651071935
The proposals made by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system.	0.87549094856778
The so-called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation.	0.6807477214892675
If the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied, it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably.	1.2192115734918016
Finally, this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity.	1.381847998965767
A laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay, at the expense of the environment.	1.0949818960261075
Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled? If we are, then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achieved.	1.3907974771624958
Mr President, I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem.	1.1321804453528055
He has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry.	0.9712259441880798
Add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and, against that background, find a compromise. That was not easy.	1.439496954711502
Overall, I am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position.	1.2901029854941617
I would like to comment on two things. Firstly, vintage cars and motorbikes.	1.0744895059786073
These should indeed be excluded from the directive. Secondly, the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars.	1.3025091593414573
I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way.	1.264524792912971
The manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and/or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost.	0.936390413324054
In my opinion, there is too much initial hesitation.	1.2649838053722215
The car lobby has led too many people up the garden path.	0.9586878946780855
I would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on.	1.3060442375981247
These costs are not very high.	0.9291894637898889
In the Member State where I come from, you are talking about 150 Guilders per car.	1.2773024754154034
If you charge this from day one, you can process the old cars straight away.	1.0429047808857694
A very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards, which used to be a common feature in our Member States, would then disappear.	1.396460746005413
I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise.	1.261655749363791
I think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible.	1.1099125225216542
This is positive because, in that way, the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto European roads will actually be processed appropriately, and this will benefit us all.	1.2877157210056676
Mr President, the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re-use and recycling of materials from scrapped cars.	1.1084760761029973
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers' liability.	1.3950063185114796
If we do reduce it, we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste.	1.1353942917005424
The common position, which was arrived at with great difficulty in the Council, which the Commission has endorsed and which was also maintained in Parliament' s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, complies fully with the environmental requirements. I therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendments from members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers' liability.	1.2267380629828137
If these amendments are adopted, I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues.	1.2127946699471548
So far, we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now, if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted, we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe.	1.4566111070631005
What is more, if we reduce manufacturers' liability on this issue, this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas, for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computers and other electronic equipment.	1.3218301917426687
I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers' liability.	1.1835582370680986
We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result.	1.1359494806251744
Mr President, this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars, encourage recycling, and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled.	1.1857105300325397
Now who should pay the costs?	0.7822109632426043
Whatever system is adopted, ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer.	1.0553408450464905
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars.	1.0975044933243632
The manufacturers have tricked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals.	0.856657086406582
Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers!	0.7440483222484049
If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments.	1.1674640549973627
Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is not a technical debate, contrary to what we may think.	1.3360247605496205
It has become eminently political.	0.7677672174758555
Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate.	0.8340657863591285
Today, if 314 Members of Parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers, we should be doing ourselves dishonour.	1.332486617324911
In expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicles, as Amendment No 38 stipulates, even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer, Parliament would, for the first time, not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of Europe, it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies.	1.292522330773476
We cannot accept this.	0.6462082375538541
It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas.	1.0864421789070713
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position, whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough.	1.3457677196260276
The free recovery system, for example, for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly.	1.108521490584743
Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council' s common position definitely must not be amended. It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable.	1.6461741731911488
Mr President, like so many others here today, I believe this is a good measure.	1.7434574043369158
This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need.	1.5473919223543926
Most of the technical issues have been resolved.	0.43853483150489203
There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved.	0.8730661107107259
We have arrived at the final question.	0.7031247014901363
In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament. That is quite simply: Who pays?	1.6101723675890007
The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost, not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said.	1.3952995184849786
In fact perhaps as little, the lawyers tell us, as 20% or one-fifth of the cost. That is not unreasonable.	1.4927284264061236
If you look at the UK consumer for example, who buys a Rover, as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars, over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should they pay?	1.2774039189273516
They have paid already.	0.48032630162160184
Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers, pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from?	1.0666556798763656
I cannot accept that.	0.6177745091444371
There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case.	1.1095374948724066
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it.	1.512632169402891
The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer.	0.8325819318276857
It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal.	1.368993378655359
The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government.	1.0744727650088366
The common position is a reasonable compromise.	1.3273360778113794
Some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road.	1.1853182260790143
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments.	1.208002889440372
Mr President, there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life cars, although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy.	1.4870021816566423
It is disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter.	0.9036267334350966
Firstly, Herr Trittin, the Environment Minister, was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet, then Chancellor Schröder blundered in like a bull in a china shop, having no expert knowledge of this process.	1.3418561401921103
Mind you, even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved.	1.4502693675519975
There are certain weaknesses, the greatest of which, in my opinion, is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses; after all, the car industry is more than just large companies.	1.551868687631046
It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises.	1.1911107361047395
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector.	0.936628702772358
The plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs.	1.047911586679022
The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint.	1.1025893992938187
It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position, I really must object, because quite simply, it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car, which contain a great deal of plastic, by means of rigid, high recycling quotas!	1.3695534544993975
Consequently, we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars.	1.3889483387772952
The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation.	1.3032908825468934
However, the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these.	1.333563848822441
Mr President, we are indeed now in a very rare situation: those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position.	1.4961787057926912
In contrast to what the previous speaker said, I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values.	1.3538011643580454
If we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs, we will be creating a loophole: we will not have created a rational, clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order.	1.3104914915727195
That is why, in my opinion, the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility.	1.1898134133515814
Only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem, taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future.	1.114959239712619
Mr President, there are two issues of principle in the Council' s draft directive.	1.426852191739242
The first concerns the manufacturer' s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles.	0.7497023552722001
There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade.	1.1591369798850741
This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles.	1.0301297161445429
I believe that, quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned, the EU' s directives should not treat small companies within the Union unfairly.	1.3621792412901172
Unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears, for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts.	1.2759662650963508
Yet the trade in used car parts is important, especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles.	1.0499271222649025
The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy.	1.1581555116781164
It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up.	1.3147141698701565
They should be able to establish themselves in new markets, but also to leave old markets.	1.2779447470842904
To bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development.	1.0302202283238764
The second principle in the Council' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive.	1.252192999815945
It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product.	0.9345904989439537
To do so also changes the owner' s liability retroactively.	1.111240274615765
Over the years, a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways.	1.0681880756879616
Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scrapping of cars.	0.8574470993299438
Some may be better than others, and some worse.	1.3278563377343462
In anticipation of this EU directive' s being implemented, EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation is not applied.	1.2274901848954305
This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds.	0.8951477260661803
Mr President, everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question.	1.3415388561346067
The common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement, and puts the whole directive at risk.	1.0786792309994857
I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument.	1.2627195854566358
I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive; the costs are not excessive: recycling a car costs less than 1% of the price of a new car.	1.143748768070012
Moreover, the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until 2006, when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market.	1.4430395233981121
As for the remaining vehicles, we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs, as is proposed in Amendments Nos 44 and 45 by Mr Lange, the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries, and we should therefore support them.	1.4719419638705298
Mr President, this is an extremely bad directive.	1.3829621882246736
First of all, as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out, it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle.	1.402101631959624
Secondly, it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment.	1.4112660676790614
In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment.	1.4082441466481905
I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect, which has not been examined well enough in this debate. It is like so much European legislation.	1.5031053233340033
It is far too prescriptive.	0.6843274941385328
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling.	0.6952629980122158
The production line was invented about a hundred years ago, I believe, by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles, to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them.	1.3099829174789428
One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars.	1.1492764221944765
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so.	1.211946790240989
There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars, recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts.	0.9056196984776855
This is a very environmentally reasonable approach.	1.17866912406568
It is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery.	0.896359475606184
This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the "dead" car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process.	1.0325622704677258
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive, it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally, and are certainly very damaging economically.	1.5610994862397218
Mr President, the common position is sound, but it is up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicles.	1.3374187309719696
The Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days.	0.9033855605877095
I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No 45, in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of disassembly and recycling at the door of the manufacturer, for new cars at any rate.	1.3531293030796383
Consequently, consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production.	1.3049953049718834
For the cars currently on the road, it would be reasonable to share the cost, for example by setting up a fund such as that in the Netherlands.	1.2650700399264743
The common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost, they should also take back end-of-life vehicles.	1.1712586922858832
This is a big problem in my opinion.	1.6691713652664903
I urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles, as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand components market.	1.1623842744943935
They would then determine their own prices.	0.7304247864927106
Anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur mechanic.	1.3881578878797827
The European consumer organisation, which has asked us to support the common position on this point, is to my mind letting the consumer down.	1.4352935026387048
A second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers' clutches is the cost of transport.	0.9836182362649941
If car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies, this will necessitate transporting end-of-life vehicles over long distances.	1.1255661142664761
This is environmentally unfriendly but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either.	0.8048267889577395
I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No 45.	1.1394388136869065
Mr President, Commissioner, I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate.	1.3276058753320839
If you travel to the Netherlands, you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free.	1.1310512890413873
You will also find that these cars are suitably disposed of, that new material flows have been opened up in order to recycle materials, that 85% of the weight of a car is recycled and that 92% of all cars in the Netherlands are recycled.	1.3614420735687054
This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes.	1.0772951449746944
Should this be condemned ecologically, Frau Breyer?	0.7686656364923012
I do not think so.	0.7520911288814713
The Netherlands has an exemplary model for disposing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or, in the case of end-of-life vehicles currently driving around, the manufacturer, has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with ecology; it is a simple question of competition!	1.3562380733056223
The issue here is whether a European manufacturer should pay EUR 250 million or a Korean manufacturer, say, EUR 2 million.	0.9794083243093372
In terms of the people who build cars here in Europe, I am in favour of not making competition unequal but, in terms of environmental protection, I want freedom from costs for the last owner, to be financed by a special fund, and manufacturer responsibility for new cars, which will force them to assume responsibility for building recyclable cars!	1.4458254247633466
(Applause from the PSE Group)	0.26895271987047414
Mr President, the proposal we are discussing has a huge amount of advantages, mainly in the interests of preventing waste and encouraging re-use, the recovery and recycling of components and the recovery of materials, etc. I think we have tabled a sound proposal.	1.331077230657369
The main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer, the vendor, or whoever, should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost.	1.3694039140348004
I will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system functions there without any problems.	1.1259596970522905
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved.	1.1660120691558082
These include car manufacturers, second-hand car dealers, the federation of the car industry, the metal processing firms, shredding firms and the government.	1.1161066640628396
An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis.	0.7933215322784832
The car industry - and Belgium produces a great many cars- did not have any problem with that.	1.3791817405349023
Belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost.	0.7657906331904158
In connection with this, we have noticed how - quite contrary to what has been said here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment - a number of small businesses have taken the recycling of materials to heart and are doing very well.	1.4289176250986817
Some businesses have become hi-tech businesses, because they managed to recycle certain materials, even materials which are not yet included in the directive.	1.2997349919970083
So this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain.	1.1251051557777656
I am in favour of collection free of charge.	0.5806407326892357
It worked for us.	0.47801317280293737
Why would it not work elsewhere?	0.7729030236252212
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented.	1.1667953049825073
Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes.	0.9279253445629755
Allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive.	0.8920301137194111
Allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate.	1.04254254855768
First of all, I think I should repeat some of the basic facts which Mr Florenz and others have already mentioned.	1.3854043350396326
What we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the European Union, resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste.	1.128475237598472
This means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars, and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open.	1.237320114684768
Moreover, they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind.	1.431258463900655
Approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars, but also cadmium, chromium, mercury and other very dangerous substances.	1.238010640475298
This is something you already know, but I would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening.	1.466938446236651
Cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in Europe.	0.9888760178469264
We know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it, and there is no excuse for not taking action.	1.284575447677119
The present directive has three aims. First of all, we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars.	1.1416298531711282
Secondly, we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable.	1.7263252223789596
We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product' s life-cycle. Instead, we should avoid creating so much waste.	1.212957564847014
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product.	1.2260144963280917
Thirdly, we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive.	1.393357115449381
These are the three most important aims of the directive.	1.147367499348622
This is, of course, because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled.	1.2313959163745227
It is, above all, the manufacturer' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car' s life-cycle.	1.0522373883921448
Two important questions have arisen in this regard. Yes, there are in fact more than two questions, but I want to mention just two of the most important.	1.4995623254205432
First of all: who should pay?	1.2400434012370818
And secondly: are we reducing the European car industry' s competitiveness by means of the present proposal?	1.2152598991951868
The first question, then, is about who should pay.	1.1774561552668845
The directive states that the polluter should pay and that the cost is to be borne mainly by the manufacturer in accordance with the principles to be found in the EU' s treaty concerning the manufacturer' s liability.	1.2196212609289765
It is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers.	1.2634554196209407
We have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car.	1.0803630588834339
Do we imagine, then, that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive?	1.4335445462693324
No. Clearly, we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment, but it will be very much greater.	1.557811086613003
Moreover, the cost will have to be borne in the future.	1.5502852826745601
The cost will not therefore disappear, but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed.	1.2913667733579368
Are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis?	0.9556327903496431
Is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it?	1.2000509673292152
Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these?	0.8763134102503641
Is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry?	1.1359477911920193
No, of course not.	1.5808835802507015
It is quite the opposite.	1.1308779542094558
Do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fuel-efficient cars is going to decline in the future?	0.9290575555123822
What kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars?	1.0910691987475891
Naturally, that they should be environmentally friendly, that they should be recyclable, that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment.	1.3761140516889987
It is, of course, only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry.	1.2659552728963939
We must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste, recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars.	1.1889031710275253
The fact that we have a European car industry which has already made great strides more than properly compensates for the fact that there are, in fact, a good many cars on European roads for which they must take responsibility.	1.390926412597948
The cost is not insurmountable; nor is the task an impossible one.	1.0483919884348702
If we develop motive power of the kind I have described, I am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload.	1.208273876864785
These will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems.	0.7902174686313144
The industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in Europe.	0.9847166751374952
They will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry.	1.0535313906264936
They will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient cars.	0.8733420616597651
We must do this for the sake of the environment.	1.196046251019991
The costs will not disappear. Nor will the waste disappear.	1.016272436312231
But, otherwise, we must all of us, as taxpayers or citizens, foot the bill. What is more, the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action.	1.306921948034144
That is what I should like to say by way of introduction.	1.365675229474761
I also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation.	1.1998811910447207
If we assume that, on average, a car has a life of eleven years, do Members, indeed does anyone, believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem?	1.3581436064215766
Do you think that, when we legislate about chemicals, we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future?	1.4538622867025948
Clearly, we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars.	1.3939003585859526
It is still not an insurmountable problem.	1.027058977359247
We can deal with it.	0.3053890538227184
We already have an infrastructure.	0.7634303890738954
We have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life cars.	0.9045083597796245
I naturally hope that the result of today' s vote will be a good one.	1.4210638082163451
If I have not already done so, I would also thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	1.1289833256552073
In fact, it is in many respects pioneering work when it comes to re-use and manufacturer' s liability.	1.3459214212998794
I believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment.	1.2348639187090846
We cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters.	1.0089675927152735
As I have said, we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues.	1.2137512213157529
After the first reading in the European Parliament in 1999, the Commission' s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the Council.	1.448112680957878
However, we obtained a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency.	1.2845113577702028
Now, we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully.	1.3439902412535694
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled.	0.9062679252223261
The Commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety.	1.2041966260839074
Three amendments can be partially approved, and one can be approved in principle.	1.1639692374337656
Certain amendments concern improvements to the Commission' s proposal which we adopted as early as at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such parts of the original proposal as the Council has removed.	1.2970408112389864
This applies to Amendment No 5, excluding section 1; 8 and 9, section 1; 10 and 12, section 3; 15, 16, 20, 22, 24 and 25.	1.0348614290775058
These amendments can all be approved.	0.7430208954712004
Amendments Nos 6 and 21 are new; the Commission can approve these.	1.3612145306539862
The Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial changes.	0.9585500954747611
I want to emphasise that a number of the other amendments affecting the proposal' s basic components involve a considerable watering-down of the level of environmental protection aimed at by the common position.	1.0456331474019032
They cannot therefore be approved.	0.43059796853831434
Parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in Europe.	0.8345990966880922
It would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today.	1.1263892706394105
I am very concerned about certain amendments from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question.	1.1680764685788272
These concern, for example, the phasing-out of heavy metals, manufacturer' s liability and the requirement for recycling.	0.9697499285558967
I want to deal with these amendments on a group-by-group basis.	1.1758085877293456
Amendments Nos 4, 11, 12, 13, 28, 30, 32, 37, 42 and 48 concern the phasing-out of heavy metals.	0.6451758582042656
Amendment No 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force.	0.9819809675309129
Amendments Nos 13, 28, 32, 37, 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions.	0.6778047417077638
This would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly.	0.9876160264296787
Amendments Nos 4, 11 and 30 mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling.	1.0940215135241473
The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view.	1.022853566503109
Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 34, 36, 38, 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer' s liability.	0.7019125057122912
The compromise reached by the Council is fair but fragile.	1.2141817545822486
The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without, at the same time, creating tensions.	1.06792942744086
I regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the Commission being wrongly used, so creating uncertainty about the Commission' s attitude to the issue.	1.3103291969552693
I want to emphasise that, as early as 1997, the Commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer' s liability and that the Commission entirely supports the common position.	1.5104965506728056
This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers. Far from it.	0.8097549666601251
Amendments Nos 39, 40, 46 and 47 concern quantified objectives.	0.7833421122020972
The high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed.	1.2509233833717601
These amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise.	0.9821250412395798
Allow me also - listen carefully to what I am saying now, because I have heard this reiterated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and "cherished" cars as mentioned in Amendments Nos 3, 7, and 9, section 2, and 35.	1.3207392144737626
Such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive.	0.8814630747870348
So, whatever has been stated in this regard, vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive.	1.060180719711062
We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive.	1.1816999003222246
Amendment No 23 involves the Commission' s having to adopt quality standards for reusable components.	0.9942192015583063
This is not covered by the directive.	1.1126636144997335
An ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the European Parliament and the Council.	1.0678481307340344
Amendments Nos 29, 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles.	0.9049610287146275
There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic, tyres and glass.	0.9749321354260277
Finally, the Commission cannot approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity; nor Amendment No 19, which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage.	1.4257069945779124
Furthermore, Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive' s area of applicability.	0.9981077544153152
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.47513528222732565
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
We shall now proceed to the vote.	0.16783221255831815
Vote	-0.0
Madam President, as you know, the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors, particularly in the French version.	1.2838023956026179
You have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which I have had dealings recently.	1.3465585675738787
There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4.	1.2951229192027707
In the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations.	0.8471048183848989
In the French version that becomes 'entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques' .	0.723274376130203
Could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises is not correct.	1.1539722225258773
It should not be in the amendment.	1.1126411831364933
And, again, I urge you, Madam President, to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently.	1.4960903134870183
Madame McNally, in general, I am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations.	1.4105505825415594
I shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution.	0.9431049485328882

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE	-0.0
McNally Report (A5-0082/1999)	0.9676599918426131
- (FR) I am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the Commission entitled 'Women and Science' .	1.044051978512315
In this document, the Commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in Europe.	1.2798876986009868
This objective deserves our total support.	0.5245024870283689
Expenditure on research and technology actually forms a sizeable part of the budget of the European Union, after agriculture and the Structural Funds.	1.1510396434732
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States.	0.9909221141567051
Relatively few women, however, are active in scientific disciplines despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies.	1.1767895478585124
It is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented.	1.0795201214552788
I am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the European Commission.	1.2760389494807916
The Commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at Community level, especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, which is quite obviously something I approve of.	1.2829215230472082
The goal for the years to come is to increase women' s participation to achieve a rate of 40% female participation in the Marie Curie grants, in consultative assemblies and in evaluation panels for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	1.089581790334902
In order to do so, it will be necessary to improve discussion and the sharing of experience among the various Member States, to set up a coordinating body to implement a 'Women and Science' monitoring system within the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, specially responsible for gathering and disseminating statistics collected in the implementation of the framework programme for research and technical development regarding the rate of women' s participation in research activities.	1.0975367184732863
Furthermore, like the rapporteur, I think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields.	1.3727475912409492
Improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles.	1.0120051687397098
We will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy.	1.0490710875676594
The European Parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	1.093381532644932
We must incorporate the gender factor in science, research and all other European Union policies, in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market.	1.038769007433297
In its communication "Women and Science" , the European Commission informs us of its good intentions of enlisting the support of women to enrich research in Europe.	1.3085587915293362
This is very good, and we are pleased to see it.	1.804462274525557
The fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the European Union.	1.032962344627211
We know that we can change this situation, in which women are underrepresented in the science sector, only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and, when they have obtained their degrees, by means of positive measures at the professional level.	1.3449553581452416
Having said this, some of our fellow Members clearly have qualms because the report by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipulating that there must be 40% female participating in research in Europe.	1.114856417096507
This is patently not the case, since such a quota would not be realistic.	1.2158563140722454
Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved.	0.9297994972673674
To set my fellow Members' minds at ease and to reassure them, I have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission, in its communication, undertakes to make significant efforts to increase women' s participation in Community research programmes, which is, after all, a praiseworthy goal.	1.2854068519020962
And why should we not note that the Commission' s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40% minimum level to be a crucial goal for women' s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes?	1.4433361412238965
It is not a quota!	1.1634089054823835
It is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission, insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of Member States.	1.1725012527770327
The latter would be well advised, however, to follow the good example of the Commission, for once, and make the same efforts in their own research programmes.	1.5086719683545868
People must realise this!	0.5249589068826997
I am pleased to see that the debate on Mrs McNally' s report with a view to increasing and facilitating women' s participation in professions in research and science, met with a fairly wide consensus.	1.1670597713789763
On this subject, any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable, and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women: to enjoy equal access to scientific study, to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence, and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly, enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career.	1.349293662200379
This necessary realistic and pragmatic policy, however, which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must, as far as we are concerned, necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity, which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject.	1.3002520116373066
Our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values, which truly respect gender differences, not on some postulated sexual equality, which has its own intrinsic contradictions. In any event there are no grounds for resorting to the easy option of a quantitative policy, based on the use of quotas, contrary to the idea of citizenship which the Members of Parliament in the UEN Group set great store by, and whose probable consequences would be the opposite of the effect apparently sought by Mrs McNally' s report, namely women' s participation in careers in science and research in proportion with their merit.	1.2821188453895043
By having the opportunity to show their true merit, by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women, and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege, women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish. In this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour.	1.3319558395406488
Since the European Parliament chose to vote on a text that expressly resorted to the quota policy which my report for an opinion had attempted to denounce in no uncertain terms, and in spite of the general approach which I approve for the most part, I can do no other than abstain from the vote on Mrs McNally' s report.	1.3860740056590173
Second reading of the Florenz report (A5-0006/2000)	0.6945061630528943
Madam President, today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the Directive on end-of-life vehicles.	1.2603047944073524
I have rejected the entire directive, not least because Amendment No 34 to Article 12 and the amendments to Article 5/4 have not received an adequate majority here in the House.	1.2666781304754717
I come from a country which manufactures 50% of the cars in the EU and it is precisely the free collection of end-of-life cars which is so financially onerous and unacceptable.	1.3561420894631704
Here, in my opinion, the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies.	1.0911811314757283
This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment.	1.2319079761202665
I consider that this is a serious defect and that, in principle, it does not befit our legal system.	1.3158358842340692
In my opinion, this directive is unacceptable for this reason.	1.4405052535956198
Madam President, I would like to comment on the Florenz report.	0.8743824954264543
I think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the Council has been toned down, the major groups here (and above all the German delegates of the major groups) have not, thank God, succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive, namely manufacturer responsibility.	1.6284244442004594
Unfortunately, there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy, i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years.	1.2015741713406232
We know that lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made.	0.9028929052381814
Here, unfortunately, the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry.	1.1659935353189945
I am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicles.	0.8580175165344662
I found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and I am pleased that it failed, that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large Member State did not gain a majority, by which I mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the European Parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries.	1.295107238859877
Madam President, although I too have spent most of my life in fast cars, I agree with my colleague, Mr Florenz, that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included.	1.4928926177556523
These splendid cars do not constitute waste.	0.689608800203213
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments.	1.1440381613510178
Neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country' s statutes to another' s.	1.0819468155867862
In this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations.	0.9934021526847913
We cannot forget old car enthusiasts either, of whom there are more than 50 000 in Finland alone.	1.3054514789901481
They are involved in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance.	0.7896069873988382
- (SV) The parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing, to say the least.	1.0887751205670995
Before the vote at the plenary sitting, new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the Committee.	1.3752734670294167
In the divided situation which has now arisen, we therefore consider that the Council' s wordings are the best.	1.3605321309132292
We need a directive in this area, and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure.	1.4399788410665049
The directive concerning end-of-life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation.	1.1231897594294085
It is therefore important that the manufacturer' s liability should be clear. This should not in any way be jeopardised.	1.4564504301054255
Today, Parliament is examining, for the last time, this text on 'end-of-life' vehicles and what is to be done with them: their destruction, a commendable intention with regard to our environment.	1.506482664206594
There are, however, two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text.	1.225859693464501
First of all, who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction?	1.3449405386001778
We must all ensure that it is not always the same person, i.e. the vehicle owner, who pays.	1.3875366961893187
He or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle, which is a bottomless pit in financial terms.	1.0490137364313086
We have recently had cause to talk about the 'polluter pays' principle. We should apply this principle rationally and calmly, correctly targeted and without ideology.	1.1832153459141623
Another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vintage vehicles from its scope.	1.0846314678533644
One might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point, but I feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts.	1.5161548732979249
So let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry.	1.0076925825924035
These old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe, if we are not to water down each of our specific identities.	1.2265240943603077
There is no lack of examples amongst European texts, and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision.	1.3152761984240406
I only need to mention the case of Directives 79/409 and 92/43.	1.038571343728147
The precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis.	1.1028742744057571
It is not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena. That would not be fulfilling our mission.	1.2562027330647412
On the contrary, we must adopt crystal-clear texts in order to limit legal disputes.	1.2183348189497714

(NL) That the Florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement.	1.182214696821481
I regret that the manufacturers have harangued the European Parliament and the Council with a whole ream of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false.	1.1799842011235975
I dare say this because I took the trouble to go into the field and collect information from, among others, scrapyards which already recycle car components successfully.	1.0162351151105344
They made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety, for example, are nonsense.	1.2683380530210262
The car lobby was unsuccessful today and I am pleased about that.	1.1881696879789139
The directive remains in place.	0.5050715721808493
I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirements.	1.2786220577889416
- My party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments.	1.0679422603858082
There are few things more certain in life than taxes, death and pollution.	0.8900610217109814
However, there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives.	1.2524517306870218
When it comes to pollution, like sin, we are all against it, but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good.	1.4027315222064802
In fact, this directive, like so many others addressing environmental issues, is not good.	1.4220035015891366
As is so often the case, it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem, which will only serve to create more jobs for officials, and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money.	1.322841328831724
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut.	1.3096433031835155
No one, not least my party, could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged, but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market, not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity.	1.6379179544321574
Thus, a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles, to encourage private sector recycling companies, through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements, and to incentivise the use of recycled materials.	1.271704154904972
Of course, these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction.	1.2780985741873507
However, in the absence of these powers, it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure.	1.4844669748702677
Instead, it should leave Member States to develop their own systems, and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good.	1.5964591490652662
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000)	0.4788321336440669
This proposal for a directive attempts to establish conditions for the posting of workers who are third-country nationals, for the provision of cross-border services.	1.1037516456080287
Third-country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one Member State do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the European Union.	0.9973739461897873
Until now, the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-Community workers have been very harsh.	1.14191306207644
It is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the European Union is being made easier, even when they are nationals of third countries.	1.4687005391042047
Nevertheless, the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another Member State when they are posted there by an employer based in their country of normal residence. This means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the Member State to which they were posted.	1.335460951366846
This means that this proposal' s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers, but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services.	1.4258024685288804
On the other hand, for the sake of simplifying procedures some highly debatable amendments have been included in the Berger report, one example of which is the establishment of a common information service for cards issued by a body in any Member State.	1.4022699690820213
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger Report (A5-0012/2000)	0.9693749503841101
It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services.	1.1066092120914912
Basically, these proposals introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States, a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits.	1.2751749301107504
The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there.	1.2270013000946456
According to the terms of the directive, the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned.	1.1743299263285327
Logically, in order to be given such a card, the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme.	1.511115757601016
The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals.	0.9384675052255478
While, basically, I subscribe to the European Commission proposals, nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion.	1.5011497684002835
That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.	1.011547097594236
This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading!	1.0244952863251784
Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures, for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards.	1.137041540056035
I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions.	1.142380298085561
I can, therefore, only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended. We could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union had to face so many problems.	1.3712216405408046
This goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union.	0.9044387127823698
Marinho Report (A5-0003/2000):	0.9693359230109824
We have serious reservations about the Council' s proposed amendments.	0.9470091698730942
How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is overstretched?	1.2379788577018873
The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter.	0.9300170460612653
Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim, but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them:	1.2772404647894937
On 1 January 1995, the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994.	1.3194487654921365
In May 1995, during the preparatory phase of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the CFI, concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases, was already insisting on the need to take measures 'without which the Court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role ... in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial.'	1.28491749007178
So what was done at Amsterdam?	0.7310406539722404
In that respect, nothing. On the contrary, extending the Community' s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden.	1.2538844621556777
You will agree, furthermore, that the texts adopted by this House always call for Community jurisdiction, and that includes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up.	1.3257911233600617
The increase in the number of CFI judges from 15 to 21 and the opportunity it has recently been accorded to have a single judge rule on specific cases are not real solutions but mere decoys, grudgingly granted, which we have become aware of after the fact.	1.0474168241610844
Consequently, these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake. They represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred.	1.408087738914254
We cannot agree to this, since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States.	1.152996433893419
The time has come, we feel, for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice.	1.5315023455383727
This question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity.	0.903535177791764
Is the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference not the ideal opportunity for this?	0.9960127478512238
Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen Report (A5-0018/2000)	0.6150411078472654
- (SV) The most important task of the approaching Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	0.9686434785981711
We therefore, of course, support the European Parliament' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.8792394795245906
We nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place.	0.9682737075539782
We also argued this in November 1999, and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999.	1.1723255533705934
.	-0.0
(FR) In the opinion which it has just adopted on the convening of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament calls for a "constitutional process to be launched" .	1.325007906759959
This determination to override nations with a legally supranational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is really a closet constitution.	1.147221344504729
It is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in Austria.	1.2057562027104993
The same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.1356029633214542
The key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modifying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority, of States and peoples, in order to increase the Commission' s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority States.	1.2526465719211524
Incidentally, the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission is asking for Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament.	1.3230703452732122
People will remember that this article, dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the Community level, stipulated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the Council and thereafter the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system.	1.2543835714977383
In France, both in the National Assembly and in the Senate, when this was being ratified, many members of the French parliament were reassured to hear that, in any case, the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making.	1.4398137155583597
Well, today, the same Minister of European Affairs who drew up the Treaty of Amsterdam, who has, in the meantime, become a European Commissioner, Mr Barnier, proposes to decide, at the forthcoming IGC, that the Council will operate in these areas by majority decision.	1.5076643395866116
This is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of European integration with the Brussels institutions.	1.0797135453936548
The French must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making, but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent.	1.2657132876769963
If they yield, they are lost.	1.023499644684929
For it is their very means of defence which are being eliminated one by one.	1.1870128840503382
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the report on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.867780567959974
It is crucial for us that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be concluded before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remaining formalities, such as the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers and the composition of the Commission and the European Parliament, which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the EU.	1.351506792740349
We were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December.	1.1850580282086585
An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process.	0.9933659209033127
That is something we do not want to see, and we have therefore voted against any such extension.	1.3352997622096472
We nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding.	1.2442129825364552
.	-0.0
(SV) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference.	1.3987480241628436
Possible future Member States ought to be involved in, and have an influence upon, the shaping of the EU of the future.	1.3658579402786915
The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centred upon Brussels.	1.1801155307778937
With the convening of the forthcoming IGC, the process of European Union is topical once again.	1.5223761193615915
Once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the Heads of State and Government.	0.8840426854239503
In other words, fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide, behind closed doors, on the fate of more than 350 million individuals.	1.155247537538398
It is therefore easy to understand the public' s lack of interest, given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them.	1.399683378488684
In fact, one only need look at the agenda of the IGC: the institutions, enlargement and European defence.	1.4257718775266153
The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power, the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe, particularly by increasing military budgets.	1.2466758123740644
Social Europe, used as a foil by the EU, has simply been eliminated from the agenda.	1.2470019773166368
All this does is to legitimise the development, on the European scale, of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers' main claims towards the highest common denominator.	1.169868166487625
This is why I am voting against the report.	0.982625216086304
I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the IGC. I did so because it sums up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency, which is supported by a broad majority in Parliament, of opening up the IGC agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between Member States, large and small, as was originally stated when the Helsinki Council was convened.	1.387532513670744
Unfortunately, in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for revisions to the Treaty on European Union, nothing has so far been stated about the need to review Article 7, which deals with suspending a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the "founding" principles of the Union, as laid down in Article 6.	1.3076272713727606
As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated, the Union has the right to protect itself.	1.401581332914635
Nevertheless, the legal mechanisms that exist in the Treaty are weak, difficult to apply politically and legally, do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance. Suspending a state is just such a process, and is to be condemned.	1.4195288593753395
I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda, and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the Treaties.	1.344737754873377
We feel that at present the central issues about convening an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda. They are also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulating proposals for new issues to be covered, and more important than the controversy over the extent of Parliament' s participation in it.	1.2951398829314047
We feel that these issues result from the IGC' s appropriateness and its objectives, as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there.	1.198678936606395
We have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged.	1.1296845097753012
This relates in particular to the intended agenda, particularly as regards the Amsterdam leftovers, which suggests that unacceptable inner cabinets will be created in the future. This also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars, which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union.	1.3254222409960694
These are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us.	1.1894066737200908
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report.	1.417963079032869
The text is overambitious, and Britain' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the "Amsterdam left-overs" in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these.	1.293604205204539
There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions.	1.3490098475171488
Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation.	1.2152435120572593
The key factor in this text as it has been amended, is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties.	1.2172484564493806
In our view, this would bring with it a complex legislative burden, and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are.	1.294050751004619
Our priorities (i.e. the "left-overs" ) must be:	1.157841529163508
the number and responsibilities of Commissioners	0.6981939914507521
weighting of votes in the Council	0.1606935492633165
extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe (but not Treaty change, defence matters, border controls or taxation), and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended	1.125781526107119
Beyond this, we have concerns that the "flexibility" or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present.	1.2083791271907376
The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation.	1.1657295048806129
- (SV) In order to be able to influence developments, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference than emerges from the present resolution, which displays far too much disappointment and negativity about the decision which the European Council made in Helsinki in December 1999.	1.362446746936881
The European Parliament and its Committee on Constitutional Affairs ought instead to have been more specific and concentrated on just a few points in addition to the Council decision in Helsinki, so stating what it considered to be the most pressing matters for discussion, including the question of establishing a public prosecutor to deal with crimes against the institutions of the European Union and their financial interests.	1.5016077649465522
We Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997.	1.2235328354165824
The most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	0.9244620037070296
I therefore, of course, support the European Parliament' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.8792458475986534
I nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place.	0.9925995553650778
I also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence.	0.8262754077843038
Joint resolution on Austria	0.5297753285293444
Madam President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group did not associate itself with the joint PPE/DE-PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria following the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservatives and Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party.	1.0834378393932953
This PPE/DE-PSE resolution commends the initiative taken by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott.	0.9371347647042103
What we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the Treaty, as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact, in this instance, have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples.	1.316458710473395
Whatever Jörg Haider' s verbal excesses, which we of course deplore, the Austrians have made a democratic choice, and we must respect this.	1.5321401193286162
In our opinion, it is clear that the left wing in the European Parliament, in association with the Austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena, have mounted a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period.	1.170208195825721
Although comparing Haider to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever, it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some PPE/DE Members of Parliament.	1.0793627615728527
But, going beyond this petty political operation, what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria, which caused political life to stagnate and rot, may soon spread to the European system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results.	1.3367810520668333
In order to prevent this threat to the system, it is ready to do anything, including overruling the outcome of free elections, including setting up a thought police, including establishing a new form of totalitarianism.	1.4729805874985096
Madam President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament who represent the Front national, the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento sociale italiano, I should like to ask the question: in this outrageous interference in internal Austrian affairs which the European Union has undertaken in contravention of general international law, in contravention of the Treaties, in contravention of morality, who is pulling the strings?	1.3973886643877804
Is this hysteria spontaneous?	0.44183963939822224
Is it the product of mere foolishness or, more probably, of a deliberate strategy, which is the same throughout the world?	1.5035753421533946
Who is imposing their will on the nations of Europe, daring to stop them choosing their own fate?	0.8602207676091193
Underground networks?	-0.0
The government of the United States, or of Israel?	1.4294319878576796
Or their Socialist back-up troops who, in this House, have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats?	1.18423865378432
What, then, are the values of these Socialists who feathered their electoral nest in the last century by painting the idea of greater social justice in glowing colours for the benefit of the underprivileged, and who today are nothing more than the party of protected civil servants, full-time union officials and state capitalism?	1.2755257474355683
What are the values of the Belgian Socialist Party, which only goes from paedophilia scandals to corruption scandals, via Vandam and Agusta?	1.1379295542009382
What are the values of the French Socialist Party, which extorted money from all the town councils under its thumb in the Urba, Sages and Graco scandals?	1.153575931354562
The party led by François Mitterrand, decorated with the emblem of Marshal Pétain' s Vichy government, the party whose leading lights have just been caught red-handed once again, living a life of luxury on the public funds embezzled from the students' mutual insurance company.	1.0007501972288526
I shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the Italian Socialist Party, because it does not do to kick a man when he is down, still less when he is dead and gone.	1.2404015443854424
I shall, however, mention the Spanish Socialist Party which has just formed an alliance with the butchers of Albacete and which settled its accounts with Basque nationalists by hiring contract killers.	1.0624480465964121
I shall also mention the German Socialist Party which dares to preach to us about the second world war, when it is international socialist in the way that its peers were National Socialists, still goose-stepping, the party of the Waffen SS...	1.186305151449673
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
Madam President, I had a major problem with this resolution.	1.4100045994964054
Finally, I abstained on the vote for a number of reasons.	1.3422301786602766
I was in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment, talking about rejecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia, racism, etc. and I felt that it might be misinterpreted.	1.2775299432759863
However, I do wonder about the wisdom of this.	1.4636510431320302
Firstly, there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequences of that.	1.1694986371777691
I also wonder about the wisdom of the EU and its reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there.	1.1464427002933402
At the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments.	1.126784098490206
Even America has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations.	0.9884799991428518
We wonder if this is actually feeding the flames of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it.	1.1250157186747578
I really think that people should be extremely cautious.	0.9208029912599953
If you want to combat xenophobia and racism, and I believe that we should, we need to look at the root causes.	1.3012425060070583
We need to look at the people who vote for these parties, and understand why this situation arises.	1.31767186536097
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want, but we need to be careful about the approach we take, so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.	1.5023263047797648
Madam President, I strongly refute any statement, demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism.	0.9819414614163634
I passionately defend Europe' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law.	0.8069649640073794
I disagree, however, for this very reason, with the senseless actions taken by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen States.	1.593067879442915
This is not the way to fight extremism.	1.22447359338649
It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good.	1.1748956022121155
The torrent of confusion and rash actions that has been unleashed over Austria has blown things out of all proportion. It has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and evokes risks that had previously not even been considered.	1.093374098302753
There is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law, but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the Austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law, in this case the standards laid down in the Treaties.	1.26841253502103
What are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an Intergovernmental Conference?	0.931480560172629
A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14, or even fewer?	1.3816480004961624
We support Europe, a Europe which does honour to all the actions that have brought us to this point, a Europe which respects the Treaties and the law and a Europe which needs Austria.	1.4369657469528476
This needs to be said!	0.7565873231242781
Madam President, I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has, by an enormous majority, condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider' s Freedom Party.	1.320222080338496
Mr Haider has demonstrated, over the past years by both words and deeds, that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse.	1.2315052018604387
Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler, praised the Waffen SS, and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma, but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government.	1.2187689285223493
He has led efforts to end provision for Austria' s Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrants.	0.9347989241551884
Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics.	1.245450570071252
They are wrong.	0.4848844779669157
European Union Treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights.	0.9115737896175864
Some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections.	1.3567833783413643
However, democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy.	1.5026411273293943
There is the tragic monument of the Holocaust, the death of 6 million Jews, to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s.	1.302785130919127
However, we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition.	1.4367256752123148
Leopards do not change their spots.	0.8211326745655556
The real culprits are Austria' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945.	0.8739432798549168
Madam President, we have just passed a resolution which condemns the racist and xenophobic record of Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party in Austria, which has welcomed action by our governments to cut off political relations with any government of which he is part, and which sends our support to anti-racist groups within the democratic majority of the Austrian people.	1.4045203289395052
We warn that this coalition, if it is formed today, unacceptably legitimises the extreme right, directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation, which bring us together in this European Union.	1.260209002783375
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us.	1.1951087933300417
This European Parliament requires the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria, and threatens to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happens.	1.4313034787075367
I am proud to support such a resolution.	0.7325976376449322
Though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today, I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be taken.	1.4157844607699732
I shall take the floor very briefly, Madam President.	0.9915992860603865
I respect Parliament' s wish, as it has been expressed, but I must also say that the self-determination of peoples cannot be called into question, even by the European Parliament.	1.5797243241795145
The document is unfair both to Austrian Members of the European Parliament, and to members of the Austrian national parliament, and it smacks slightly of jealousy and political interests, but also of business.	1.5513203508267943
I do not believe that these signals will change the citizens' indifference to Europe.	1.1918444239634187
The Austrian extreme right has been gifted an unwarranted present.	0.7329498324978914
I very much welcome the position taken by the Italian Radicals; and I say this while making a clear historic and material distinction between Italian liberals and Austrian liberals.	1.134954238639018
I have for many years, in word and deed, been committed to the anti-fascist struggle and the struggles for equal rights and against xenophobia. However, recent events - firstly, what were really threats by the Council of Ministers, then Mr Prodi' s threats against the Austrian Commissioner and, finally, the present decision - are things I cannot support.	1.4033718186217683
I have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of its premises. What we have here, first and foremost, is an incredibly ominous mixture of power, arrogance and impotence on the part of the European Union.	1.2788175231641525
Not only do these decisions conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are entitled but, worst of all, their effect will be counter-productive.	1.3658379655584556
They will not weaken Mr Haider and the FPÖ. On the contrary, they will strengthen them.	1.3558482640695648
We shall obtain the very opposite of what we want.	1.1936758443706987
That is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right.	1.101158277392461
. (DA) The Left' s Members of the European Parliament attach importance to the fact that, with today' s decision, Parliament has NOT supported the fourteen prime ministers' diplomatic sanctions against Austria.	1.2601419353973646
The Left' s Members of Parliament therefore supported the Liberal decision' s powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in Austria or elsewhere.	0.9935153707937001
We attach crucial importance to applying, if necessary, the new provisions under Article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty so that a country which, by its actions, infringes fundamental citizens' rights by means of discrimination and such like will have its voting rights in the EU' s Council of Ministers removed.	1.359974048825082
- (EL) The Freedom Party' s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union' s political future.	1.311298426476163
It is a 'Trojan horse' which is unfortunately reappearing in Europe larger than ever since the Second World War.	1.049693671509562
The European Parliament and the Union' s governments must politically isolate a government that includes admirers of Nazism and advocates of xenophobia.	1.169653879448609
The European Union bears a large measure of responsibility - and along with it the two dominant political movements, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats - because, by their dogmatic adherence to the harsh financial policies of EMU, their dislocation of the welfare state and their deification of uncontrolled competition, they have pushed broad strata of society to the limits and made it possible for right-wing extremists of the Haider type to recruit support for their neo-Nazi ways.	1.2964450678468566
	-0.0
In view of the fact that the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condemning Haider' s party, as well as all the parties throughout Europe which disseminate racist slander and which are xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers, we voted in favour of the compromise resolution. We did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms, in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who are opposing the Austrian extreme right and its demagoguery.	1.3901145224317943
Our vote in no way constitutes an endorsement of the signatories to this compromise resolution, their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious.	1.1151640916487142
Some of these parties, despite declaring themselves to be republican and democratic, adopt the demagoguery of the extreme right, either out of connivance or as a vote-winning ploy, if only in openly and hypocritically blaming the immigrant workers in our countries for unemployment, and generally making their lives more difficult.	1.208465697062281
More generally, those signatories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various States of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy, devoted exclusively to the interests of big business, has not included taking action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it engenders, and has thus facilitated the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right.	1.2369284238647027
This week we heard the first political cry of the new-born Europe.	1.1086474466070964
By staunchly and speedily denouncing the participation of Jörg Haider' s xenophobic and anti-European party in the Austrian government, a situation without precedent since the second world war, the European Union has come into its political birthright and has confirmed that it is not merely an economic and financial Community, a large market, a "Europe of shopkeepers" .	1.3516771544997312
It is a part of its future which is at stake right now, part of its very essence, its heart and soul.	1.4247662417627833
The European Parliament was the first to speak up.	1.5564929466848287
The appeal by the European Socialists, on the initiative of Olivier Duhamel, raised awareness and enabled there to be a firm and immediate political response to this unheard of and intolerable situation.	1.196692589842679
A firm attitude which the 14 European States have demonstrated unanimously and promptly, through Mr Guterres, by condemning the risk of the Austrian political situation getting out of control.	1.2555285845861714
This courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe.	0.7029536870048457
A return to the roots, at last, for a Community built on the basis of the determination to turn our backs on a past history marred by hatred and exclusion and of adherence to the humanist values of openness and tolerance.	1.1483913942641952
Europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events.	0.8161258465535106
However, as it lacks the legal instruments to support this political will, since the sanctions stipulated under Article 7 of the Treaties are virtually impossible to apply, will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of its entire institutional structure?	1.4216646160052628
The whole credibility of Europe is at stake today, before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow.	1.2399634051214112
From now on Europe must put its words into action if it wishes to show the world the scope of its rediscovered ambition.	1.1132218553317834
At this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo-Nazis in the government of a European Union Member State, I must express my regrets regarding a compromise text which is particularly lacking in backbone.	1.300251048345093
I am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the European Parliament, after its excellent political debate yesterday, should not adopt a stance on this matter.	1.119218745448174
Personally, however, I shall continue to fight against the extreme right, to urge people to sign a petition to demand measures which may go as far as the exclusion of Austria, and to organise a major public demonstration in Lille on Saturday at 3 p.m.	1.2850468584499544
Fascism and neo-Nazism are cancers!	0.5384259147232872
The foul monster has been reawakened!	0.5816265072640847
For me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might.	1.11013834020935
Europe was born out of a desire for peace, freedom and tolerance.	1.0054530497195198
There is no question of it allowing xenophobic, racist and anti-Semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it.	0.9656573564455588
Do not count on me to keep quiet, without doing or saying anything.	1.0788345015936367
In yesterday' s debate in the European Parliament some Members of this Parliament expressed worry that we were interfering in the internal affairs of a Member State.	1.3495246474428735
Such a concern is misplaced.	0.6277483391049494
The European Parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in Member States with which they disagree.	1.2944664696133
We have condemned Basque and Irish terrorism.	0.5817409632499737
We have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities.	0.8393391861944596
It is our responsibility as a parliament, particularly as the democratically elected voice of the European Union, to comment on current political developments in Austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament.	1.433800855034487
By commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in Austria from forming a coalition government.	1.1148240153124735
We are nonetheless, as is our right as well as our responsibility, telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand.	1.3641865862999771
Others would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement.	1.0371987653889392
Such a view is not only a political cop-out, it is positively dangerous.	1.2624669460879836
In reaching an agreement with Jörg Haider and his party, the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stroke be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching pad for even greater electoral success.	1.1291591554418223
That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria.	1.3426978585857945
- (SV) We have voted in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who are exposed to xenophobia and racism.	1.1167091344359639
We have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that Jörg Haider stands for.	0.9817763783973118
We are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the 14 Member States have employed on this issue.	1.0808330917773112
The resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the Member States' national identities and constitutional traditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty.	1.1708898858415806
What is also missing is a paragraph concerning the EU' s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in Europe and Austria which have been among the prior conditions for Mr Haider' s electoral success.	1.168791481710128
Today, as previously in the history of Europe, right-wing extremism is the result of insecure social and economic conditions of life.	1.283818213335049
The policy of cut-backs which has followed in the wake of adjusting to EMU has promoted the successes of right-wing extremism.	0.83842847578938
A radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in Europe.	1.334617286071232
- (DE) I am making this statement on behalf of the CSU.	1.4545650536541055
It is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State.	1.014517905996528
It has no right to do so.	0.7531373682327818
Instead of prematurely condemning the FPÖ and the Austrian Government which is being formed, there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition.	1.2208983795505124
Only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe.	1.2471487092309939
This does not mean that we sympathise with Haider.	0.7742929483788366
The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ.	1.0505301788374586
However, as politicians we must ask the question why 27% of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FPÖ at the elections in October 1999.	1.4712777653553832
We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results.	1.103464884886103
Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FPÖ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics.	0.8617951794875632
However, the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem.	1.3582756463177916
For these reasons the CSU European delegates are against this resolution.	0.8736149539609922
"He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen-chests; that it bides its time in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, and bookshelves; and that perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city."	1.238844167523741
It is with these phrases that Albert Camus, at the close of the long allegorical novel describing the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of Oran against the plague, reminds us, at the close of the Second World War, that the fight against Nazism, "the brown plague" as it was termed at the time, could not enjoy a definitive victory.	1.2621417804820318
That because racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear and rejection of what is different, have deep roots in all that is basest in humanity, they may re-emerge at any moment and take over any group of human beings.	1.1731916842699028
In this light, the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic.	1.090824242519001
For the first time since the Second World War, a party which is openly pro-Nazi, racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a European country.	1.0975432800225777
Confronted with this threat, which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe, nothing must deter us: not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit, not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene, not the derisory respect for formal democracy, and, above all, not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control.	1.3198313484306627
As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of Réunion, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exupéry, "In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!"	1.2111532847754523
This human diversity is our main sources of wealth, and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it, wherever it may exist.	1.1972623311140047
For all these reasons I voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria.	1.1139904886154623
Jörg Haider' s rise to power, with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FPÖ coalition government, is a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth.	1.153761136231357
The success of the Austrian Freedom Party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter, whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism.	1.1811382701529325
The resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of Fascism.	0.9662647671836049
It can be explained by the feeling of helplessness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further.	1.0508704830281559
In order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an apprentice dictator who is nostalgic for the Third Reich, we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrians opposed to Fascism.	1.2260263656786388
This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a 'European democratic model' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks downs, expels and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers, when it is not opening files on teenagers.	1.2263029491068096
- (DE) I have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government being formed between the ÖVP and the FPÖ.	1.3985412087206541
I consider the casting of Jörg Haider as "Europe's scapegoat" (or even worse, neo-Nazi and Super Racist) to be counterproductive.	1.2524988831071293
Of course I, in no way, agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime.	1.1467737081948783
However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider's adherents.	1.3041392082276235
The EU must not do him an invaluable PR service.	0.8859684502037658
The strength of the FPÖ can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility.	1.2555696867320314
It was only after they unsuccessfully solicited the FPÖ to tolerate a minority government and, obviously in vain, offered the Freedom Party ministerial posts, that the SPÖ begin its massive campaign against Haider.	1.1276027518959224
It turned its threatened loss of power into an "heroic battle for the preservation of values" and an imminent, pure-and-simple "decision between democracy and non-democracy" .	1.0016305823894762
This is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which I cannot condone.	1.1102408238518726
We German Christian Democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly disassociated ourselves from them.	0.7869256151224484
We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-minority.	0.8429450745824103
Today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments.	0.8572700383331101
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again.	0.9187905156330414
It cannot be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions.	0.9620344471136233
The ÖVP (Austrian People's Party), whose presence at European level we have also come to take for granted, is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria.	1.2916312721713834
It can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles.	0.9040397320043968
The Council has become prematurely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government.	1.1706472968055193
This condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the Austrian Republic.	0.8975367686112412
Sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye.	0.8057276894681166
We must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left.	1.087309634917121
I would have liked to see the same outrage in Europe when the socialists were prepared to make common cause with the successors to the misanthropic and persecutory regime in the DDR.	1.038691514523326
In the meantime, they have been forming governments in German federal states.	1.1927410890464287
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today's session.	0.9532472617489687
He spoke of the task of not isolating Member States but of doing everything to unite them in common European values.	1.1096231332429214
- (FR) I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Austria.	1.261732064594673
Austria is a free, independent and sovereign country.	1.0243514853883102
Consequently, neither the Council, the Commission nor the European Parliament has the right to interfere in the internal administration of a Member State.	1.559692740508184
The Austrian elections were held in a free, proper and democratic manner.	1.0058496374717183
Any interference by the European institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable; it is in violation of the European Treaty (Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam).	1.6081181104668107
Nevertheless, these same institutions showed no reluctance to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union, despite its well-known human rights violations.	1.1881568566214378
Nothing of this nature has yet occurred in Austria.	0.7512846650036117
This precedent, created on the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency, is a worrying one as far as the future of the European Union is concerned.	1.4206871267972196
On the one hand, the political excommunication of Austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of conformist thought. On the other hand, if tomorrow the governments of European Union Member States must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational bodies, then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed.	1.2711044109546958
In such circumstances will it even be worth having elections?	0.8852884396842788
This is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future.	1.3321501377081304
- (FR) The vote which has just taken place in this Chamber is a historic one for it is the first time we have ever debated the internal political situation of one of our Member States with such anxiety.	1.422099576280061
I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated.	1.0308290812502978
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union.	1.4542423161911147
I urge the Commission to be less cautious.	1.3034970511681543
In this resolution, Parliament is assuming its responsibilities.	0.9509528171972422
Having said that, in my opinion, the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum, the very least we could do.	1.3154886131255665
Personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line, and I supported Amendments Nos 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group.	1.2883921438714614
In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party.	1.290737202383191
Including Jörg Haider' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe, and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries.	1.2113618061530433
The Austrian People' s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this.	0.9732772190085878
It is our fundamental values which are at stake here. As the democratically elected representatives of the European people, we have no choice.	1.7650878072170275
We must reject what is unacceptable, as our constituents demand.	1.2407528051005985
Because, when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces, failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation.	0.9929641215347559
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution.	0.7254254431203437
I condemn Jörg Haider' s racist and xenophobic policy.	0.7645871916343776
However, I cannot accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State.	1.3386827993102715
I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution, and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution, even though it would be a vote against the extreme right.	1.3082624314214244
- (SV) Obviously, the political leaders of Europe have a right and a duty to react against Mr Haider and his party.	1.238818393833963
The political leaders of Europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another Member State, just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority.	1.0640996223182706
Finland' s experience, however, is that integration, rather than isolation, is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces.	1.4047832168509937
I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution, which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights.	1.047705778207036
The EU Presidency' s "common reaction" against the formation of the government in Austria is legally unjustified.	1.0128401982791646
The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States.	0.797793510653682
Nor should we isolate the forces in Austria which wish to work for human rights.	1.027687505565842
Despite these objections of mine to the Council' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactics, it was important to show clearly where the European Parliament stands on questions of racism, which is why I voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote.	1.3922806185039909
That concludes the vote.	0.7371881423092536
Adjournment of the session	0.1175009033114339
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	0.9014895913403758
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)	0.6235589366903199
Resumption of the session	0.13474910339249976
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 3 February 2000.	0.8761015948008776
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting	0.454925075991522
The Minutes of the sitting on Thursday 3 February have been distributed.	0.8753414842521424
Are there any comments?	0.1337831580886173
I can see from your reaction that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Minutes and clearly you cannot approve Minutes which you have not seen.	1.261542844987804
I therefore propose to submit the Minutes for your approval tomorrow morning, since obviously you do not have them and I must apologise for this.	1.37820591652738
I shall therefore postpone the approval of the Minutes.	1.1247314389082266
Madam President, on a point of order.	0.937014339380419
The BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House, holding a senior position within his delegation, continues to offer strategic advice to private clients, but does not state in the Register of Interests who these clients are.	1.0884735730214103
The people of Europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit, but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible.	1.3592617014734987
Madam President, since these matters are currently being considered by the Quaestors, may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and, above all, to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House, but is also published on the Internet?	1.4247472529711487
Thank you, Mr Davies.	1.1813252923150441
I shall look into this matter with the College of Quaestors.	0.8558177237189845
Madam President, on a point of order.	0.937014339380419
As this is the first Valentine' s Day of the new millennium I hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this House to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease, the biggest killer in the European Union.	1.3798688525327636
I would urge Members to sign up to the commitment made today at the Winning Hearts Conference that every child born in the new millennium has the right to live until the age of at least 65 without suffering from avoidable cardiovascular disease.	1.0838775692226685
Happy Valentine' s Day!	0.7477216373090482
Madam President, I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and allude to the same point raised by Mr Davies about the very serious allegations made on BBC radio this morning.	1.3017942487948315
I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two Members who were named in this particular BBC interview are not running their companies from this Parliament or from parliamentary offices, because that would be a very serious matter indeed.	1.3790378929766245
In the past the British Conservatives' double standards have brought the United Kingdom' s House of Commons into disrepute, and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this Parliament.	1.3575710210582133
Thank you, Mr Murphy.	1.1382035277489015
As I informed Mr Davies, I promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors.	1.1955699120915273
Madam President, on a point of order.	0.937014339380419
I have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the House.	1.1400876430156386
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking.	1.0329689897714591
Why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC?	1.1161851905498543
Is this House going to let its agenda be determined by scurrilous reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies, or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing Europe?	1.1077176502950719
Gentlemen, obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be basing their assessment just on information from radio programmes.	1.2860367769716892
They will look into the matter thoroughly.	0.839155456348902
Madam President, I believe I am expressing the feeling of a great number of Members of Parliament in most of the political groups when I say that the message which the President of the Commission sent to the new Austrian Chancellor a week ago created some unease.	1.4687333597855434
Was it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his best wishes for success, or to say, "I am sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment as shown by your predecessors to liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms" , or indeed that he awaited productive and constructive cooperation?	1.1940696747031707
This is why, Madam President, I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words, so that nobody, absolutely nobody, can use this message, which is unusual and unwise, to say the least, to contribute, and that includes counter to the intentions of Mr Prodi, towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in Austria a commonplace.	1.4277264303915282
Thank you, Mr Wurtz.	1.1813252923150441
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, not to start a debate at this point. This was just a procedural motion.	1.382385936091183
Let me remind you, Mr Wurtz, that we shall be seeing Mr Prodi tomorrow. He is going to make a statement on the Commission' s programme.	1.5458839369075743
Naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement, just as Mr Prodi will be perfectly free to answer you.	1.0825554228779624
I suggest that you clarify this matter at that time, if you so wish and if Mr Prodi agrees.	1.2297712921190627
Madam President, it is with great regret that I have to trouble you yet again with an issue that I have raised here twice before.	1.4739830154006326
I have already told you on a number of occasions that we, on behalf of the Dutch contingency, would like a Dutch television channel.	1.3591502985628259
There are now 28 channels here in this Parliament, including two Greek, one Portuguese, one Finnish and one Belgian, but still no Dutch, and as many as seven English, six German and six French.	1.5415120950827532
I was promised back in September that there would be a Dutch channel by January.	0.9652325478196568
It is now February and we are still waiting.	1.4753406471263266
I would ask you once again to work on this.	1.2048075633528375
I wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a Dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite.	0.8202841909866612
Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, let me say how disappointed I am, because I personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago.	1.1540631414649254
I have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti has an answer for you.	1.2204114694299228
I shall therefore, with your permission, give the floor to Mrs Banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion.	1.3302924277594774
Madam President, as my dear friend Elly will know, I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleagues happy.	1.4836409560848598
I would like to assure you as quaestor in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio, and I have already started mailing colleagues in this connection.	1.43816442341662
If it is of any comfort to her, the Irish have not got their channel yet either.	1.2793047168579608
There seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it.	0.9637230812830377
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this.	0.8409003959813145
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel.	1.22357060016142
I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can receive their own national channel.	1.2339622460023256
Thank you, Mrs Banotti, and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this.	1.3496721518149732
Madam President, I should like to tell Mr Wurtz that the Commission' s doctrine is not the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty and that, until proved otherwise, we are not in the situation where Articles 6 and 7 would be applicable.	1.4088601607115796
Austria, therefore, is perfectly entitled to form its government and the President of the Commission is perfectly entitled, and even duty bound, to offer Austria his best wishes.	1.488353724274456
Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party, the French Communist mayors, were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France.	1.1661685841374416
Agenda	-0.0
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	0.7727796318260651
a) Sittings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Relating to Wednesday:	0.7890430645296043
President.	-0.0
In view of the fact that no Council representative is able to attend on Wednesday evening, a number of groups - the Group of the European People' s Party, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left - requested that the Council statement on the Cyprus question and Mr Brok' s report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta were dealt with during the joint debate and that these two items plus Mr Swoboda' s report were brought forward in the agenda.	1.08033189971026
This would then give us, for Wednesday' s sitting, the two Council statements on the coherence of Union policies with development policy and on the UN 'Human Rights' sitting, followed by the joint debate on Cyprus and then the reports by Mr Swoboda, Mr Corrie, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Knörr Borràs.	1.3619291059717678
Is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal?	0.8281926376044294
Since no one wishes to speak, I shall put this proposal to the vote.	1.4389569635206199
(Parliament gave its assent)Relating to Thursday:	0.6549794917503831
President. I have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	1.0715776082154385
On the subject of human rights, I have received two proposals for additions: one from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party for an item entitled 'Cambodia' and the other from the Group of the Greens, for an item entitled 'Pinochet' .	1.1709566884433698
As you know, we can only include five items in the 'Human Rights' section.	1.2247984102552862
According to the list given in the final version of the agenda, there are already four items.	1.318029771475795
We can therefore table only one additional item.	0.8667297015293965
Who wishes to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to propose the addition of an item on Cambodia?	0.7637271500531703
Madam President, it is remarkable that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet, despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued.	1.289682743066863
Since the Belgian Government' s appeal to a higher court was declared admissible last week and since the decision has essentially not yet been taken, it is important for Parliament to at last give out a strong message, a message which should signify that nobody can escape a just trial.	1.2495836665132511
It is inconceivable that the European Parliament, which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights, should fail to adopt a clear stance on this.	1.174677492742553
Madam President, this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time.	1.2557779981022164
Firstly, the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet, but, furthermore, there are certain questions to be borne in mind.	1.4350402867415648
The first is that this matter is sub judice in several European countries, and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system.	1.2678595176094343
We are in favour of the International Criminal Court, but it does not yet exist.	1.4729291160030453
Secondly, there is currently a democratically elected government in Chile, led by Ricardo Núñez, whose first declaration was that all those who have committed this type of crime must face justice, and I would remind you that the Chilean justice system, which is independent, is currently examining 60 complaints lodged against General Pinochet, concerning his crimes against humanity.	1.3577640362950636
I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up, but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure.	1.3050900593435013
We believe that justice should be done in this case, but this is not the most appropriate procedure.	1.5331371806144332
(Parliament rejected the proposal) President.	0.6141349771211897
We now come to the third proposal which is for 'Environmental disasters in the waters of the Danube' , a proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.	1.1701463127437415
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	0.5671976341025808
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what has occurred in a tributary of the Danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the Chernobyl disaster.	1.2346944706180902
It affects not only Romania, but also Yugoslavia and, in fact, the entire Danube basin.	1.4621095504099977
We consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to react swiftly to this situation, and I think that Parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject.	1.434717940596513
(Parliament gave its assent) President.	0.5452223449231448
Still relating to Thursday' s sitting, the PPE Group has requested that Mrs Cederschiöld' s report on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to Wednesday as the last item on the agenda.	1.071622019205459
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal?	0.8087856492917832
Madam President, the agenda has been rearranged so many times that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal.	1.4582436146065427
It is not a very time-consuming matter, but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delays.	1.3883444499094078
It is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting, which is an extremely urgent matter.	1.5118481746382864
We have tried to drive this proposal through.	0.6758123301721546
I should therefore be very grateful indeed if the Chamber could support it.	1.1043737603650132
(Parliament gave its assent)	0.06492846330865369
Relating to Friday: President.	0.5762183745591377
Relating to Friday, on Friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the Group of the Party of European Socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in Brussels, as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda.	1.3050889888676942
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal?	0.7809087196985277
Madam President, with apologies to my friend, Enrique Barón Crespo, I should like to speak against this proposal.	1.4074537837044623
I am surprised it has even been made, because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the Conference of Presidents.	1.1562252171309837
I think that your proposal, Madam President, to keep the debate and the vote separate, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date, is a reasonable one.	1.394562227282926
The reason is as follows: this issue concerns no less than 1 800 000 employees within the European Union.	1.1723939854103498
We already have a directive.	0.744381453132703
It is not an old one, it was issued in 1997.	1.5905924073555886
Deciding upon future policy lines, with a view to a new directive, rather hastily, without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners, I feel, runs counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators.	1.332755578531166
I propose, therefore, that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date.	1.0739769478344083
Madam President, I clearly owe Mr Wurtz an explanation, and I am going give this explanation before the whole House.	1.3335637560566236
We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents.	0.9197253409807231
At the time, I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter.	1.185504334895705
My group has debated this matter and considers that, given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area, it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement, regardless of any action it may take in the future, so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week' s debate.	1.3913143567716095
Madam President, I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this is about.	1.556137712764298
It has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance; it is just about the following question: when will the Commission - having already had a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive?	1.3185056250181308
Our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to, and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible.	1.1274974104917714
That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats' request to hold the vote on Friday.	1.4967575345506365
(Parliament gave its assent)	0.06492846330865369
Madam President, as you know the Cederschiöld report has been taken off Thursday' s agenda. That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday.	1.5321912884439561
Since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate, in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half, I simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time.	1.3503253950748357
In general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic.	1.2603661744440944
Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-and-a-half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote.	1.0773760885388515
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda.	0.9186909200035396
That is absolutely absurd.	0.5004835409786162
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed.	1.3142909863335033
This sounds perfectly feasible. We shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour, considering the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschiöld' s report.	1.285359565371114
This is all I am talking about here, just that.	1.4138679782693477
Madam President, I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday, which you have not yet announced.	1.4774167858856075
I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration, on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March, so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way.	1.3772026565992272
I understand that there is agreement on this issue.	0.986942137291668
Madam President, this afternoon, in this Chamber, reference was made to a series of reports on the BBC Today programme this morning, which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow misusing their position as Members of this House.	1.2724559094972707
These are serious allegations.	0.6594921317879752
They are completely untrue, malicious, politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood.	0.9437641920245209

Sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative	1.0330549678268808
. (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners and members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was given the task of drawing up the European Parliament' s report on the Community Initiative Programme INTERREG III.	1.1352674180850293
Upon referral to committee, we examined over a hundred amendments and, so far, 17 amendments, some of which have already been presented in committee, have once again been tabled.	1.4173275868222435
Before discussing the content of the resolution, I should like to inform you of the elements which I took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur.	1.1603288955077582
First of all, I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative, founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation.	0.9942208084530113
This programme constitutes a driving force for development on the European scale.	0.963504747038533
INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-2006, and is the one with the largest budget for implementation, i.e. EUR 4.875 billion as opposed to EUR 3.604 billion at the present time.	1.072809527333082
The INTERREG initiative, created in 1990, is built upon the wish to make the regions of Europe ready for a 'Europe without frontiers' in the context of establishing the great single market.	1.2577425179776998
At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996, the INTERREG CIP has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution networks.	1.2000987902996831
These programmes promoted cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area.	1.050899684637213
The INTERREG III programme, for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the European Commission, pursuant to the terms of European Community Regulation No 1260 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, continues these measures.	1.1197083490617061
It is based on three strands. strand A organises cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions, at both internal and external borders of the European Union, on the basis of joint cross-border development strategies which Member States' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing. strand B governs transnational cooperation between national, regional and local authorities in various Member States or applicant countries regarding regional development, transport networks and the environment.	1.3234883237298867
Member States, i.e. national authorities, are responsible for implementing this strand. Finally, strand C organises interregional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries to exchange experience under strands A and B and cooperate in the fields of research and technological development, subject to consultation with the European Commission which is responsible for its implementation.	1.3299912332646926
The new INTERREG programme, in the form in which we have received it, takes into consideration the needs engendered by enlargement to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and to island regions and most remote regions.	1.391645467255137
The Commission proposes redistributing the INTERREG funding as follows: between 50 and 80% for strand A, 6% for strand C, and the remainder for strand B, i.e. from 14 up to a maximum of 44%.	1.2928808586354164
The European Commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand A and strand B. It bases its assessment principally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period.	1.0334393863305251
The most remote regions may benefit from support under strand B. The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand A is not comprehensive, but is comprehensive for strand B. The Commission reserves the option to, at a later date, put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions, for strand C.	1.3333469625113912
The adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds.	1.1002491951340179
Proposals are drawn up by Member States and are submitted for approval to the European Commission, which checks their conformity with the general guidelines, adopted.	1.455239379976764
These proposals must include a number of elements, an overview of the cross-border or transnational priorities and strategies, a description of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan.	1.2581111296616354
I belong to the great majority of Members of Parliament who voted in favour of continuing the INTERREG Community Initiative Programme. I regret that Parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme, which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency, but I acknowledge that this was not an easy operation.	1.449521092511565
I also regret the fact that we had an extremely short period to work in, as the text was examined in parliamentary committee on 24 November last year and then on 26 January. I further regret the fact that neither the regions, nor the representative regional organisations were involved in framing the programme.	1.3509325700640065
In promoting cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation, this cross-disciplinary instrument is the very incarnation of a regional policy on the European scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the Community territory.	1.2224305442169627
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential in order to maintain the existence and continued development of agriculture, to provide farmers with an environment containing the necessary infrastructure and services, and to ensure greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life, diversification and job creation.	1.1716587471777535
An integrated development policy for all rural areas in the European Union is therefore needed, consisting of the following elements: an integrated, multi-sectoral approach, simplification of administrative procedures, improvement of the partnership between European institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment.	1.2063225960842805
In its 1998 policy paper, Agenda 2000, the Commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based: the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas.	1.2580148750029643
The first principle means creating a new 'pact' between farmers and society, making the farmer 'steward of the countryside' and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside' s recreation value.	1.1310595270083157
The second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector, so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented. In this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the CAP.	1.2982577692227457
The LEADER Community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs.	0.9872298860126052
The following objectives were set: improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas.	0.9419577908785922
LEADER I applied to the rural areas covered by Structural Fund Objectives 1 and 5b, and 217 local action groups participated in it, with financing of EUR 1 155 million.	1.174340955809657
LEADER II (1994-1999), for which a total evaluation has, unfortunately, not yet been completed, had a wider scope than LEADER I: there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated, after reallocation of resources, probably amounted to over EUR 4 000 million.	1.39198765235881
In October 1999, following the success of LEADER I and LEADER II, the Commission decided to extend the initiative.	1.14855440931054
For the 2000-2006 period provision has been made, unfortunately, only for a total contribution of EUR 2 020 million, and an indicative allocation for each Member State has been set.	1.3395340281591201
LEADER+ differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible. It is also more ambitious, and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet.	1.4082630622711398
The main changes are as follows: all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from LEADER+; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes, such as the use of information technology, improving the quality of life, and adding value to local products.	1.1631237548879274
I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because, as I was saying, it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious, even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population densities.	1.385772676289353
I believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the Union and I repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence, such as the Carrefours.	1.3228739137456047
I share the Commission' s preference for the use of global grants while urging, however, that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and painstakingly defined.	1.1632172453717693
I regret the delay with which LEADER, as was the case with the other three initiatives, was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure.	1.3315499067829235
Finally, I am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated, if you consider, in addition, that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the Union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous LEADER II.	1.7032137822785711
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation, and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments.	1.3754550308791071
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative, whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	1.1962635570924
The report was a major undertaking because it also incorporates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.	1.0115810114835122
This Community initiative succeeds the two forerunner programmes ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT and has a much smaller budget of around EUR 2.8 billion.	0.9374778778910303
The initiative adopts a completely new approach, which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships.	1.0828240786049552
The intention is clear: targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level, projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities.	1.0696791212956978
This objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this House.	1.2802713876920253
In addition, EQUAL should feed into the National Action Plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these Action Plans.	1.2373446576034843
It is an important Community initiative which, together with the three other initiatives, URBAN, LEADER and INTERREG, is financed out of the Structural Funds.	1.3349146556580698
In my report I have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships.	1.1389641959003596
I consider technical support to be necessary but, given the problems with the former TAOs, no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level.	1.3524389929760843
Nevertheless, technical assistance is necessary.	1.3113045282497109
Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice, with special emphasis on mainstreaming.	1.0499580745348138
I have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report.	0.9422286967264787
This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises.	1.3030535708448618
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers.	0.8348236464514337
However, in this context, Madam President, to allow us to work out the details, I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday.	1.3686880438776998
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the European Parliament, because Parliament put the appropriations for EQUAL in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that Members' ideas were also reflected in this Community initiative.	1.3840026645591446
In this connection, the European Parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in Parliament.	1.1830248677079709
EQUAL should live up to its name, and this is my firm intention.	1.2483987932065577
It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union.	1.0535319704607926
It should prevent society from splintering.	0.6839997386222719
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life.	0.8082995781745407
Everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age, gender or origin.	1.0383344536914307
That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support!	1.5409445838049702
Madam President, it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here!	1.5517205308887745
Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative.	0.9972206075317359
Yet we as politicians knew that there was a groundswell of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000.	1.0361640189531292
Parliament, therefore, can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn.	1.4125716943452968
Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy.	0.7732684369894237
In my Member State, for example, we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities.	1.2237776034815102
With eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas, it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation, social exclusion, joblessness, crime, drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that.	1.2355078551450205
For example, in my own region, in Manchester, the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success.	1.656616201789319
URBAN funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK, in Moss Side.	1.225148164725233
The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community.	1.1340273373751162
The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs.	1.0243752790007212
This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity.	1.3211462480392013
As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative, they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity.	1.0869127672915417
We agree that they ought to be indicative in nature, allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes.	1.0886170998084268
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50.	1.282449853824732
We are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 is not the key factor.	1.2185750903599228
Instead, we should go for good-quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal, to attract inward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect.	1.2144041742682052
The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations.	1.3260845448332803
In the designation of local URBAN programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas.	1.1270673760368186
In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes.	1.0812633858318537
This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria.	1.235381578083902
I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that.	1.123105152182954
Our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems: high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment, poverty and social exclusion.	0.9829033324091426
Often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency.	0.8347431634442575
We therefore have unstable communities which are infiltrated with crime, drug-dealing and gangs.	0.9023056328454204
This is all too familiar in many of our urban areas.	1.3120506510223726
All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents, yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity.	1.3340353535484777
That is why again, in my report, I have asked that action under the URBAN Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem: these areas do not have single, "mono" problems.	1.5286771397682146
Instead, communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems, using EU resources as a value added to local actions.	1.13619705222859
I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination, as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty.	1.2598116830404713
The Community initiative means community involvement.	0.9004962553027627
Some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents.	1.1058844272771453
We need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes.	1.0839489796691468
The time-scale therefore proposed by the Commission is very ambitious.	1.3970929883608463
It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation.	1.0105327634792873
The Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice.	1.2726277639960344
This is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks.	1.1342163551282514
Finally, I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-industrial city we require local participation.	1.2147575372072632
We need to deploy the energies of the unemployed, the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems.	1.08140447033393
We shall thereby be able to replace poverty, dependency and alienation with equity, initiative and participation.	0.8879121859891426
This will help us to restore the credibility of the EU and the confidence of citizens that Europe can deliver local action to solve local problems.	1.2359507682311288
. (IT) Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, has already pointed out, we can certainly consider URBAN a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations.	1.435716180432947
As we have heard, the objective of URBAN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas, bearing in mind that 80% of the population of Europe lives in cities.	1.203712151254836
Creating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long-term job creation, action to combat poverty, measures to assist low-income groups and old people, facilities for children, racial and ethnic integration, better opportunities for participation, a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measures.	1.1778771039975595
The Communication from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic, social, and infrastructural measures.	1.0689928277337022
However, we must remember that, in addition to URBAN, a number of other Community instruments are also available in the social sector: innovative actions under Article 6 of the ESF regulation, pilot projects, particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the European Parliament under the 2000 budget and the EQUAL and INTERREG initiatives and mainstream ESF activities.	1.3371890654599616
As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its opinion, the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding.	1.3323410746816307
While, on the one hand, we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary, we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved.	1.4206980895171373
Not only is this coordination essential but, as we stated in our opinion, exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential.	1.1881460534859245
Mr President, the importance of this initiative is increasing constantly as economic and social problems in Europe' s cities intensify and the public feels more and more out of touch with the administration of its city or neighbourhood.	1.1881655277682597
That situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from European Union enlargement, and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities.	1.3316611622874455
Addressing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities' historical and cultural role.	1.1542519853911741
However, in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis.	1.4188541047659091
Here, we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women, and the agencies that represent them, in planning and implementing the URBAN initiative programmes.	1.5213996694199208
As the Committee on Equal Opportunities, we also stress the need to finance infrastructures that will facilitate professional activity by women, mainly by harmonising their professional and family commitments, and more generally infrastructures that promote solidarity between the generations, social solidarity.	1.4098210020818527
Effective implementation of this initiative could have a cumulative result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local levels, thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of European policy in their day-to-day life in real terms.	1.2317511010007252
Mr President, our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention.	1.3484354473722706
In committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban areas to go hand-in-hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities and therefore for measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programmes to be funded by URBAN.	1.363096997873184
We considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration.	1.038433458803674
Our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole array of measures including the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning, action to prevent juvenile delinquency, the reintegration of offenders, and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved, for example the police, the courts and social services.	1.247941487526395
We adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue URBAN - which in the past has been implemented successfully - because, as we see it, programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the European Union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the European Union enjoy peaceful coexistence.	1.5402251346936462
For this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind.	1.1473264930080591
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives, INTERREG III.	1.2027395806285595
It must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under INTERREG III.	0.9885820765858697
In the light of the fact that 50% of unemployment in the Union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions - I need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration - this is not only reasonable but imperative.	1.362379594647599
The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect.	0.8715263670194165
In reality, however, the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects.	1.3097845294707273
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures, especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment.	1.1205405167585445
Employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand B, especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre-accession strategy.	1.0644333761271263
In general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis - because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstract and therefore proving disappointing.	1.2814031530590402
The fact that administrative expenditure on INTERREG III is - in my opinion - still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise, although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the Commission' s support programmes.	1.432679881721232
However, I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal. It is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the EU is once again given the importance which it deserves.	1.4961659007250512
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism considered, amongst other things, the report on LEADER+ and, as a result, agreed to support the process of decentralisation in the management of actions, believing that that process could be effective on two conditions: that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community, and that Commission control mechanisms are utilised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using LEADER+ resources to support civil groups and organisations which are related to those authorities.	1.2172854551574483
We ask for a guarantee that the decision-making bodies for the projects are represented equally by three elements: political representatives and public administrations, companies and economic operators, and social operators, including unions and non-governmental organisations.	1.220074357934667
We would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies.	1.2563920448260355
We would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development, whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself, and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes, included in Objectives 1 and 2, and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located.	1.3471481272474817
We are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LEADER+, but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate Community resources in the less-favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union, and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion.	1.379386274574777
The Committee believes that projects financed under action 1 should place value on the potential of endogenous development, in particular based on local traditions, techniques and practices, on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy.	1.218930880676298
The Committee supports the Commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that, given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations, the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants.	1.2405520530724836
We believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3, financed by LEADER, with those of other actions financed by other Community programmes relating to interregional and international cooperation and partnership, such as INTERREG, SAPAR, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA, in the same areas.	1.2038021238691483
Mr President, Mrs Stenzel, ladies and gentlemen, before addressing the EQUAL report itself, I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based.	1.3654119790155712
The basic objectives of an EU-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability, entrepreneurship and adaptability.	1.1735417805851027
These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy.	0.9651766916983681
However, the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people' s self-determination.	1.326540255380448
Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives.	0.9519622228432205
Mrs Stenzel' s report has, however, turned out very well, at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned.	1.38908238384654
All asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes, although this should be self-evident.	1.2396981363349167
Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against this in the committee.	1.0469338564933492
I would ask them the following questions: does your policy seek to marginalise people?	1.1080297398088523
What is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so?	1.1850551662791904
Does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability?	0.8480004954702315
It is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme, because there remains a shortcoming in the report.	1.4157099421470396
Particular emphasis is given to the point that women' s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more crèches should be built.	1.1991193376421876
Anyone who lets men happily climb the career ladder and worries only about childcare places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming!	1.0700356833947042
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention.	1.0078099410149597
I am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.	1.3587552407237304
This cross-group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions, which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy, transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	1.1674150946149393
The members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the Commission proposal which they would criticise: firstly, for example, the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities; secondly, the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the Commission and thirdly, the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance bodies.	1.3343294984716814
That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure.	1.4237869943462966
The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments.	0.7554341982230787
We attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector, in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium-sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change.	1.30890985585188
Dovetailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the EQUAL programme.	1.2729938416973334
We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme.	1.001665543090267
The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators.	1.061345661674053
This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it.	1.5970731070183872
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time.	1.0254340584024253
However, criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee.	1.544139772175659
The reports are late, and, in addition, they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	1.2227880753068563
A good opportunity to discuss the results, good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost.	1.0583239734465146
Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union.	1.0551642255640719
Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region, but, in my opinion, we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either.	1.3029459849945175
Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA and PHARE programmes.	1.1923828953261377
This coordination is at present lacking, and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it.	1.3855548387687089
We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible.	1.1184952277865379
It is of decisive importance to get local business, organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes.	1.060116221758762
Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful.	0.9632650869385484
Projects have often remained half-finished, and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy.	1.1158676190416383
We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement.	1.0251527317266098
Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee.	1.1555631299725506
I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the explanatory statements, has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission' s guidelines.	1.5473747655760746
It will not work as an automatic target, but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions.	1.330206771349117
This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn.	1.0520095549169108
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds.	1.2275931374741977
Here, projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries.	1.207977860032058
Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money, that is only for the borders within the EU.	1.4157854691157845
But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation.	1.1291158383996451
The regulation pretends that there is one, but there is not.	1.5575407435330788
The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time.	1.3795865492811166
The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded.	1.0092469876379784
Since 1996, Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties.	1.2305116965748435
Nothing has happened!	0.3405212239429186
The difficulties are once again being allowed to persist, to the detriment of the regions concerned.	1.2209508070412085
Parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation, and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners.	1.2896206586681114
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers!	1.435377033242785
Mr President, a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes.	1.2426277018076841
According to my group, this is excellent if, as a result of this, deprivation within regions, towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved.	1.2237518881635643
That is a question of solidarity and progress.	1.1476137776493174
But dishing out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending.	0.9236121706385735
The local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience.	0.8158644356466088
They find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes.	1.1031518787001198
Anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly, but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval.	1.0553078477576694
Since there is great uncertainty surrounding the way in which rules are interpreted, local councils and regions have now started to enlist the services of expensive bureaux. The task of these experts is to gauge to what extent European Commission officials would be prepared to approve plans.	1.1551448282917798
In some cases, I get the impression that it is not about solidarity or alleviating the most desperate problems, but about propaganda and upholding vested interests in exchange for the European Union' s blessing.	1.3674773329076753
It seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co-financed by the European Union.	1.126664397133868
Too much money is wasted on propaganda and investigation bureaux, consultation and control, and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place.	1.2420496381716606
After the planned accession of new Member States with their 100 million inhabitants, the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current EU Member States, this squandering will generate even more protest.	1.3097360137123222
In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Confederal Group of the European United Left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Nogueira Román, on LEADER.	1.256212499215045
He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas.	1.236791288318733
If there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas, we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality.	1.2053001245774595
After all, innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without European funding.	1.0882125134620695
A second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils.	1.1616674377855467
The emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities, non-profit-making organisations and profit-making companies join forces.	1.043943500752297
The discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied.	0.8235639477549519
In this respect, one of the variants considered is reminiscent of the Dutch polder model, the structurally planned cooperation between government, trade unions and employers' organisations.	1.1403320530542471
Let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population.	1.0211478831651564
So, really, these bodies should already provide for a balance, and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process.	1.369795915245891
My group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play, as their input in society is important in our view.	1.3607182258114747
This could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short-sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start.	1.049301017536502
But the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that, unfortunately, democracy is not fully functioning yet.	1.4032022971784184
One of the objections is that, due to the restricted role of the elected bodies, businesses gain more influence.	1.1168721299174365
As long as the economy does not weigh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few, it is questionable as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local councils.	1.2365360996906267
We believe in 'one man, one vote' more than 'one share, one vote' .	1.1904104561343254
Mr President, there are economic frontiers within the European Union, and the internal market with the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is fully operating at this time.	1.2486688543607205
But for the internal market to work effectively and for the single European currency to be a success it is important that all regions within Europe, of which there are over 100, can economically compete within this very challenging environment.	1.479069134212106
Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita.	1.074521368997441
There are poor regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the European Union structure.	1.3111711038607394
That is why, when we look at the EU Financial Perspective between 1989 and 1993, and 1994 and 1999, we find such a large proportion of the EU budget was put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund.	1.392876307772865
There are twin problems that still remain for many regions in Europe: firstly, the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road, water treatment facilities and related transport networks; secondly, the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long-term unemployment, which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of Europe.	1.1165870188146707
There must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a Europe of the cities alone.	1.2204239358037174
We need to ensure that job creation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural parts of Europe as well.	1.3261186640214133
The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes, namely, the new INTERREG III initiative, EQUAL and the LEADER+ scheme.	1.3434223188328673
Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross-border development, combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes.	1.3608594414682742
Mr President, quite a few towns and cities within the European Union have to contend with deprivation.	1.386470822246891
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately.	1.1065515738599534
This is why it is useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and, if necessary, give additional support under URBAN.	1.4609969166317653
Over the next seven years, the Commission' s proposals concerning URBAN will entail a reduction in both the Community budget and the number of areas standing to benefit.	1.3140693662471186
In common with Mrs McCarthy, I have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced.	1.328316048965464
It is desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget.	1.2149635634733877
As far as the budget is concerned, as already stated, URBAN is there to support and complement national policy.	1.378719124010617
In order to generate extra means if necessary, I think it is entirely logical to turn first to the Member States and private investors.	1.3024118087760552
Consequently, we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens, as borne out in the committee meeting.	1.717112185534746
In addition, I am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood, especially where Community contributions are concerned, should incentivise.	1.4324508107277485
Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence.	0.7908338810118742
We would then be overreaching ourselves.	0.8173919476707674
I would like to finish off by making a general comment on INTERREG.	0.996207775645056
In my opinion, funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions.	1.0372127926533523
When projects are implemented, it is also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation.	1.1336415597595808
According to the report issued by the Court of Auditors on the year 1998, this is not an imagined risk.	1.3964015397885141
Hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects.	1.0968522980476958
Before I begin I will take the liberty of expressing my consternation at the way in which Austria has been prejudged by 14 Council representatives.	1.0122971441566524
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiatives are being pruned to a total of four.	1.1681749884670047
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accorded.	1.160151854831219
However, the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems.	1.435490811948243
The regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines, although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds.	1.2043150543485768
There is no direct transition between INTERREG II and III, the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding.	1.2183644159192646
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects.	0.965888378239746
When INTERREG is implemented, it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned.	1.164045170284137
This is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed.	1.1606058529561731
However, problems will arise in particular from the fact that under PHARE, for example, funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project-related, whereas INTERREG funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures-related basis.	1.2613614963424848
This will cause practical problems in the future, and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTERREG effectively.	1.2850966400671595
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community initiative LEADER proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas.	1.1193456756619389
The preservation of this Community initiative in particular, in the form of a new version - LEADER+ - is therefore greatly to be welcomed.	1.4792327760220985
The new LEADER+ programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union, which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects.	1.124837761052327
It is important for there to be coordination between LEADER+ and the other support initiatives in the European Union, but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important.	1.2804035459198764
Overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects.	1.083728719237896
In this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under LEADER is very welcome.	1.0967043138330248
Agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative.	1.3951791222978334
In the same way, through the LEADER initiative, structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas.	1.1058312637987056
Attention must be paid in the LEADER+ programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result.	1.1530475201423633
LEADER must now move into the implementation phase.	0.8485495698768799
The operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission, which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible.	1.2867695795512435
Five months are provided for this.	0.6589826834758764
That seems to me to be rather too long.	0.9349555849863428
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times.	1.0127324401725475
Because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible.	0.9689088734161324
Despite all the delight over the reworking of this Community initiative LEADER+, I do still have one further concern.	1.2153237288864576
In its proposal the Commission called for an observatory for the LEADER+ programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented.	1.0287598026234839
For me this raises the following questions: who will work there?	1.033825340565846
How will these people be selected?	0.6201009844913059
Where, above all, will the required money come from, and where should this observatory be located?	1.2760334360738657
I do think, though, that the LEADER+ programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks, which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case.	1.399183902185154
In addition, experience from other fields where observatories have been set up shows that, apart from rather dubiously creating jobs, they are not of any great benefit.	1.2036292431228695
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that LEADER+ programmes run smoothly.	1.1934958731441956
Assessment and publication are part of this, and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past.	1.2257709931855605
Mr President, the majority of the borders, which have divided Europe for centuries, were artificially created, separating single geographic spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion.	1.236136596460749
Our internal borders, or what remains of them, no longer cause wars, but they do continue to generate economic backwardness, social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of Europe.	1.264133738266083
The Community' s institutions are obliged to work towards overcoming these border scars, which contradict the spirit of European unity.	1.2222121176058938
The economic and social cohesion which we propose is based, by means of the INTERREG initiative, on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent.	1.266486258710174
INTERREG has always been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory.	1.1176875379192264
Although the European Parliament supports this initiative, our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of INTERREG II.	1.558019724251901
However, we are aware that we must not delay this third version further, since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway. The success of INTERREG is clear and that is the opinion of the local, regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects.	1.4510498770177718
The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together, of innovation, of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each other.	1.2609080136444337
There are many interesting questions relating to it, the monitoring centre, the principle of concentration etc. However, I would like to concentrate on the management bodies.	1.2904526096032847
We must create joint, interregional and transnational management bodies, in which all local and regional authorities, as well as economic and social operators, play an active role.	1.3265915705816957
There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border.	1.021910222274841
We must create a cross-border culture, and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation, imaginatively overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each Member State, in each region and each municipality.	1.3070202736074994
A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication.	1.2186503154383024
During debates in committee, we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instruments, such as MEDA, TACIS or PHARE.	1.2266024053850568
This Parliament' s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties, making proposals capable of solving them to the Commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes.	1.2279478384732498
Mr President, my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative, in Ireland in particular, has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area.	1.6392768235687554
It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage.	1.5256920852392009
Even in Member States and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos, in situations where there are inadequate facilities, where schooling is very poor, where the physical infrastructure is under-developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife.	1.2683073212239004
It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and their families.	1.5106554691090823
The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland, as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries.	1.3463129193054506
It was quite slow in getting off the ground there, but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes.	1.3630078797501863
It is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative.	1.2049766303473812
It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme.	1.1158338182357226
I should like to make one further point before I conclude: we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious URBAN development policy.	1.3758020055036857
This, unfortunately, is not the case in Ireland.	1.637997844112113
I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market.	1.0480612785985735
The development partnerships are a very clever idea, even though they are experimental.	1.2065422874444134
I have two major concerns, however, about the development partnerships.	1.5203098932780648
They should be accessible to smaller groups, accessible for them to be able to devise, implement and monitor the programmes.	0.9290990820642484
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme.	1.0134922562486897
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon, so that it becomes accessible to everyone.	1.2270499231134513
I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report, but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all.	1.171705219473931
My second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems, for example, disabled people' s access to the workplace.	1.0259464581764917
Projects should also specifically address this problem.	0.7435161112382495
These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes.	0.809392675820309
I certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the West Midlands.	1.0885683725415012
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees.	0.706456608652478
Although I am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with repatriation, having access to EQUAL, I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugees.	1.257055656834474
It is only fair and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way as everyone else.	1.174983779902177
Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, with the LEADER report, rural development is very much to the fore.	1.4883459838887954
This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying, especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union' s rural development policy.	1.2463485340660738
It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning, but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as, for example, areas experiencing depopulation.	1.2250813852184863
It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme, local operators have combined forces, debated and prepared projects.	1.0749665862536986
These programmes have, therefore, been important channels for participative democracy, the rationale of the citizen for Europe.	1.3176582686267093
So, the concept for LEADER+ should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes.	1.2354061932139961
One urgent question is therefore raised: why, when this programme has been successfully run for ten years, is LEADER+ still classed as experimental?	1.3052839488286243
Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful?	0.9135361116504859
For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development?	1.176328038595753
Moreover, I wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the Commission wishes to restrict LEADER+.	1.4227671350076663
At a time when, Commissioner, after Seattle, we Europeans are fighting on the grounds of multifunctionality in rural development projects, why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient?	1.28135420919117
As an ecologist, let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approaches.	1.14373745623409
In this connection, the Commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries.	1.12692655693887
A better solution would be, as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism suggests, strengthened coordination between LEADER+ and the Community cooperation and partnership programmes, such as INTERREG, PHARE, SAPARD or MEDA.	1.0689094878210716
The fact is, showing solidarity with Eastern Europe, is all very well, but it is not enough.	1.279204106884687
The tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south, particularly the countries around the Mediterranean, must not be abandoned.	1.264693096823075
Therefore, once more, we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision. Codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type, which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application.	1.4684506268181885
Mr President, I have a few very brief comments.	1.3042231597901175
We are debating the planning phase and guidelines for the four Community initiatives without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period. This is not very good at all.	1.3466158628649039
Programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory, while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud.	1.1207917217689394
The Community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain preconditions.	1.1948480576431302
They must, however, not be subordinated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy, but must develop their own self-sufficient role.	1.5051196783285266
For example, adapting EQUAL to the objectives of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations transforms this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts.	1.0223267326382433
Extending the LEADER initiative to every area in the Union entails the risk of marginalising deprived areas even more, to the benefit of more developed areas.	1.2358350796247026
The INTERREG initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas, islands and both mountain and non-mountain areas, such as the prefecture of Arta in Greece, whose omission from Annex I of the Commission' s communication is ill-considered.	1.0495781657461434
Mr President, rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area, and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible, Commissioner Fischler.	1.6428736182655275
Our response to rural decline has come late in the day, but I suppose better late than never.	1.100361754471466
Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed, certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000.	1.2264835613688776
In my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms.	1.3447696350301366
It behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival.	1.0500464922674044
As the Commissioner knows, farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities.	1.0639853009371791
For this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development.	1.1575097502682474
In this regard LEADER has established itself as an effective development initiative.	1.0954293863300884
It provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems.	1.0049424438100953
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated.	1.3503374001673474
Yet, through LEADER, there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy.	1.2320599819802283
In conclusion, while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER+, I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme.	1.414143983339974
I urge you to look seriously at this problem.	0.7971451911363564
A break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers.	0.9602030147305438
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having read the Commission communication on the INTERREG III initiative, and pointing out that I took part in the vote on Mr Decourrière' s report within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and, particularly in the context of INTERREG III B, with the Commission' s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of landscapes run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector, a sector in which many associations, especially cynegetic, are already making enormous investments in my own country.	1.2673594372876849
I should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand A of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand III C and, finally, in requesting that Members of the European Parliament should be involved in the European Observatory for cross-border, transregional and interregional cooperation.	1.2724317035217085
I should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which, in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B, involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000, which I think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems, from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted.	1.3277938577911528
Finally, if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit, I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the INTERREG projects and, beyond that, of similar initiatives.	1.5014654380602266
It would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of framing and implementing the programmes concerned, otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens.	1.3651136167294378
Mr President, first of all, I would like thank the rapporteur of the EQUAL report, Mrs Stenzel, very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us.	1.4137977819901153
EQUAL is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light, doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds.	1.1842843793929754
This is an arduous task.	1.1226890496565525
Only, the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped.	1.3932803278974428
This is why it is so hard to strike a balance, not only between the different countries or the different components, but especially between the different groups listed in the programme, and in fact this is what has preoccupied us to date.	1.4979025539047637
Comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another.	1.0901126531403542
I, for my part, have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme, and I have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the European Parliament devoting special attention to them.	1.3816804979833217
Although a few other groups have been mentioned, it is the Member States, in particular, which are on the lookout.	1.4365230969103966
For example, I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component, namely refugees.	1.5931772174190173
I would, therefore, ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups.	1.1601896052413962
It should not be the case that one Member State, under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle, can decide that all funding should go to one group.	1.2152720005837727
I think that this will have to be monitored closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which Mr Meijer has warned us so vehemently, to wit, that vested interests will emerge and that people will think that the money is theirs to spend.	1.3469819416914641
This is not the case!	0.9955072918633622
It has to be redistributed time and again.	0.6990917666841111
It should be used for innovative projects and it should not completely disappear into the Finance Minister' s treasury funds.	1.2993265603933952
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here.	1.659232875925298
I believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this Parliament, and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance, can be solved.	1.4036426754614113
As far as the Commission is concerned, I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this Parliament, mainly with a view to reaching a balance.	1.4669826136070296
I would just like to underline this - the situation is, of course, a little precarious - Parliament has, for the sake of convenience and safety, placed the EQUAL programme on the back burner for the time being, so that Parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed.	1.4361688880834096
I believe that this is actually a good thing.	1.2761744729432902
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear.	1.0866512218593158
The Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful.	1.174095842758002
Mr President, there is no doubt that the INTERREG initiative promotes efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union.	1.2096420047732837
However, I should like to stress INTERREG' s particular importance for the Balkan area, where political developments and hostilities over the past few years have had major economic repercussions for neighbouring countries and especially for my own country, Greece, which is the only Member State on that long-suffering peninsula.	1.3233209355943225
For Greece, for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria, but also for Europe as a whole, the social and economic restoration of the Balkans, bringing political stability, is a vitally important matter.	1.4259630748572514
So far, some Balkan countries have received aid from the PHARE and Obnova programmes, while others have not.	1.1958094560311627
During the new programme period, in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations, such as ISPA and Sapard, it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of INTERREG with other financial aid to third countries.	1.329415454413971
Accordingly, we welcome the related references in Chapter 7 of the European Commission' s proposed general guidelines for INTERREG.	1.4642076200687557
The efforts to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programmes equally, and I say that because in the MEDA programme during the last period some problems arose which have to be overcome, so that we can have equal treatment for all the third countries participating in that programme.	1.3312884215823482
I should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter-state cooperation zones has taken no account of the Mediterranean' s geographical peculiarities, which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island regions.	1.416336552832112
We therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review.	1.0355711283838023
I end by stressing the need for the European Union to persist with such initiatives, which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions, and to foster their harmonious development.	1.4676506587470186
And since this is St. Valentine' s day, as a former Mayor of a regional city, I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love.	1.4657587363284927
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles: preservation of jobs, stewardship of the countryside and, not least, local culture, because that is of the utmost importance.	1.3888348502317904
Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured.	1.1741496055364011
We can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the Alps and they are devastating.	1.0389520785174555
But I warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside.	0.7824068749815967
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore.	0.9463873500007278
To really guarantee sustainability - a buzzword which has, since it gained new currency, become relatively devoid of meaning, but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed, amongst other things, is an integrated approach in the countryside towards, for example, tourism and agriculture.	1.3963176272363018
The investment needs to be visionary.	0.6815027711711746
Young, creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside. If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more.	1.2237907751933603
None of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate, all-round distribution, and the pilot projects need to act, as it were, like avalanches and trigger other similar projects.	1.2662044385594364
I would be in favour of supporting self-contained cycles of projects and, even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have had shortcomings here and there, overall they were certainly positive.	1.1930353721420193
I should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountainous areas - the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada, from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density.	1.4753049362799031
Mr President, I want to talk about the EQUAL report, especially the issue of the policy on refugees.	1.476793534056728
Last week, we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government.	1.3331357612219774
Today, we are already discussing the Austrian coalition government' s policy on refugees because Mrs Stenzel, who is the author of the EQUAL report, of course represents Austria' s governing conservative party and its policy.	1.4159562459183535
The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention, that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees.	1.194758989015947
In actual fact, it is the other refugees, namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid, who need aid the most.	1.3478774705779841
The Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the EQUAL programme on identical conditions.	1.0363379512010875
Some members of the Committee, however, supported Mrs Stenzel' s proposal and wordings.	1.4617296337963623
As I see it, this means that Mr Haider' s politics are already casting their shadow over this Parliament.	1.0199504680856994
It is therefore crucially important that the Chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the EQUAL programme.	1.3529488154792109
I want, finally, to say that I had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the Austrian Government but, when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees, I have no misgivings.	1.471166502887221
I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time.	1.1749112601516345
Mr President, during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999, when there were 13 different initiatives in operation, the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative.	1.3933398365695489
The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe, a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States.	1.445319991671479
The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States.	1.018101901913896
Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland, I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III.	1.3821416238542106
The Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme, which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.	1.2024180180790487
The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years.	1.2238873640325578
The European Union is the single largest contributor, with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland.	1.3836589855764914
The European Union contributes 75% of the Peace and Reconciliation programme.	1.4794714295695088
All in all, INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process.	1.231948865274473
Mr President, I am taking the floor to speak about INTERREG, but I shall confine myself to a few criticisms, which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time.	1.4287964453083262
We have all spoken favourably of this programme' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation, in addition to cross-border cooperation.	1.2102955130410338
However, this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80% - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for INTERREG IIIA. Therefore, we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand, regarding the selection of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory.	1.4422470152676663
We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament' s position in practical terms, and not just with a formal tribute.	1.4181375321425327
Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies.	1.3917434246747242
This discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature.	1.0358044199146887
This is in line with ongoing discrimination, which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies.	1.2499941485087853
More serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as Malta.	1.2998244565980817
This has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the regions of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan regions.	1.0684899959420753
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative, opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area, even though it is true that more could have been expected, particularly with regard to access to the various strands.	1.2662571635077713
For a long time, probably a survival of our colonial heritage, our regions have fixed their attention on the European mainland, ignoring and even scorning their closest neighbours.	1.186833768903226
That time is now past.	0.7014185279049913
Our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to, not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples, hence the intensely expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment.	1.1418365283170744
This increased awareness does not, however, affect identity alone.	1.0079492789456712
It is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets.	0.8475698495217835
So, for example, the island of Réunion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia.	1.1965171482144754
It cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area, lest it miss out on a historic opportunity, and the same applies to our regions in the Caribbean.	1.1316776931156987
At last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment, the source of so much despair, if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the European structural funds.	1.2501121603730663
INTERREG appropriations may be used to make our regions into veritable European Union bridgeheads into these geographical areas, giving it worldwide scope.	1.1290446528407327
I am counting on the Commission, and specifically on you, Commissioner, to allocate adequate resources for effective action.	1.4430217490659114
Mr President, Commissioners, I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG, but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas.	1.3458937333511958
I understand the Commission' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation.	1.062385371914288
Nonetheless, there are many maritime areas between which links are already established.	1.2569090284345776
Various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this.	0.8377753577243611
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation.	0.6901800849145511
In consequence, I seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B. These adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects, particularly those of an infrastructural kind.	1.2046701088937737
Such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the EU.	1.0344405599640922
I hope for their adoption.	0.7898164112720624
Mr President, our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that, if you are a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group: you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems, rather than being defined as the problem.	1.2627105469586994
There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared.	0.9126563954517315
We also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level.	0.9397278347750969
We are concerned, therefore, as others have said, at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society' s most excluded, by aiming for a very narrow definition of "refugee".	1.3165111905821167
My group will not be supporting those amendments.	0.8463292319741557
We are also concerned at the number of amendments which, in seeking to introduce greater flexibility, run the risk perhaps of obscuring responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative.	1.2269014896209167
Mr President, I am very pleased to see URBAN orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems.	1.1765720869283642
Yet, there is some risk of dilution of effort. If we pursue too many objectives, our overall effectiveness suffers.	1.525909519159426
Of course, every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case.	1.296823514694795
But there is a common factor, a hard core, comprising unemployment, the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprises, both commercial and other kinds.	1.2781473113927166
I would wish URBAN to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation.	0.9093465004725485
For this, of course, central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy, so that the latter too can be reorientated and can work synergistically with the objectives of any URBAN programmes implemented in our countries, and so that it is not just using them as an alibi for its own shortcomings.	1.3482053426503313
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine my observations to Mr Decourrière' s report.	0.9647141780279069
The INTERREG Community Initiative Programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of European territory, most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and its outlying regions.	1.3811564115323254
INTERREG must, therefore, be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory.	1.226076264625534
It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme.	1.4861307873453575
Indeed, I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication, published on 13 October last year.	1.3759093420826514
Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III, I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme, financed by the ERDF, and the other external cooperation funds, including in particular the European Development Fund, intended for ACP countries.	1.406752090404235
In this connection, I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds.	1.0287661075809953
The most remote regions, particularly the four French overseas departments, must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF in order to fund, in turn, cooperation projects with their ACP neighbours in their respective geographical areas.	1.292443271750074
Furthermore, I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication.	1.3474033290538125
It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped.	1.313886850785328
Finally, in conclusion, I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C, for interregional cooperation, even though the added value this offers the Community is undeniable.	1.2517581779549585
Mr President, my starting point is the EQUAL report and equality between men and women, although I must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue, which has a feeling of déjà vu about it when you are my age, in any case.	1.3639880832822808
Unfortunately, it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality.	1.5375543683203745
A breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas, however.	1.1336345067406368
For me, equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a nanny, alias an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job.	1.0480486859487006
If that is the case, we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times.	1.3289742733265113
No, equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life.	1.302340604545567
Unfortunately, developments are not moving in that direction.	1.115873937895712
On the contrary.	0.7463588595757702
I think, therefore, that paragraph 7 contains something very central, i.e. that EQUAL will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies.	1.159355321545899
One can only hope that it succeeds.	0.9686605730068343
I should just like to say, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, that if I am not here when the Commission responds - not that I have asked any specific questions, but I should nonetheless hope that the Commission has been paying attention - then that is because the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is meeting to discuss women in the decision-making process at the same time as the present debate is going on.	1.448990185766199
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who work on rural areas know that, of the programmes which the European Union has managed, the LEADER programme, both LEADER I and LEADER II, is one of its success stories, and I hope that the same will be true of LEADER+.	1.5497739967867141
One of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the LEADER programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned.	1.2646765968153366
I am glad that LEADER+ is to remain true to this underlying concept.	1.0066052814177522
There is a problem, however, which we need to address together.	1.6822781970183114
Because LEADER is a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach, a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through LEADER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were.	1.124308085690308
And because of the programme' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from LEADER.	0.9644478875645113
That is why, where the good LEADER projects are concerned, we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly discontinued; instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable, positive component of our support to rural areas.	1.205308506556119
Of course this is also the basic idea.	1.1918181554614213
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER, with the participants on the ground, with the local organisations on the ground, with many non-governmental organisations, with the churches, with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities.	1.3661918419485042
Here we must ensure that the good schemes, those which are really excellent, are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work.	1.3371058586649018
My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted.	1.5818080658007507
There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation, which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known, pushed a little on to the sidelines, say because of official local or regional policy.	1.3179528151554205
Have faith in the successful results which LEADER has had so far.	0.8531779841782122
At the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic.	1.2420234425761039
And then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy, including ourselves at this level, could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well.	1.2775607421907733
That was the charm of LEADER, and that should please not be lost!	1.2619225884536787
Mr President, I welcome the EQUAL initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups.	1.2878701111431252
Women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender.	1.1502486461097157
This is why specific action for women is needed, as well as mainstreaming.	1.2692257331848549
The report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed.	1.1876424951500966
The involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the EQUAL initiative and the projects.	1.1066206511021843
The development partnerships within the thematic fields, which are referred to in Amendment No. 22, would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the EQUAL initiative.	1.30857217686729
My group will be supporting Amendment No. 22.	1.0929043590043894
Mr President, the report under discussion in the House today is doubtless of great importance.	1.4062513320878107
In addition to the objectives it is working towards, the strong point of the Community initiative INTERREG for the 2000-2006 programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include new Eastern European and Mediterranean countries.	1.4192539652081326
In my opinion, it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas.	1.2630784184037276
Indeed, these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the Union.	1.376223030894786
It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the utmost importance, and that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has subsequently taken up.	1.298430313223867
They call for the areas eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the Adriatic, as well as to the Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta - an applicant country - which, inexplicably, are not currently included in strand A, Annex 1.	1.2544218894851111
I am confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament' s position on the matter, in accordance with the Code of Conduct.	1.3729067371505326
There are fundamental advantages for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions.	1.2460059711273788
Finally, it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the INTERREG initiative and the existing Community programmes, which are significant for external policy, as a vector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes.	1.530523048495644
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, LEADER I was an outright success due, in particular, to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators.	1.4067380070329445
It is, I think, regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II, regarding the quality of the projects, the quantity of appropriations spent and, most especially, the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered.	1.3485383172850545
I am pleased to see, however, that under LEADER+, new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development.	1.2906832672403095
I feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment, in order to promote employment.	1.2530855969837382
The time is now right, I think, to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation.	1.363979635736993
It is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for LEADER II.	0.7947854699556282
Nonetheless, if the opportunity for Member States to determine the areas, within the scope of this initiative, remains available, then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and prioritise projects in the less prosperous areas.	1.4912413521742798
There must, of course, be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups.	1.0184193257507146
I also feel there are grounds for ensuring, in particular, that the financial channels of States or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some LAGs to become bankrupt under LEADER II.	1.2559969387627474
Mr President, as a Member from one of the outermost regions, I must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned, because of the debate on two Community initiatives, URBAN and INTERREG.	1.5186004732526381
I would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed, firstly, in the case of URBAN, at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various European cities, and, in the case of INTERREG, at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union, particularly by including the outermost regions in strands B and C.	1.4134156474216166
Like the rapporteur, we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand IIIA.	1.3917025673456602
With regard to INTERREG, we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concerned with cooperation.	1.4105001083585293
I would like to thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Decourrière, for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments.	1.355847853569966
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making.	1.5323754575356052
Mr President, with regard to the various initiatives which we are analysing this afternoon, I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them, that is, the URBAN programme.	1.4462474243480068
It is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the European Parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained.	1.4553744504819242
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives, but Parliament' s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained.	1.6175354742351578
I believe that we should be pleased about this.	1.1516617917123266
But what were the Commission' s arguments, from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular, for eliminating the URBAN programme?	1.283907386253243
Its argument was one of priority.	0.6334841251545894
The urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our belts and undervalue it with a programme which has such a small budget.	1.1799214410048235
Today the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achieved something important, that distinguishing mark of the European Union called the URBAN programme.	1.482110676453591
However, I would like to address Commissioner Barnier and support the argument of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and the Director-General, because I think they were absolutely right.	1.3722916750185348
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds.	1.0262117487111546
The amount of budget required by our cities - where 80% of the European population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in Europe, I believe, clearly indicates that the European dimension should be taken into account and that this URBAN programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail, not to prioritise and, therefore, not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities, by means of European funds.	1.4404083626993993
Therefore, I do not believe I need to restate the number of factors which demand this investment in urban areas, factors which are on the agenda, and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect.	1.281550713917704
In welcoming the cross-sectoral approach embodied in the new EQUAL initiative, it is crucial that the programme addresses the distinct forms of discrimination which militate against disabled people in particular: physical barriers in the workplace affecting those with limited mobility, visual information systems which exclude blind workers, working systems which effectively close the door on people with learning difficulties or with mental health problems.	1.073569309539824
Organisations of disabled people and disabled people' s non-disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making.	0.9663454717495217
That is why this Parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution, to ensure that Member States cannot ignore any one target group.	1.2457268964622736
Disabled people have too often been left off the list.	0.8222864244624031
Because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group.	1.2500509498950754
EQUAL remains crucial also to regions like my own, in the east of England, outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response.	1.3342593055980498
Former ADAPT projects range from the CORE project, which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in Bedfordshire, to projects to raise standards in small businesses in Hertfordshire in Essex.	1.216359156661338
We have seen the NOW project helping 70 women to return to work in Suffolk, many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels.	1.3092448574283289
EQUAL remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed, which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market.	1.102016255127656
Finally, a word on INTERREG.	1.5278208995097122
It really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links.	0.957620551632683
During this period the ports of Great Yarmouth and Harwich on the Essex-Suffolk-Norfolk coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the Netherlands.	0.8384756688590839
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2, which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas, particularly on maritime borders.	1.4635453756237957
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the information of the House, Mr President, I should like to make a clarification.	1.2076306215506287
Chancellor Schüssel' s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by Chancellor Klima.	1.1310021322946402
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria!	1.0808767614513348
Rural areas make up over 80% of the EU' s territory and 25% of the population live in them.	1.299217962705629
As a farmer and Member of Parliament, I have always endeavoured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole.	1.2583074221251846
I attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because I am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone; I refer, in short, to the multifunctionality of rural areas.	1.2565529988969824
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER+ programme because of its comprehensive nature.	1.3706913499816804
In the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the EU.	1.2795959677523163
This across-the-board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way.	1.1503340594415474
In the future, funding will no longer come from three funds but from the EAGGF Guidance section alone.	1.085643826247674
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the EAGGF is supposed to be an effective financial instrument.	1.2159200835597452
Greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness, because the money should not be squandered recklessly.	1.1773622119436755
In addition, I should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy.	1.3104865620148423
There is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside.	1.1364772645996808
That is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers.	1.3869860023485483
LEADER+ should supplement already existing programmes, avoid overlaps and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible.	0.9164306907843904
In this way, LEADER+ can, together with the programmes under Regulation (EC) No 1257/99, consolidate the second pillar of the CAP even more effectively and produce the best possible benefits for the whole of the countryside.	1.0623733919830631
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not always proud of the fuss that goes on here in Parliament, but the URBAN programme is one of the best examples of our work: it was created following an initiative in Parliament.	1.4068776536749426
The Commission would have abolished URBAN, but this time Parliament drew the longer straw.	1.3616248609637682
It is good that URBAN is to continue, as it has had good results at local level.	1.3092549477892714
The problems in Europe' s urban areas are getting worse; fortunately, we now have consensus with the Commission.	1.2014432996857896
The majority of the population of Europe live in cities, and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves.	1.3234588095192052
There is an immense risk of exclusion.	0.9880427055209613
In many cities in France and England there are now slums, breeding grounds for many sorts of problems.	0.9632006667608808
None of us wants South American type favelas in Europe.	0.705726082219865
We have to act now, before it is too late.	1.3962192410399474
Our cities are also of decisive importance for Europe' s economy.	0.9986336460289332
We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe: our economy does not support the individual sufficiently, nor is it sufficiently dynamic.	1.193330536293406
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow-citizens and our environment.	1.2682615846637821
This is not policy; it is life' s simple logic.	1.410177104825054
It is good that spending has become focused, as otherwise the buckshot gets scattered to the four winds.	1.1853098686796666
Now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle-size towns and cities, as they do not have enough resources.	1.2870194400615578
In this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas; it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand.	1.182105629914167
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship, as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally.	1.3718835133609333
Granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well: there will be enough to drink for a while, but tomorrow the well will be dry again.	1.1418984794238796
Mr President, with the implementation of INTERREG III, European cooperation policy is entering a new phase.	1.447095137901382
Our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones.	1.1065642613013589
In the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation, the European Union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions, particularly in Eastern and Southern Europe.	1.308316070323735
The Union' s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development, but - on the contrary - an opportunity, a bridge to more fruitful cooperation.	1.5008973077962577
By means of amendments adopted in committee, Parliament has tried to supplement the Commission' s work, by including new elements in the list of areas targeted for aid, and in particular external border areas and maritime border areas in Southern Europe.	1.2489076305359954
In its draft guidelines, the Commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past.	1.277712214614671
This is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the Mediterranean countries.	1.2558480767696887
As President Prodi too mentioned when outlining the strategic objectives for the period 2000-2005, boosting the Barcelona process is a priority for the Union, and the INTERREG III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective.	1.2342458000707222
In congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work, we can but hope that the Commission will duly take into consideration the proposals Parliament has put forward, in accordance with the commitments made under the Code of Conduct on the implementation of structural policies, and that it will confirm, with fitting amendments, the transformation of this Community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relations with neighbouring countries.	1.3906434581902585
Mr President, from this year until the year 2006 around EUR 200 billion is available for the Structural Funds, but only 5¾ % is set aside for the Community initiatives, INTERREG, LEADER, URBAN and EQUAL.	1.3861655392539411
That is a reduction of 3¾ % compared with the previous CIs.	1.1420619460096975
No more than EUR 2.8 billion is provided for EQUAL, as Mrs Stenzel' s balanced report makes clear.	1.2348809608748093
This makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing.	1.2515185954250543
How are priorities supposed to be set here?	1.0188226736525934
There is agreement on the principle that marginalisation, discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced.	1.252429133589965
Transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs.	0.9465712353035152
I have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the TAOs. Criticism of the previous Commission' s work was particularly severe, legitimately so, with regard to these Technical Assistance Offices.	1.2642408017465645
Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was, after all, in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to LEONARDO.	1.0899607862176064
The Commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under EQUAL either.	1.085145289319575
It can only approve Member States' proposals if they fulfil all the criteria: firstly, integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships, whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account; secondly, the systematic involvement of the operators concerned - the local, regional and national authorities, training institutions, universities, NGOs, the two sides of industry and the private sector - with the aim of creating a durable partnership, and thirdly, methods and models of indisputably innovative character.	1.2939046771688072
The Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work, of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices.	1.270398432333875
Only then will it be possible for the desired multiplier effect to be achieved.	0.9775536539460153
Mr President, I want to refer to the Commission proposals on the budget line to promote the CAP.	1.4160752827250602
On 26 October 1999 the European Commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the CAP.	1.3329226884129484
This proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget heading B1-382.	0.9296312399528226
Actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the EU and also create stronger links with EU candidate countries and the outside world are important.	1.1470812345777737
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme.	1.120971553602419
Given the need to encourage young farmers to continue in farming it is vitally important that they are well-informed about developments in the common agricultural policy.	1.1668725377530746
Informing and training young farmers at European level is vitally important.	0.854436358470083
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmers.	1.0178698688775614
Regarding information and training, in the past this budget line has been allocated for information, communication and training.	1.278172680868355
But the Commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included.	1.4099300781082473
I feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at European level about the CAP.	1.0513323479193348
Such European training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decisions for the future.	1.0285006385498012
Therefore I am putting forward three amendments.	0.5946846373261883
I would urge Parliament to support them.	1.0576573368106312
Mr President, I am taking the floor to express my opinion, drawn from my experience of municipal administration, that the URBAN projects should, or rather must, have a threefold purpose: firstly, to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic, old and perhaps dilapidated areas of cities.	1.4286402244435814
Secondly, to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres, within these old quarters of our cities.	1.3903656623652325
There is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully lit, with new pavements, with newly paved road surfaces, all whitewashed and beautiful, if we are not able to fill them with activity and, therefore, employment.	1.386672735703079
I would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators, but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment, or to put it another way, projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs.	1.3316425250778015
Thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families, because man is not made for the law, but rather law is made for man.	1.5970004343869075
These areas of our cities are often home to single-parent families, elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity, and families facing difficulties; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society.	1.1106107514408121
These people live in areas which should benefit from these projects.	0.9745891709097495
If we have success in this threefold sense, I believe that these families, these people, these European citizens, will believe more in Europe, and this seems to me to be very important because, ultimately, the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in European life.	1.5076391976739427
. (FR) Mr President, before my friends and fellow Commissioners, Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou, in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest, I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG, which many of you have brought up and discussed.	1.3885431325692583
Straight away I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs from the committees, from all the committees, but also to the speakers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speeches and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives.	1.3388745309490706
This is particularly true of what Mrs McCarthy said about URBAN. I should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also - and I do not see why I in turn should not say so too - for all we owe her, for all you owe her as far as this is initiative, as well as, more generally, all we owe Parliament.	1.497887767447838
I am mindful of the fact that it was in fact the European Parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban areas in difficulties, in favour of sustainable urban development, involving at the same time this integrated approach, which we value, to handle the economic, social and environmental aspects simultaneously.	1.4964239052135377
Some other points of agreement highlighted in Mrs McCarthy' s report, the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention, the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and, finally, the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes, on the basis of a real partnership.	1.2972913287801449
Having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission' s proposals and Parliament and, having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions, I should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made, with apologies if I cannot attribute each of the questions to the speakers by name.	1.4255119702406394
I think however that you will all recognise your own comments.	0.9844452128974566
Firstly on the subject of the URBAN programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns, which a number of you termed arbitrary.	1.2226201884109416
I can understand your concern.	0.8470393173544591
I have therefore asked my services to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of towns eligible under the URBAN programme conditional upon certain guarantees, firstly on concentration - I am thinking particularly of the target areas which must have a minimum of 20 000 or, in exceptional cases, 10 000 inhabitants - and also upon the critical mass of funding: we must keep to EUR 500 per inhabitant so that the European Union action may be both effective and clear, and so that it does not resemble a sort of scattering of resources which would have no real impact either for citizens or for municipalities.	1.3961747095512396
That is my initial response to the threshold question.	1.0200195929531204
Regarding a second matter, now, relating to the additional criteria, which should be taken into consideration in selecting disadvantaged areas. Here, too, I am willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criteria in addition to the Community criteria given in point 11 of the guidance project.	1.33552438509218
Third point: specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speakers mentioned them - women, but also immigrants and refugees, must be envisaged.	1.294193079118015
This concern, ladies and gentlemen, lies at the very heart of our URBAN initiative, and I am willing to rewrite the text, if necessary, in order to make this message clearer yet.	1.2184725899493
Regarding URBAN, I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention, first of all, the selection procedure.	1.214498588557968
Some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic, more transparent, and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding.	1.5613814968440438
Ladies and gentlemen, on this point we must make it clear: in the context of subsidiarity, the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for URBAN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States.	1.5065989589522255
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes, indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did.	1.5309416310450215
A second observation, the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes.	1.185924415136077
I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme.	0.9082571320802768
This cannot, however, be grounds for an extension of the original time limit.	1.2782296035067182
Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months.	1.0508631564560218
This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage.	1.443434661884058
With regard to URBAN, I should like to conclude with a final observation.	1.0510760391361502
One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative.	1.0094946664556432
I agree completely.	0.34648918224977204
I myself expressed my concern at the meeting of Ministers for regional and urban planning, a concern to which I devote myself, that in the DOCUPs and the CSFs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate, my concern, as I said, that, apart from the URBAN initiative, urban issues should be addressed in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programmes, and I believe I can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them, beyond the scope of URBAN, in all structural fund programming.	1.4432713121460743
But, as for the future, since we must look ahead, I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms, and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn, because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be, for future financial perspectives, a new European regional planning policy.	1.7053445614173526
I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important.	1.6158592803598024
Let me repeat what I have said, we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming.	1.0765967375386685
I should now, Mr President, like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur, Francis Decourrière, in the same way that I thanked Arlene McCarthy, for the quality and relevance of his work.	1.5213511481654123
He stressed a number of points, with which we may indicate our agreement, as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands, cross-border, transnational, interregional; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG, its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures and what, in discussing another debate which begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen, and here, with INTERREG, thanks to INTERREG, is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners.	1.452022198325127
Having made these general observations, I should like to focus on your main comments with regard to INTERREG.	1.0205677328281622
The first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative.	0.8862069159118874
You comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date, stressing, particularly your rapporteur, the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted.	1.4212608202683623
It is true, I admit it, and you are well aware of the reasons, ladies and gentlemen.	1.4483977757682196
There is a delay in adopting the INTERREG guidelines in March or April 2000.	1.045442822443094
I accept this; I take note of it as you do.	0.9522094895459486
I note, however, that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for INTERREG III and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now.	1.2225083712727511
I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January, if the programme is presented before 30 April.	1.293459847676849
So much for the first comment.	1.266515822833511
As to the second comment: regarding the non-comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand B, I wish to inform you, to confirm, that I have asked the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects, particularly in favour of small- and medium-sized businesses and of cultural heritage, in the list of schemes eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one.	1.4357792862997618
Third point: interregional cooperation, the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C, interregional cooperation.	1.264890348217307
As your rapporteur has requested, I shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand.	1.3162692654927255
Fourth observation: the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office.	1.2432627490626682
As you requested, I have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service outsourcing systems.	1.3693315311178855
But, ladies and gentlemen, if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TAO at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials' jobs needed to do this work, because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep redeploying the same staff indefinitely, at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre-accession structural instrument (ISPA) and in order to ensure that, the Community appropriations for which I am responsible, often in partnership or on terms of coresponsibility with Member States, are monitored better, with discipline and transparency.	1.3387989817469643
Now to the implementation of INTERREG, a subject mentioned by many of you, and the potential eligibility under strand A, 'cross-border cooperation' , of schemes in the Adriatic, on behalf of Sicily or for the most remote regions, the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, understands your concerns and takes note of your requests on these various points.	1.501009112778369
I therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand B: 'integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions' , so as to cover, in what I think is an appropriate fashion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions.	1.2486556689083659
In addition to this one overture there is a second which we have already suggested to the Member States: greater financial flexibility between strand A and strand B. Thanks to these two overtures, especially the first, I can say that the Commission is willing to examine the case of Italian regions and regions of third countries around the Adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under INTERREG, and with other instruments too, as soon as they become available.	1.4649875707726907
I have decided, in the end, that the most remote regions, to which I attach particular importance, will be given special priority in the context of the transnational strand of INTERREG, with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improving their links with their neighbours and other Member State regions.	1.3837573937561563
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF, particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.	1.1887475181366352
All this should make it possible for us, apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them, to confirm the role of 'active frontier' of the Union.	1.2575660189877746
I adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the Union are actually active frontiers of the Union, even if, or precisely because, they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear.	1.384075219147638
Another point: the coordination between INTERREG, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA.	0.8782783457475707
It is true, once again, and I accept this objectively, that there are still real legal problems.	1.4227521282209283
I do not want to minimise these, but progress is being made as far as strand A cooperation with candidate countries is concerned, even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain.	1.4017022088920579
The Commission must continue along these lines.	1.1292211226966167
I am making a personal commitment to do so.	0.8703742953575556
An initial joint PHARE/CIP committee is to meet in February to assess this coordination, and let me confirm my attentiveness and availability with regard to this, together with my colleagues and fellow Commissioners Verheugen, Patten and Poul Nielson.	1.2245548061512233
Finally, on the subject of technical assistance, on which your rapporteur and several of you commented. It goes without saying that the Commission will adhere to the terms of Article 23 of the general regulations regarding technical assistance, if it is indeed assistance intended to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general.	1.447495026213543
According to the general regulations, however, any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be proposed under Article 20, and not Article 23.	1.4872106356085857
This means that the ceiling of 0.25% mentioned in Article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance.	1.1740381256902626
I attach great importance, ladies and gentlemen, in a spirit of discipline and transparency, to our nonetheless retaining some financial strands for matters relating to the exchange of experience and information, and not to propaganda, and to the implementation of networks ensuring good communication of best practice within the Union.	1.232321483971717
My conclusion regarding INTERREG, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is that these Community initiatives for which I am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this. They also foreshadow a real European regional planning policy within our enlarged Union.	1.357742059890302
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to this, just as you yourselves do.	1.154892370951177
I remain at your service in order, when the time comes, to present the report of previous planning which you request, but also to keep you informed regularly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning.	1.365501098424842
Repeating my thanks to each and every one of you, and also particularly to Arlene McCarthy and Francis Decourrière, I should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar: only EUR 700 million for URBAN, but this is better than nothing; EUR 4 billion 800 millions for INTERREG.	1.2584653843435638
So we are working within this framework and not outside it.	1.0876725946381096
On the subject of these two initiatives, then, with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives, let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees.	1.307017984832577
Everything that I have just said, ladies and gentlemen, demonstrates that the Commission is resolved to taken the views of Parliament into account.	1.2301661226778928
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report.	1.1427406840069187
However, I should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the LEADER+ initiative.	1.516344464965285
This initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas, ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models.	1.1296519675361656
I am also pleased that Parliament essentially supports the Commission' s view that LEADER+ should be applied in all rural areas, that overriding priorities should be introduced and that, above all, active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged.	1.229004319040968
In addition, I note that Parliament shares the Commission' s view that the preferred form for implementing LEADER+ is the use of global grants.	1.249917064659907
Turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today, I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER+.	1.4083743153474606
The various groups, be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment, have the possibility of taking part in drafting the Commission directives.	1.193061054991501
And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either; there will be more.	1.2169215653286383
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new.	1.0197880941658635
There was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II.	0.9069193063601272
It has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual LEADER groups.	1.1163966323665315
The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2% of the LEADER budget.	1.2010909301318167
As far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned, I might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy, which means, in our view, that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of LEADER.	1.6122125865852168
I now come to the content of the report.	0.6331634311729072
In point 14, Parliament calls on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LEADER II immediately.	1.2971550599648671
I should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because, as you know, it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for LEADER II funds to be disbursed.	1.4024530180400347
We therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation.	1.0970144913376223
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it.	1.1417826719067405
In point 18, Parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives.	1.0083360272152677
In response I can only say that this already exists.	1.2073564672897987
It has already been compiled by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who is interested.	1.3716880275842802
In point 21, Parliament stresses that the guidelines in LEADER+ now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start.	1.4154608625382212
I can only fully share your concern.	1.0147661166241033
As soon as the opinion is adopted here in Parliament, the guidelines for LEADER+ will again be presented to the STAR Committee so that the Member States can confirm the provisional agreement which they gave on 14 November.	1.364892121978168
I assume that the Commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in March or April.	1.3999532123860812
And as soon as these are published in the Official Journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit LEADER+ programmes.	1.3481638810041086
I believe that it is important to point out one thing: expenditure effected under LEADER+ is eligible from the time that the Commission programme starts running.	1.2375907560170376
For all programmes submitted before 30 April of this year it will be possible to backdate the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 January.	1.1357328488285532
Finally, under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines.	1.4528168982353777
Having given them thorough consideration, I can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2, 4, 5 and 7 are acceptable to the Commission and are adopted.	1.295460187470178
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under LEADER+ is a maximum of 5 months.	1.0754825233826526
The amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has, in our view, been overtaken by events because, following consultations with the representatives of the Member States in the STAR Committee, this point has already been reworded along the lines proposed by Parliament.	1.2885536613536408
That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3.	0.754192469044458
The Commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the Commission itself had originally proposed.	1.3545612134643144
I must add, however, that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the Member States.	1.187557117523786
An amendment was therefore made in the committee, but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form.	1.2839944165038242
It will also continue to fight for Member States' acceptance of this.	1.1401702031997307
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled.	0.7416162519535114
Here there are only three which the Commission cannot accept, Amendments Nos 3, 12 and 13.	1.2148555793860008
It can accept all of the others either in full or in essence.	1.030395448490302
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time.	1.4630524105509053
Recently, because of political developments in Austria, there is growing unease within Europe. Political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue.	1.3811495576582982
It is worth stressing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies.	1.306449237861799
We need specific proposals, both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies.	1.2350491479512316
So I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package as soon as possible.	1.159700353085415
I now come to the EQUAL initiative, which is, of course, based on Article 13.	1.1588471936983327
The EQUAL initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of Article 13, namely the fight against discrimination based on race, gender, age, and special needs.	1.1585989077794487
I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs Stenzel, because her effort to reach agreement on the EQUAL initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex, both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue.	1.3989258738198749
The first comment, which has been made by many others too, is whether women should be mentioned separately.	1.4910161306550225
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about, but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place.	1.1707793580412844
So on the basis of the Treaty as it stands today, the EQUAL initiative is structured in that way.	1.6100383617553056
I would like to remind you, however, that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared, the fifth programme for equality between men and women.	1.254969229791042
I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups.	0.8646196511167697
Firstly, the enlargement of the thematic areas.	1.3059471828735476
As in employment strategy, there are four thematic areas: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament' s proposals.	1.1544339132093988
To answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination, I will say that the initiative states clearly that the Member States must submit one thematic category for each group that is suffering discrimination.	1.4138740361989768
The second subject is flexibility and simplification.	0.6835883096819964
I agree with Mr Leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand.	1.2583710973901128
That is why the services are already trying to revise the text, simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp.	1.0526366023131377
As regards the subject of flexibility, we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace, and at the thematic level where, for example, cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector.	1.3430788723427978
This would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs.	1.0456161887984123
Of course, a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the Member States, and a network which will assist the exchange of experience.	1.3809080435761785
Finally, I would like to mention technical assistance.	1.240098061871026
We are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available.	0.8450642047565158
First, funding for preparation; second, implementation; third, mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience, and fourth, technical assistance.	1.2072953466711465
Since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided, we must say that external offices will be used.	1.3699693330634128
As Mr Barnier too pointed out, it is impossible for all the work previously done by external collaborators to be done now by the Commission' s staff.	1.4418993996440477
The aim at national and European level is to establish large action groups by tender, with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested. We would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and appraised.	1.3416210396271269
I want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible, both for reasons of political timing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as planned, in other words, we must be absolutely ready by the end of 2000.	1.3711120267692936
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the Bureau and to the appropriate committees.	1.080479318949977
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.	0.7385079679823764
(The sitting was closed at 8.40 p.m.)	0.44685942276484353
Approval of the Minutes of the two previous sittings	1.111207284074743
The Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 3 February and Monday 14 February have been distributed.	0.8367321823494628
The Minutes of 3 February were originally distributed in Brussels so perhaps this is why some Members did not receive them.	1.3548070347985495
Are there any comments?	0.1337831580886173
(The Minutes were approved)	0.08791063492812108
Madam President, my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoons at 5.00 p.m.	1.1896389622247119
Yesterday it was impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here, because the 2.15 p.m. Air France flight, which normally brings us here, was cancelled, with no explanation from the airline, and we therefore arrived very late.	1.4782888692535043
If Air France insists on boycotting the European Parliament, we should take measures to prevent this occurring again.	1.3910548322680594
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.	1.2136757559378617
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation.	0.5888841017440186
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government?	1.1202520904826865
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly.	1.161253610624265
Madam President, I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday.	1.3838533018607426
I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union.	1.5153763555336766
Absolutely, Mr Napolitano. Thank you.	1.253763003376914
Madam President, off the subject of aeroplane delays, I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Caroline Lucas, who is a British Member.	1.1389393298846493
She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow.	0.9360474825245217
Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent, she was still held in custody all day.	1.1575908750208324
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology. I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala.	1.3359079950021608
Thank you, Mr Lannoye.	1.1813252923150441
I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative.	0.9155760696156465
Madam President, I should like to make a request in connection with today' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report.	1.2249077795546475
I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point.	1.3960386103449862
I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL.	1.173239786711264
We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning.	1.1893213230800586
Madam President, to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made: Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane.	1.2717174114693255
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest.	1.0097155685964667
I have, however, no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity.	1.1293088164965508
I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane.	0.9736406833937069
I did not hide behind any immunity.	0.7529963565444137
I took the punishment that came to me.	0.7361555351875659
Mrs Lucas should do the same.	0.6286491623656923
Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow.	1.103883803544959
In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee, and, given that it is a major Commission proposal, which refers to the agreements we reached last year, I consider it admissible.	1.5031269007914383
We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible.	1.238364888331038
Does anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel' s request, as supported by Mrs Ghilardotti?	1.2579979981606702
If not, then we will proceed to the vote.	0.7744749597214394
(Parliament approved the request)	0.6904443920255533
Madam President, under Rule 29(4) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group.	1.3502528276034742
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People's Party or does the Austrian People's Party continue to sit in that political group?	1.1668774935247574
Mr Corbett, I have not received any notification.	1.4857151427735678
Madam President, I am amazed at Mr Corbett' s reaction.	1.2318416849862466
He should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here.	0.8145740827761243
We are solidly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past.	0.8563556699270803
They have our full support.	0.30728307381377584
(Applause)	-0.0
Agenda	-0.0
With regard to the agenda for Thursday, following a request made yesterday in plenary, I propose extending the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance by half an hour to 6.00 p.m. when the vote will take place.	1.2952639945261484
(Parliament gave its assent)	0.06492846330865369
Commission's strategic objectives and legislative programme	0.6738268719262565
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 2000.	1.137843133859069
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.	1.0858031103787904
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a five-year programme is an extremely important undertaking, and this is why I preferred that you be given the unabridged text of the speech, which is available in four languages.	1.4256348427374552
To respect my speaking time, I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme: a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century, when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective, a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation.	1.3757052364415363
Let us remember that for half a century, Europe has provided us with peace, security and freedom and a united Europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity.	1.2292594263986958
We are now seeing the beginning of a strong recovery, which it appears may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are prudent with our policies.	1.3930200877592254
This recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made, but it comes at a price: it follows the restructuring of public accounts in European countries, which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a Europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries, banks and public services, even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go.	1.3356524643513448
Nevertheless, despite these aspects, European citizens are disappointed and concerned: by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough; by a Europe trailing behind in technology, and seemingly falling even further behind, and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too; by the European institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times, starting with the Commission itself.	1.4161738126637127
The crisis in the Commission was, in fact, a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens, and the low turnout at the European elections was a worrying indication of this.	1.5092777613361936
Even stronger still, however, is the sense of insecurity, the feeling of being unprepared in a new world that is moving forwards, a world which is completely changing, where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference.	1.3277822434430384
This is not the first time this has happened: Europe was once confronted with a similar transformation, an explosion of its markets, a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world.	1.3634119379343295
I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down.	0.7393968900174839
Some countries - such as France and Spain - managed to meet the challenge, giving rise to great nation States; other countries - such as Italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium: headway in science, technology, economic progress, defence structures and military organisation, philosophy and literature.	1.1850959485127943
Today, Europe is facing a similar challenge, and we know that, just as history has been unforgiving in the past, it will not be forgiving in the present.	1.4214388094411718
In this context of wholesale change, and in order to prevent our nation States vanishing again, in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges, Europe needs to be economically strong, because globalisation demands unity, because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at European level too.	1.353442652398827
But more vital still is a Europe that feels strong in the political arena.	1.0365054034087406
In years past, the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions, the mainstay of European life.	1.3470385418272495
Today, the new frontiers of European integration are political frontiers: common foreign and security policy, justice and internal security, and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based.	1.4455258494765268
The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-2005, a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar, so I will not go into detail about it now.	1.5016261964512672
Some of you may find it lacks detail, but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes.	1.2432154076958306
This is the European Union, not the Soviet Union.	1.5317164878347933
Our programme highlights the major points of reference, the major areas for action: firstly, the development of new forms of governance for Europe; secondly, extension and enlargement of the area of peace, freedom, and security; thirdly, the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy; fourthly, safeguarding and improving quality of life.	1.3534364054393773
These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years.	0.8032937445911522
With regard to the first area - new forms of governance for Europe - you already know that the Commission has undertaken to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since, in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact, the Commission is first of all preparing for a debate; we will subsequently discuss the content with you; this will give rise to a policy document, and finally, a legislative document.	1.5855381399290982
This is an effective, transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe.	1.3705603895702516
This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us, an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions, rethink our very policies - all our policies - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number 25 or 30, and what will be the best thing to do at individual State level, at regional level and at local government level.	1.4291813133014344
But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself.	1.4614551809544511
We must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient, to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved, starting with the important issue of the involvement of women.	1.2240972370165621
One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital, as women' s involvement in economic life, an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe. This is a field where Europe has, nevertheless, always been in the vanguard.	1.4338323189937487
We therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind, and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies.	1.4553207079326629
We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001.	1.3933214798765234
It will not be a philosophical Paper, but a practical Paper, full of focused proposals.	1.3629998327396453
We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must have a total rethink, and we shall therefore do two things: we are, and will continue to be, fully committed to internal reform, and we shall rethink our policies in detail.	1.629547115890768
I have asked all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo.	1.4771947322395906
The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are, what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activities, thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual countries, regions and local communities.	1.179449095321778
So we shall be freeing up new resources, but - I fear, and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will, in turn, be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks: I am thinking of enlargement, the new sector of justice and home affairs, health issues and environmental matters.	1.5302274567138157
When that time comes, when we have used up all our resources, I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources, but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources, we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on.	1.5559180518809477
As for internal reform, you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one.	1.2481543085693672
I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform, if it does not become more efficient, if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors, starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid.	1.2464857712904611
Providing aid rapidly, when it is needed, saves human lives; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all.	1.043286509705436
When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems.	1.3275099559918266
My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner' s efforts, of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication, but I also think of new events, such as Croatia, where the situation has changed in a few weeks: the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia' s problems, but more particularly Serbia' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia.	1.4893858960884854
This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans.	1.3916678450494269
We must increase our efficiency in this area. We must reopen the Danube to boats.	1.4243687588166465
It is contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource.	0.8485801328116922
We must decontaminate the river and, in view of this, over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem.	1.3162077925108975
We have done a lot in the Balkans: the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo, the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures.	1.503776145786431
Nevertheless, we definitely have to do more.	1.5996348353839145
We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic, pluralist society in these countries with institutions, public structures, police forces and a structured civil society, but, above all, we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region, as regards both politics and the economy.	1.4300534986496671
If we do not do this, we shall have failed in our duty.	1.3793184921719535
Remember that the Marshall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources: it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horizon; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy.	1.1912583391434213
This is what we need to do for the Balkans.	1.3600485718147122
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security, peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage.	1.3060853575402354
We are clearly, once again, returning to enlargement, which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security, peace and freedom.	1.0375093489539378
We have made many promises in this regard, but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread.	1.429379496553359
Indeed, enlargement, which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond - I am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries - must hinge on concrete, objective criteria, and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and, to an even greater degree, public opinion in our own Member States.	1.443098877418337
There will be friendship, calm, openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process.	1.0527101236206307
I repeat: we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance.	1.3656975273410115
Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement, or at the Balkans.	1.1064476987579792
There are certain other key issues: relations with Ukraine, relations with Russia, relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly, the important question of relations with the southern Mediterranean which will be a crucial point for European history, and for security and peace in Europe for future generations. In this regard, we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa.	1.3912966730579912
In recent times, Africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help, but nothing tangible has yet been achieved. In recent years in Africa, we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy, but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes.	1.3440854605489474
Africa is, for us, a worrying topic for discussion. We therefore have another duty at international level, which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade: the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries, not just in terms of writing off debts, but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world, with a great deal of willingness on our part, which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice.	1.5210290715251262
We need to provide alternative answers, otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe' s positive roles in history.	1.2025057023523136
All over the world, Europe' s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities.	1.1478759891243446
We should remember that we, the European Union, are a union of minorities: we are all a minority within Europe.	1.508751519271161
There are concerns even within the Fifteen, concerns which may even surface again in the next decade.	1.2681551562894608
I am referring to the situation in Austria, where the Commission has remained true to its role, being duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union, but also the unwavering guardian of the Treaties, ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy, law and respect for minorities.	1.28505297076397
Some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message I sent to Chancellor Schüssel.	0.7687446801182406
My message to you is: do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content.	1.2550327107476686
Reread the letter: The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat, Article 6 of the Treaty.	1.307793876842591
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the Commission when they were elected.	1.3402333852983337
This is what we wish to do: maintain our role as a supranational structure, maintain the role conferred on us by the Treaties, but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts.	1.271569224750583
Last November, the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive.	1.314611657560315
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion.	1.374018668183167
I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme: the economy and quality of life.	1.1081832298583534
I have already talked about the economy: we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs.	1.0889771807744009
We must continue to keep inflation under control, proceed with liberalisation, ensure more competition, encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies; push forward with science, and push back scientific boundaries, and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science.	1.0632189349715573
The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dissemination of technology, employment - will be a decisive summit.	1.298147046609064
It has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind.	1.2646853657324197
We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers.	1.0721590859886692
Finally, our last commitment is to improve quality of life.	1.4827786140177486
We have opened this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety: we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector.	1.2039817207565955
The Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment.	1.0622235832713143
The time has come to discuss, and then establish, a body for emergency civil protection in Europe.	1.2961017589808728
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred.	1.0398326907257114
I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen.	0.9726880968277278
These are the challenges that we - the Commission but also all the other European institutions - are facing.	1.533673875119139
How will we judge, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, the five years of our mandate?	1.1843923894091697
How are we going to assess the results of these five years?	1.094916020710154
I do not know, but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together.	1.560374238414986
Let us take a very simple parameter: turnout at the next European elections.	0.808782403792368
If it is higher than at the previous elections, it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge.	1.300079174859764
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with all these major political challenges, but precisely because of the recovery that is now underway, we are also faced with major opportunities.	1.4054023679157537
This, ladies and gentlemen, could be the decade of Europe. Indeed, I would say that this must be the decade of Europe.	1.403342069237744
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate.	1.1458473815310077
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document.	0.9238114073555971
And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given.	0.9289774830340636
We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes.	1.4637378069573792
Europe will press ahead with integration; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will, in the end, reunite our continent.	1.1672213845180168
A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission.	1.005732386531048
However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present.	1.4833164590864336
I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully.	1.1831274395959106
I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union.	1.1453368022128148
We in the European Union are one Community.	1.3466361398520275
We belong together, even when there are problems.	1.2266460853287962
Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe.	1.075146347056956
Mr President of the Commission, you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks.	1.2737420886881867
You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties, and that is indeed your role.	1.10513800199858
For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned, we expressly respect, acknowledge and support you.	1.2837529342801015
(Applause)	-0.0
Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same: we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century, a democratic Europe which is able to act.	1.3573103193979412
A Europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and, at the same time, looks after its global interests with dignity, patience and convincing self-confidence.	1.043471460795821
Europe' s message, the European Union' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development.	1.3742105441763366
Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world, which is becoming smaller and smaller, as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity.	1.3810495558823932
Seen in this light, globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger, more of a coming together than a segregation, more mutual enrichment than separation.	1.1839221341510053
But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans.	1.308960728080013
Globalisation is not only an economic process, it is also a cultural process, which is why we say: we want partnership in the world, we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting, we want partnership, a meeting, exchange and peace.	1.4979127262232534
But we also say: we want to defend this European Community of tolerance, which is why a common foreign, security and defence policy is so important.	1.5663972155320658
Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today, bringing the European family a step closer together.	1.0902427593945405
We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process.	0.9795634742373245
All the countries in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity, democracy and the rule of law.	0.8024385123610752
For us, the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, it is not only the reform of the institutions of the European Union which will be important in the next five years; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidating the European currency in coming years.	1.3404527125986485
We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact.	1.097878436451735
We need structural reforms in the European economy.	1.392745831657532
Most importantly, we need to restore a European economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs.	1.104845678586551
It would be Europe' s undoing if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium-sized businesses in Europe.	1.1255574530384809
(Applause) The Commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays.	1.2483858344083374
We too want to help put Europe on its feet.	1.0071572416898946
You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	0.74935537285915
We support that.	0.3463717403047317
The nations, regions, towns and communities of Europe will be preserved.	1.0771791452206902
However, there is a current trend - the "fauna, flora, habitat" directive was quoted as an example - which, in my country at least, creates the impression that associations are bypassing national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to Brussels and that Brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural holdings in the countries of the European Union.	1.1876371759191773
I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future.	1.208706378620502
Mr President of the Commission, allow me to close with these words: as the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, we have every interest in a strong Commission.	1.2532440828585503
If you are persuasive in your actions, we all reap the benefits.	1.2496465384015607
In this respect we wish you every success. However, we are also aware of our role as the Commission' s watchdog.	1.522417088026043
If we have the merest suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the European Union, and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case -, but if European law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement uncompromisingly, precisely because peace in the European Union is founded on this law.	1.5158238133462123
We must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world.	1.1815019373501994
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of, and the first ever debate on, the Commission' s programme for government - the word President Prodi is so fond of; as I am -for the whole legislature.	1.416102430914912
Firstly, this is welcome because it explains, to our fellow citizens, what we are intending to do and what we are already doing. We must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future.	1.6245150701121214
We have taken almost eleven months - President Prodi was nominated at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme. This is not entirely President Prodi' s fault.	1.3502001438883466
We are recovering from a crisis. However, I believe that, in the future, it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next Commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme.	1.2819636729005903
We are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances.	0.7109489325816245
President Prodi began his speech by talking of a paradoxical situation, a paradox in the European Union and also throughout the world: we are at the dawn of a new secular millennium, dominated by the web of the Internet and the sorcery of biotechnological advance, and we are living through a genuine change of epoch.	1.3420990311196122
However, to focus on the European Union as it is today, and on the subject of government and governance - a word which, at least in Spanish, brings to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, although it may be an appropriate word anyway -, the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government, and, since President Prodi always defends his home town, Bologna, I would advise him to go to Siena for a while and see something which we all understand: the frescos of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which speak of bon governo [good government] and mal governo [bad government].	1.4716463916268272
What we need here is good government, Madam President.	0.9046771062340254
Since we are recovering from a very complex crisis, we must try to enhance our institutions and give them substance.	1.2100075564673414
I would like to remind the House of something which we often forget, and that is that the investiture of the Prodi Commission, last September, received wide support. In our opinion, this demonstrates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of Europe.	1.3701674155352919
I would like to point out that, within this broad consensus, there were some Groups which said that the majority of Parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the Council.	1.3365020927097646
It is precisely this which, in a sense, is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme.	1.4170408779887345
I am pointing this out because I believe that our support for the Commission also has to lead to continuity in the work carried out throughout the legislature.	1.3212483891011364
On the other hand, we are witnessing the birth of a political Europe, which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon, and a European Union at the service of the citizens.	1.470348742218014
With regard to the events of recent days, I would like to say - and I am saying this on the day, and the week, that the Intergovernmental Conference is starting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which, given what we have said about the Austrian crisis, I believe should be fully included in the Treaties.	1.5857301704856905
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point.	1.5360877789049128
In this regard, Madam President, I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language.	1.0215066003256297
Last week, the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre.	1.341068389844026
Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments.	1.0079038090506476
There can be no democracy without a living parliament.	0.7542987346373107
I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now.	1.268035433969049
With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us, I would say that we are very much in agreement.	1.317642164566391
Nevertheless, I would point out to the Commission that, as far as the Socialist Group is concerned, there has been a change of priorities.	1.512890082884779
We understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda, which also includes what is known as 'quality of life' priorities, that is to say, the rights of citizens as consumers and as people, in relation to those questions which we always talk about, but never give sufficient priority to, that is, the European social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances, consumer rights, respect for the environment and sustainable development.	1.4808414743155063
When speaking of the commitment to full employment, we have to bear in mind that, these days, full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War, that is to say, employment for the male head of the household.	1.217206510759217
We must argue for equality of the sexes, the famous 'gender mainstreaming' , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission' s programme.	1.2088620014883764
This means prioritising sex equality, the adaptation of the social model and, above all, an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat.	1.2574137749775458
This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission. It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics.	1.426215633275993
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue.	1.372976740293595
In this respect I would also add another element, which is economic government, given the single currency, and I believe this is inescapable. This is another question on which the Commission must make progress.	1.6843485944036412
With regard to the ambitious objectives and, above all, the Commission' s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration, I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000.	1.4092033872935936
Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision?	1.149550203851891
The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential.	0.9477426236396786
With regard to governance in general, I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms.	1.2698911575143288
I would like to remind you of one thing: it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here.	1.4178678488191183
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity.	1.1773002313133543
If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is, I think that would be very positive.	1.4774803481012582
In all other areas, I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion.	1.0937966804606936
Not only should the Commission discuss this, but also our states, our parliaments and our civil society.	1.484815938733523
Madam President, I would like to refer briefly to the last objective, which seems to us to be absolutely fundamental: the stabilisation of the continent and the strengthening of the Europe' s role in the world.	1.248981569051385
It appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of South-East Europe, with regard to enlargement and - as I have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts, as well as an issue which we seldom talk about; the North-South challenge.	1.3607706895304168
We must not forget Africa, a continent which has been forsaken, not only by God, but also by Europe, nor our important contribution to cooperating with development.	1.4800447127321452
Lastly, an issue for which we are increasingly responsible, as the world' s foremost economic and commercial power, that is, Europe' s voice in the world, which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the Millennium Round.	1.4429968077203827
It means the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions, for which Europe has an enormous responsibility.	1.3677395499873015
Above all, Madam President - and here I will end - we must be able to express this in plain language, clearly, by changing to some extent the jargon which we use, because we cannot ask the Europeans, who are living through profound changes, to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely inaccessible.	1.5157764909202522
This is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us. I hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next European elections.	1.4165597264011636
Mr President of the Commission, may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure, the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today: that is that the stakes now are irrefutably political.	1.4316114497851695
They are political because we are moving on.	0.8834989659067372
Even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks, we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective.	1.297241639531367
The challenge of enlargement is political.	0.967255163969255
The challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs, of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime, is very political.	1.3252403671290078
The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political.	1.1749907065241736
Because it is political it is more complex.	0.8996425502972542
Because it is political it is more sovereignty-sensitive.	0.6958647654454143
Because it is more sovereignty-sensitive it is more voter-and citizen-sensitive.	1.0591298662641215
We need, therefore, to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives, to address, not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy, the apathy which you identify.	1.4283261529794145
The means of achieving this are difficult but they are real.	1.1208726292890046
I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions, not just between Commission and Parliament, but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge.	1.6075036935925298
We need more dialogue, not just with each other but also with civil society.	1.3744099024917762
We need more explanation of what Europe is about.	0.9088507698754638
We need to be able to confront fears and anxieties, because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself.	1.173265340878241
Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that.	0.8755149736076354
My group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring addressing the issue of governance.	1.0625204973409248
As we look at the Europe of networking which you describe, it is very important that Europe concentrates on its core business, that we have the courage to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back.	1.3157239043151578
That could convince people that Europe, in its governance, is not something run exclusively from Brussels, which concentrates and soaks up more powers, more decisions, more authority.	1.508262371459598
That is the political core of the challenge and I think you have identified it well before this House today.	1.40687069082159
For my group, enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured, be they governance, be they the intergovernmental conference, be they reform of the institutions.	1.4110649516863853
We see enlargement as a process of partnership, not a process of "them and us".	1.0165413037344204
We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states.	0.762839566111022
I suggest to the Commission, as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement, to present a document, that explains the value of enlargement, not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense; a document, like the Cecchini report before the Single Act, that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand, historic challenge facing Europe today.	1.5109753748830066
We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully.	0.9843618178451314
On south-eastern Europe, I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements.	1.1175907320986884
In the lifetime of this Commission and this Parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south-eastern Europe.	1.0540348076820554
We applaud the stabilisation and association agreements, but we would like to see more.	1.4243987065087498
We will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week.	0.9285876797520782
The strategic paper emphasises the global role of the European Union.	0.7772657967410198
Our central aim must be to give the Union a weight in global affairs commensurate with its weight in terms of aid, trade and finance.	1.1189310817204894
At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end, and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies, where we fit into UN agencies and so on.	1.175307522763167
We need to open that debate.	0.9656440138437754
In conclusion, this morning, the day after St Valentine's Day, the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over.	1.3614165229280515
I do not know whether you are a romantic or not, Mr Prodi.	1.2874625656215528
Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning.	1.2684978112594192
However, we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business.	1.3918933090304888
That is the way it should be.	1.702756182075062
Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me, in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues, give in one adjective, one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance: an enabling Europe.	1.4442630557277616
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally.	1.397518730942375
You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme.	0.8822224448131619
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones.	1.2401053950716672
At the same time, however, it has to be said that, unfortunately, your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto.	1.2464024581433233
There are a lot of good intentions in it, but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved.	1.2700190487440417
As in any other party manifesto, it is full of contradictions.	1.2712187734392923
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them.	1.0304167100856085
First let me speak about the economy and social development.	1.111985744651408
We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment; that is what was mentioned in your programme.	1.302738959783495
Should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria, in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than, say, the three most successful countries in this matter?	1.5022591783100319
Ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of, because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure. But, unfortunately, as we all know, this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act.	1.4702029692262268
Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference.	0.4995417873440983
The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone.	1.1458693822814923
In this respect, Parliament will definitely defend, along with yourselves, the importance of supranational decision-making.	1.271486323931281
One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation.	0.6926664269345522
I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of 'global administration' , as others too have said here.	1.3954914360204183
However, please learn from the events of Seattle: we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade, on the one hand, with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend, on the other.	1.4720582094929509
You must embark on a dialogue with the international community.	0.6533886037716856
Do please try to make the international organisations democratic.	1.07279775429574
The European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring.	1.4423938729305221
We can submit motions for this together with you.	0.788431536800791
Finally, I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society, although, unfortunately, this is another contradiction.	1.3584129794127857
You ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the IGC.	0.934385644142012
We have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making.	1.1476470527167737
What you just said is absolutely true: people want more engaged democracy.	0.9083571078485347
In my opinion, this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too.	1.348851921564603
Madam President, my group was one of those which wanted to have a document allowing an exchange of views on the Commission' s strategic objectives within the group before this debate, instead of being reduced to an on-the-spot reaction in plenary.	1.26097186602131
The main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists.	1.501688498573126
We are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which Mr Prodi has just underlined and, in some cases, usefully clarified.	1.2555271052732258
The current globalisation process is - and I quote - 'exclusive rather than inclusive and has widened the inequalities' . The European Union' s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rules within the Union and in international relations.	1.4056990958696327
Clearly, many citizens are 'disenchanted and anxious' about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems, such as unemployment and social exclusion, which affect our very existence. This must be one of our absolute priorities.	1.3306993287340596
We do need to rethink many aspects of current Community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success. We also need 'distinctive strategic partnerships' with our neighbours to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace.	1.3182614243266955
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion.	0.689202116364671
We will carefully study the planned White Papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised.	1.0433044280646369
It is in this spirit that I have three criticisms to make. These must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new Europe, as proclaimed ambitiously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi' s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric.	1.4748120162445324
The first and most serious criticism concerns the Commission' s propensity for rather grandiloquent self-satisfaction with regard to the European Union and for a cursory and even condescending view of our partners.	1.2144137556791608
The perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the Commission communication.	1.1595615239884869
This talks of the European Union as 'living proof that peace, stability, freedom and prosperity can be brought to a continent' and as a model showing the world the way forward. It concludes that 'our neighbours have the chance to join this prosperity, and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so' .	1.3540634228822719
A more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view.	0.9440236828863046
Similarly, the idea that the euro has fostered a consensus on wage moderation is not really borne out by the repeated nervous orders issued by the European Central Bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding.	1.3682555259404534
My second criticism follows on from the first.	0.7573374598748962
This extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and, where necessary, confronting these is seriously limiting the will, duly confirmed by Mr Prodi, to grant public demands.	1.2808555668005661
For example, at least in the countries which I know well, I doubt that the intention, repeated three or four times in the Commission document, to reform 'Europe' s social protection, health care and pension systems ...in a climate of more cautious public spending' will meet the needs of those whose confidence we apparently want to win back.	1.3675158839577286
My third criticism stems from the first two. The weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an overabundance of generalisations, a rather indecisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus.	1.1098921787254867
But all is not lost.	0.6759700802481876
This is a starting point and we have five years to succeed, provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity.	1.3533890894227603
My group is fully intent on helping with this work.	0.9258088689432517
Madam President, reforming and democratising the institutions of the European Union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process.	1.241450414422866
This was the opening statement of Commission President, Prodi, when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years.	1.6693948210204166
We await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union dealing with the issue of balance between Member States' governments and the European Union institutions which is to be published this summer.	1.3951190415043078
On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the Commission.	1.3186876357245598
The Commission, in its proposals to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference, has indicated that its preference lies in seeing smaller Member States lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the European Commission.	1.2606306551292292
This is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States.	1.3552122657738799
I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built.	1.007674019539945
I believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaties.	1.2782968768524483
There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions.	1.2895785788706875
I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small Member States to nominate a European Commissioner that the United States of America gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the United States Senate.	1.3078487351617238
More or less each of the 50 states in the US has two elected positions in the United States Senate, regardless of its population.	1.1352049510165276
Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country.	1.2467625392056092
It would be very difficult for those who propose a 'yes' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission.	1.2012086697986226
Undoubtedly, reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer.	1.3917907607728237
Once again there are special areas of policy-making which should be left to the domain of the national Member States.	0.9965400505186109
I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation, justice and home affairs, and foreign affairs at European Union level.	1.1253855966886923
At present, under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome, decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity.	1.136479732701605
I believe that this proposal should remain, as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the European Union.	1.2063223564016967
I support the enlargement of the European Union.	0.8162034171312836
I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner.	1.155374151104716
However, we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties.	1.403804894863325
Changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping, otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed.	1.1008967886701282
Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members.	1.0658468676262034
President of the Commission, a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five-year plans.	1.2001436764444484
This is true, if we think of Russia' s plans in the thirties, but at the start of your mandate, a few months ago, you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would, however, be presenting a legislative programme, or rather, the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today.	1.5234639938327856
So, whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme, the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions, or rather a list of issues on the table. It does not, however, give us the impression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these points, but that it is just doing the European Commission' s duty.	1.579425105374727
In this House, in the past, large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission, under its power of initiative, launched, not as experiments, but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress, but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union.	1.4691395652565868
In this case, Mr Prodi, we certainly have a kind of "Ten Commandments" : a whole raft of issues are listed, but if I may say so, we are left with the impression that the Commission is afraid to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points.	1.4368967379341406
There was only one point that you really stressed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease "unnecessary" activities.	1.3885108353863638
We should be careful, though, Mr Prodi, because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and backed this Commission - at least a parliamentary majority backed this Commission - precisely because, first and foremost, the reform of the Commission would bring consolidation, a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand.	1.397301978169071
Let us consider the scenario whereby the Commission, not believing itself to be equal to the task, wishes, or proposes to shed, for example, its powers to implement common policies, which it is nevertheless accorded by the Treaty.	1.4105335629051692
What do we expect from a government in any case?	1.2351551578241577
What do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which is, so to speak, ambiguous and unique?	1.4006050987590826
It is right for joint resources to be controlled supranationally and not to be delegated to the Member States or the TAOs, as has been the case in the past.	1.2921465983814944
It seems that you are proposing the same old menu, but with more unsatisfactory implications, restricting the Commission, so you say, to the task of drawing up a few White Papers, as you proposed.	1.5970347444700357
My fear - even if you shake your head, Mr Prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years, that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers.	1.5784803798409732
If this is the role that the Commission intends to play over the next five years, we federalists are convinced, we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intends to do in this regard.	1.5449182866567415
The reform is important but, if it aggravates the situation, reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the Commission, then the structure of European integration, as planned by the founding fathers for the European Commission, will be at risk.	1.472789255778349
	-0.0
As for the other points, Mr Prodi, I will take economic and social policy as an example: the European social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve, but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past, without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that Europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective.	1.3964093637760622
If we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far, I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do.	1.326542887366534
The same goes for enlargement as an end in itself, without it being linked to a reform to make the European Union and its structures much more efficient, and to proposals that the Commission could have made at the IGC.	1.4560177829761933
Mr Prodi, there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members, regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government.	1.4431416579072627
We approve of your position on this: you did well not to isolate that country any further.	1.1463767896422243
In any case, we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action.	1.2496024233542502
Mr Prodi, I repeat that this is, in our opinion, a slightly short-sighted view.	1.560013811837256
Above all, it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned, for example, as regards the Balkans.	1.358905433534428
Can we really continue to leave the Balkans out of the enlargement process, disregarding the fact that Croatia, Macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this House that is open to all?	1.3198279631076981
Madam President, Mr Prodi, I should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the Union' s activities and ask why, then, you are proposing a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation.	1.4221064325545303
I remember your predecessor' s speech five years ago.	0.8861242814869186
Like yourself, he promised "less and better" , but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered "much more and much worse" , and I do not believe that you, either, can deliver the goods you promise.	1.396776445509839
You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation.	0.691383877276116
The legislative programme is, in fact, a litany of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which, Mr Prodi, you are to take influence away from the people, even on social questions.	1.4241473892226721
You talk about greater transparency, but produce proposals which would lead to documents which, at present, are available for public inspection being locked away.	1.2717960516738038
Your Commission consists of the only 20 people in the EU who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced.	1.0703813089230068
Local politicians cannot do that, once legislation has been passed in Brussels.	1.2266702535917886
The legislative programme from the Commission ought at least, therefore, to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the Member States and to the processes of popular democracy. Otherwise, the number of laws produced in Brussels will just keep on growing.	1.2827146188981373
We have passed 10 000 laws and as many amendments, and the applicant States have had 26 000 documents sent to them which, as debated by the Polish parliament, fill 140 000 sides of paper.	1.3239515130042108
Even by this stage, that is already too many by far.	1.2426930941378262
Brussels should make decisions on fewer matters and hand over more decisions to the people, the regions and the Member States. The only decisions which should remain with Brussels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legislate on effectively.	1.3989201382691778
What is more, the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent, so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process, now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them.	1.2612714278565171
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell' Alba' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of. Take a look at Jean Monet' s memoirs.	1.3255212875484423
What he envisaged was what he called a small, practical secretariat.	0.8524221930798649
That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today.	1.145462039308069
Madam President, this morning the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years, laudable aims indeed, to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world: succeeding with enlargement, meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe, introducing better principles of governance.	1.4299287719142546
We accept that Europeans, particularly the younger generation, need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead.	1.2350372468767026
But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high?	1.2317484378756847
We need to match this vision with reality.	0.9637859570011599
Here there are three elements I would like to contribute.	1.3262288887082814
Firstly, we need a successful European economy.	1.5196400787385145
We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across Europe, confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation, encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet, show that e-Europe is a good initiative.	1.1928444595452234
But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation, stifling individual initiative and enterprise.	1.0967958245224014
We must not fear globalisation, but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society.	1.3426057560682398
Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead, particularly of enlargement.	1.191707663167097
Secondly, we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity.	1.2423104175901512
Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too.	1.4063423661799037
We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation.	1.0587324608395938
Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to go in a different direction.	1.295807886097865
We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes.	1.1353018688773124
Lastly, we need to ensure that there is proper, genuine reform of the European Commission.	1.3623272792391603
Yes, the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body, but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament.	1.6702542518724344
The information problem, which Mr Bonde just referred to, is treated like a straw in the wind, with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us, as citizens and as parliamentarians, although we have the right to it under the Treaties.	1.4146686273898839
The Commission is not in fact today a European government.	1.2506269146689595
The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament.	1.0592145762294398
We in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe.	1.1587253018273191
This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union, has its relevant role to play.	1.366237711102285
Therefore we need to have credibility, coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens.	1.3626483240451057
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union, from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy; even to the response by the 14, the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria.	1.5126731168758285
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions.	0.9837434833868528
Nonetheless, I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission, that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge, inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which, to put it mildly, have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent.	1.488010586249689
That does not apply to Austria alone.	0.72592013619417
The Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria.	1.193033265565152
However, the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and, in the final analysis, represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens.	1.3350023098960193
When it comes down to it, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough.	1.1581061962143302
In this sense, the Commission must insist, and I should like to endorse and confirm this here, that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding, enforceable rights.	1.5199082935222175
In this sense, the Commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom, security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speakers.	1.2614421954035442
Only reasonable, feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational, misleading and demagogic allegations of the extreme right.	0.7502381618364112
But, and I would like to stress this, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment, marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-European, nationalistic actions and reactions.	1.300900250445953
In this respect, Mr President of the Commission, I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population.	1.2098346123932084
The feeling of being at the mercy of others, of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote, as in the European elections and, in the worst case scenario, to extremist voting patterns.	1.3564534875500005
The Union, like everyone else, has not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation.	1.450487166698188
We are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house.	1.0835298126396289
What we need are not just reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the economic architecture - and, significantly, the President of the Commission forgot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture; we also need confidence-building measures for our citizens, who rightly expect help and support from and in the EU with the inevitable and painful process of adapting to new global circumstances.	1.4153512661878482
In this respect, what the Commission says about boosting Europe' s voice is important.	1.2466299074733118
You yourself, Mr President, spoke of a model of which, unfortunately, there is little mention in the document. You said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural and ecological development, both internally and towards the outside world, which differs from other models, including the US model.	1.4823630987440533
In this sense, the USA is not only our partner; it is also our competitor; not our opponent, our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model.	1.3550032679862276
I hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the Commission documents.	1.492719490614674
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the greatest legacy which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help resettle and redistribute the increasingly jumbled and confused powers and competences of the Commission, and perhaps of the Union itself.	1.4238676152851315
You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called "core tasks".	1.0162818598870798
That, as you have said yourself today, means that you must also identify tasks, policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission's main vocation.	1.418285243545964
Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date, or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at European level.	1.1044091363186135
The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national, regional and local government.	1.002342728078475
If we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical European public of the merits of further European integration, we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted EU powers as we are in the evolution of new EU powers.	1.2743576983147358
We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim, as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde, that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only.	1.4492026719688875
It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes, which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality, are devolved and repealed.	1.4164934364346662
If you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead, you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and, as we have heard today, you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament.	1.4366834546765825
Madam President, you spoke about fundamental political values, and one of the fundamental political values, even more important than democracy, is respect for others.	1.5960295057767953
We therefore feel that you acted correctly in sending a message and that perhaps those who protested about it are still feeling the effects of Bolshevism or Nazism. Democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong, but also listening to their explanations.	1.150587887290808
Enlargement - and Alleanza Nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this House - must not mean dilution, that is, it must not entail more risks.	1.4459664522236189
The applicant countries' hopes are at least as important as the hopes of our current fellow citizens, who are beginning to feel bitterly disappointed by the way Europe works, as it is not resolving the most serious problems.	1.3509261638513648
We therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be redrafted with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in Romania, reaching as far as Belgrade, but above all, the continuing spread of apathy as regards major security issues.	1.234575263043906
Even today, we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics.	1.1444151476778592
We therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement, so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions, with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur.	1.1706504506877509
I would also like to say a few words on Africa, Madam President.	0.91054147736242
The third and fourth worlds have been abandoned: just one dollar, one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children.	1.2366663016076422
Europe, which is so democratic, so progressive, does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board, while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases.	1.3419353416649302
One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation.	0.7777176449700117
Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification, just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm.	1.1095377271810898
The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few.	0.995938720006335
As for the Internet, Europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules.	1.5827147303639424
On a personal note, please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who, by acting the way they are, are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated.	1.42844571969182
We live in a world of rules and regulations: let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future.	1.1646285688453826
Madam President, as a Padanian taxpayer, I have already experienced the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Prodi, since Padania is liable to Italy for its taxes as well.	1.3807635210289886
Listening to him just now, I was concerned when he mentioned new resources, something that readily translates as additional taxation, in view, inter alia, of enlargement, that is the entry of new States into the Union.	1.4486854179399338
But why do they not buy their own entrance ticket?	0.7973855247196057
My Padanian electorate who, thanks to Mr Prodi, have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention, thanks once again to Mr Prodi, of paying another tax for someone else.	1.3820940755310451
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Members of the Commission, five months after its coming into office, the Commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the European Union.	1.3292042518206044
The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic.	0.7259752125928455
Is it not rather melodramatic to say that "the world looks up to Europe" ?	1.3647968786088103
Moreover, Europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen EU Member States.	1.3006555435859184
It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace, democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe, no less?	1.438891046445969
I am particularly intrigued by how the Commission considers bringing this about.	1.1652880619197237
Does "the European integration model as a rich source for global administration" imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power?	1.1409062832296264
According to the Commission, external policy can succeed, provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge!	1.3209103826676873
So who is this then?	0.6780366955750109
The Commission as a whole, its President perhaps, the Council?	1.4913611539217526
You stated that the new European government requires strong institutions, while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks.	1.370320054741463
We could not agree more with the latter.	0.5864995975133025
It is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross-border issues and stopped decking out the European cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities.	1.0490387182725258
The document mentions common values on different occasions.	0.6834050273114435
Unfortunately, I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking.	1.4669699295568654
This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on.	1.0047973691958456
I am convinced that the Bible, God' s word, is the only pure source of proper standards and real values.	1.114498255664349
In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition.	1.3116981796748428
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by: the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010?	1.185026516881
Have you already included your second term of office?	0.7789884952210165
But seriously.	-0.0
As it enlarges, the Union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation.	1.2908468521539211
First, streamlining.	0.8012017770790667
What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning.	1.4296217973231224
The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy.	1.1575321575768394
In other words, a social, ecologically-orientated market, a secure currency, guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally.	1.1893791894307395
It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important.	1.7737877926679595
Secondly, the new "in" word is flexibility.	1.4167735200023537
However, increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation.	1.2980578220448353
We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States.	0.8577564692814224
That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society, which is a welcome step.	1.0699080814561446
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers.	0.9961165205029807
(Applause)	-0.0
Transparency does not mean more access to more paper; to our citizens, transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg, when and with what right.	1.4013292931906567
That is transparency.	0.34442087788537745
Thirdly, the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly.	1.395440169839453
Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join, but by how many countries it can accommodate.	1.2667041164599981
(Applause)	-0.0
If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union, then it must not be paid.	1.4158790460589403
It is too high a price, not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union.	1.4139289944754114
There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone.	0.9285752063138575
But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies.	1.4800490157755204
That goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new, better quality of life.	1.0582195553654532
Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together.	1.740124666591785
In doing so, we need, no less, to reinvent the European Union, but without destroying the present Union.	1.508487354258401
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement.	1.4840004500296409
The Commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union as soon as possible.	1.1913487551989146
On the other hand, we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down.	1.0527401647196954
To avoid this the European Liberal Democrats have expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric Union, in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring.	1.305626753825826
It is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC.	1.5845903256471492
The subject needs to be discussed without prejudice.	0.9100077738578298
A technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough: we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by Jacques Delors, for example.	1.3393610948191936
In this way, a decision-making system can be created that is more effective, clearer, more open and more democratic.	1.140305680548854
I hope that the Commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding Union might implement its institutional and other differentiation.	1.1481403519092002
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, your inspiring speech, Mr Prodi, has quite won me over.	1.1688878852505997
It raises expectations, but it can also lead to disappointment.	1.2954050322781268
This is connected to what Mr Van Velzen was just saying, about the difference between words and deeds.	1.0838002568128593
The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace, security and stability.	1.2533031902557878
You are looking to reassure the acceding countries, as well as European opinion.	1.0841170510592124
But these days, we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes.	1.1103682720716086
We have noted increasing levels of apprehension and disquiet, even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high.	1.0303325037005064
We need to make our citizens feel at home, according to Mr Swoboda, and I agree.	1.6369021017938115
This is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility.	1.3220763004724287
This is probably linked to the standards mentioned by Mr Van Dam, namely subsidiarity.	1.3459236882270242
It is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners, rather than competitors when it comes to policy.	1.2848902846371861
It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens, where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves.	1.3663686354185602
That will require a new political culture, not only in words, but also in practice, which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions.	1.426269096548892
Regions which, culturally and economically, sometimes match the interest of some Member States.	1.0289751366980286
The new Europe should not only expand horizontally, but also vertically, by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community.	1.4927524696766363
This is what the Commission will be judged on.	1.400371201286355
Madam President, the Commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000-2005. These are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been glossed over to prevent any conflict.	1.356873573255564
So, in the first part on the new forms of European governance, the words 'federalism' and 'superstate' are not mentioned at all.	1.4075371856760752
Yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong European institutions in which only day-to-day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an indistinct whole. In this scenario the governments and national parliaments are merged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society, all of which are described, with no form of hierarchy, as 'integral elements of European governance' .	1.3209730787231349
These ambiguities mask many misunderstandings, primarily about our values.	0.837734087813582
It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat.	1.4461371763398938
It must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate, fair and transparent democratic debate, namely at national level in the main.	1.3342871797021885
Yet the whole of the Commission communication is based on the opposite theory. In this theory, on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples, their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations, new policies or new, restrictive legal structures such as the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.344111742394487
This Charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights.	0.9631900382577818
In the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principles are rather different.	0.8583815475543799
Clearly we want to defend the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations.	1.3184407913738379
This is not impossible.	1.2198309219189583
We must move away from the outmoded federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on European matters comes from the Memoires of Jean Monnet.	0.8649487341911924
Instead, we must open the European institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations.	1.3313107789528937
This is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication, Mr Prodi, but which is unfortunately not there.	1.552847638132536
Madam President, Mr Prodi, you claim to be shaping a new Europe yet you are lacking one basic element: confidence.	1.134980780845191
The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this.	0.8143653593070457
And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption?	0.8282510936482327
You are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty, insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency.	0.9732118700667306
You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders. Consequently, you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration.	1.1940019776260669
You are now proposing to give all decision-making power to a handful of officials. The Member States, local authorities and NGOs will simply become enforcers of decisions handed down from above, all on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels.	1.1959780329824046
Not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people.	1.0345110969994498
Clearly, they have no role to play in your strategy.	1.3506900784370595
You dare not even call a spade a spade, but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term 'governance' for what is nothing more than federal, autocratic, centralised government.	1.0166362609526367
Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty, you are now revealing your ultimate goal. You intend to trade in all European sovereignty, whether national or collective, for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position.	1.3822292209996918
Finally, you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians, or are allowing this to happen, just because the result does not suit you.	1.300014629184982
Yet at the same time you are supporting Communist China and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades.	1.1274088294617564
Members of this House are today speaking out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel which, quite obviously, is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre.	1.344123470519954
Your sabre-rattling fools no one because, as you know perfectly well, whether you like it or not, you need Austria in order to reform the Treaties and harmonise savings tax.	1.3219970789542062
You will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union.	1.1541322780355867
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this.	0.7997706963154129
The governments which, through spinelessness or ideology, support you are also responsible.	1.3268991479535808
Brussels is not all of us, as you claim. It is all of you.	1.639846422339461
Tell the truth for once. You could not care less what the people of Europe want.	1.26731204698159
They are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement.	0.8411668545976175
It is over ten years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the gulags and mollifying moralism.	0.878795336126938
We were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship.	0.7424214839103268
We are and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship. We call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous projects.	1.3326611961381454
The salvation of European democracies is with nation states. Europe' s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of Europe.	1.1340527545610888
(Limited applause)	0.3465662375340225
President Prodi, today you have presented the Commission' s five-year programme, and it has many objectives that we endorse.	1.4956485674347273
It is a programme based on real-life situations and issues, and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues.	1.3729041436983427
In my view, Mr Prodi, judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us, one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance, and that is solidarity, not so much at international level as at internal level.	1.4256551095890944
The Archbishop of Milan, Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini, is calling upon all politicians, in particular those like you and me, President Prodi, for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of Catholics in politics, to reconsider a development process, which, in addition to economic profit, takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account.	1.2974097627578243
It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up, one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone.	1.3341626723564894
It also reminds us of the need for a new growth model, one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the Catholics who are involved in social problems, who see, in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public, the most natural instruments for building solidarity.	1.3990383117462712
The fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom, which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced.	1.5193902657329381
This social freedom, which becomes manifest in initiatives favouring the poor, gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability.	1.325057269943795
Mr President, public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion.	1.5799069168954372
They must focus on service to people and commitment to achieving freedom for each individual, without forgetting, naturally, that all this cannot and must not conflict with the need to create business, to invest and risk, and in an ordered and focused system, entrepreneurs are able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity.	1.3669066556955087
In the age of globalisation, which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers, the European Commission cannot forget solidarity, and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man.	1.4388300995360976
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart.	0.8757211364857035
We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice.	1.1559079635699177
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, 'Shaping the new Europe' is an ambitious objective both for the Commission and for us all.	1.3875939183721122
Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries, but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union.	1.3669827710250644
What sort of impression will an interested public, as well as the rest of the world, have of this five-year programme?	1.1893795657753363
My reply would be: a new start, a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the Union in the 2000s will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously.	1.3316956493963286
The Commission is correct in stating that the Union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation.	1.2309228352619679
It foresees a just and more effective Europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self-interest.	0.9835531939661162
Consequently, we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom.	1.2205600655481779
I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document. However, there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work.	1.2534540699675507
The first concerns women, gender and women's rights.	1.1228161947878794
You talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth.	0.8256091740918036
That is important, but equality is not only necessary for productivity, but also to make our societies more democratic.	1.3795545277084669
It is therefore noticeable that 'equality', 'gender' and 'women' are barely mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'.	1.0602532538714207
You mentioned 'women' in your speech, but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals.	1.3466865159424002
Is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women?	1.401355079988284
What other explanation could there be for omitting women?	0.7003156259883648
The EU must not take on a masculine persona.	0.9527150130372191
My other question concerns Africa, which is the only continent not mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'.	1.021190530462117
Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world, the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic.	1.1570474082729356
I know that Commissioner Nielson and some of the other Commissioners are doing a fine job, but the rest of the Commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent, partly by including it among its strategic goals.	1.4918341510469284
Finally, I welcome the Commission's statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the EU is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets.	1.4441246086414576
I would merely ask when this is likely to take effect.	0.790757153212398
Madam President, President of the Commission, this is a vital document for the future and fate of Europe.	1.49214604475328
However, out of all the points, two specifically require our attention, and they are closely linked: peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe.	1.4326808592268843
It is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority.	0.9976642318508671
For some time, we have all agreed on this notion, but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement, even if this comes at a price.	1.4034323383178897
Today, we have been called on to choose, for the forthcoming decades, between a Europe that might be less prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more wealthy, but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring.	1.431693262570733
These goals will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference, which will draw to a close within the year, results in constitutional reform, providing the Commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement Council decisions or Parliament' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government.	1.3481814144489237
The first supporter of this reform should be Parliament itself, if it really wants to increase its role of interpreting the will of the Europeans and acquire the centrality which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated Union.	1.1658513707914575
Moreover, it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded.	1.4290913789435407
Without these prospects that we have outlined, Europe would, once again, have no future.	1.3486652396222787
Madam President, Mr Prodi, we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which Europe must overcome.	1.4298692813149212
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century.	1.2416404546613697
This event must underpin enlargement.	0.505515965556235
Rather than using the word 'enlargement' , I want to talk of reunification which has much greater political significance.	1.1670571283825797
Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks. This is one of the goals of your reform.	1.1313692022338644
In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity.	0.7441466226352121
Precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence.	1.163361732920872
However, saying is one thing and doing is another!	1.5431782513910945
You must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers.	1.0594662705022089
I will therefore judge you on your deeds.	0.9619297790619026
In the meantime, I approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication.	1.1683032063718366
However, I must make two essential points. These concern the simplification and application of Community law.	1.4109147969517972
In 1998, 123 referrals were made to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and 25% of environmental directives were not applied or transposed.	1.0172789358759098
Recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential.	1.0285693165376744
Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic.	1.1535491030238303
The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this.	1.1997131384117181
You are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us, including unemployment.	1.3513003533630183
Nevertheless, I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed.	1.4080409103855793
The emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility.	0.9945677565965668
You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society, not only economically but also in terms of public health.	1.1351162563870734
This is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication.	1.3199372272390075
Finally, you do highlight European research as being at the heart of our future.	1.4223788023015007
Yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this.	0.9447667649431798
Also, ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these.	1.0179411206550286
If you want to better inform the people, you should start by strengthening liaison with this House, as we are the representatives of the citizens.	1.3327515125332856
Madam President, we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-year programme and of the programme for 2000, set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning.	1.3645445849041715
In the two documents, strong emphasis is placed on the need to define new forms of European governance and, to this end, to introduce a new agenda for the Commission, establishing more stringent priorities in the pursuit of the goal of full employment, through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policies of the States, and, primarily - allow me to stress this - of the nations that have joined the monetary union and which must be enabled to become the first example of closer cooperation.	1.3185521698519265
To this end, I shall confine myself to stressing, out of all the choices available, the importance of three priority decisions which should, in the drawing-up of action programmes for the government of the Union, be the basis for both the Commission' s agenda and the actions of the European Union in the coming months.	1.4525386243004312
Firstly, the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors, with the backing of the European Investment Bank.	1.4187822824561742
Secondly, the approval of investments - where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries via Community projects in the priority sectors of research, innovation and training.	1.330719635919313
I feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature, resulting from investments in continuous training, refresher courses, adaptability and retraining of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives, that are always debatable, regarding new employment or employment cuts.	1.2608796426048323
If, among other things, as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well, the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue, focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge, in other words, a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules, this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes.	1.301536761326262
Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life.	1.2581016526917554
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, you have come here today, Mr Prodi, in a very reformist and ambitious mood.	1.445837134256595
I welcome you and your ambition.	0.7764180804499835
Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us.	1.1049381097367978
In order to make these reforms, however, and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme, we must be very sure, not only of the strengths of the reformer himself, but also of the opinions of others.	1.475797140584203
You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice.	1.4418539927357459
We have 1.27% of the Community' s GDP.	1.0440643882379574
Not a euro more or a euro less.	0.7746491951987654
It will not be us who refuse these new resources. You should ask the Council.	1.3104030194774212
These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre.	0.6973447079684104
In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans, we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4, and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget.	1.3764521527258307
I would remind you that this Group, the PPE-DE, does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones.	1.3074571086228446
The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs.	1.1621071502668168
Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system.	1.2902548512478413
It is all very well for us, by mutual consensus, to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation, but you must be very aware that the lack of resources, the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget, continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved.	1.4493801607185353
We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them.	1.2621416276732929
Madam President, the Commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever.	1.2653051191195717
On one hand, there are the words and, on the other, their real political meaning.	1.433109271857398
We Socialists applaud the Commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty.	1.135541750591362
Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled?	0.9530946575905748
What is meant by the Commission' s declared objective of 'economic reform' in the labour market?	1.1826250515320134
Does this mean more flexibility, insecurity and fixed-term contracts?	0.8059119458938987
Everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth.	1.07978191903168
The Union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient.	1.3093988040471898
We Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment.	0.6813516065032209
The ingredients of this policy are well known. They are the stimulation of public and private investment, increased investment in research, education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise.	1.2081279954570836
In this respect, the e-Europe initiative is to be welcomed.	1.0775211326578789
In the world of new technologies, the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are.	1.4124674253688252
The gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era.	1.054020030828011
On one hand we have the exuberance of the financial markets and the explosion of wealth and, on the other, more widespread exclusion.	1.423750104578307
We are asking workers to be flexible, innovative and ever more productive, yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone.	1.1046787645364515
The European Central Bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets, yet it never misses an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity.	1.0024061202112462
How do we explain to workers who fall victim to the rationalisations of the worldwide Monopoly game that they must be prepared to change career several times in their working lives when the captains of industry, having lost the gamble of a take-over, leave with compensation of EUR 30 million?	1.0468350808268294
For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised.	1.2276902754274526
The sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions, leading inevitably to monopoly situations.	0.9029597988441472
All these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15%, 20% or 25% which are unrealistic in the long term.	1.1080738731702926
The unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase.	1.0691768826196337
The main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets.	1.1205392182276552
To conclude, the next five years will be crucial.	1.2529040862634442
We need new rules to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people. We need the Member States and the Commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner.	1.5582557487787412
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, in my view, this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses.	1.1444127098912975
There is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one.	1.3204682472757339
I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy.	0.9575503450291212
You have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier, yet still you attach too little importance to these areas.	1.0512541911478104
And do you know why?	0.686293650746754
Just look at transport policy; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries.	1.055111460137055
I would be grateful if the President of the Commission would listen to what I have to say, although of course he has no obligation to do so.	1.4428827946592173
Let me give you three examples.	0.6624791941793353
First: we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the roads to the railways.	1.1707334257346456
That makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view.	1.0813957085830803
Without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy.	1.1024799970575454
The same applies to European air traffic control.	0.7923578914261786
Our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic, but leaving 15 different sectors in the skies which are under national control, which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which pollute the environment.	1.2894472343664527
You still have not finished that agenda.	0.7938983364939218
Commissioner, far too little is said in your paper about regional policy.	1.2250945572739484
Economic and social cohesion in the EU is a fundamental task of this Community.	1.5949671974547075
If we fail to complete it, citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement.	0.8991706933021038
We must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means.	1.0753142681064374
Then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it.	0.9624455654664188
Mr President of the Commission, if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions, then this Union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people.	1.3636013195383494
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage.	1.204078632148585
From that standpoint, it is useful that the Commission' s work programme comes back to the issues of Agenda 2000, the common agricultural policy, which includes fishing, and secondly, the activities of the structural funds.	1.5726701356321489
I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000.	1.18549632844713
The Agenda 2000 issues are, of course, ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives, the economic and social Agenda and a better quality of life.	1.1397398664039893
What your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major, high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deploy.	1.1514101482958594
I do not necessarily mean financial resources.	1.1043134299936492
The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money.	0.943663968919954
There must also be savings.	0.5516649902354746
But what we need is the analytical resources: these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital.	1.1614054392173951
This is because it is essential to achieve two things: the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured, and this must be done in a way which facilitates the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products, mainly to the benefit of developing countries.	1.3776398402362158
It is not easy to combine those aims. There is no obvious way.	1.2958118180629865
There may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them.	1.3243039670560168
As regards the other aspect of Agenda, the aspect of cohesion and regional development, there we do indeed have great achievements to point to, but there are still less developed regions, particularly island regions, to which more attention should be paid.	1.5923528199629082
As for fishing, there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the predatory exploitation of fishing grounds, which has gone as far as to wipe out entire species of fish, will certainly prove fruitful in the future.	1.3552043512400072
Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse.	0.8977594431277439
Madam President, I want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan.	1.1054727063681422
In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present.	1.157182697625979
That was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group, Mr Poettering, in his opening address.	1.3791696462771486
The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place.	1.0642923833708113
That foundation is clearly the single market.	0.8303877053833941
How strongly is the single market established at the moment?	1.0879336445960048
I want to remind Mr Prodi, and his colleagues who are still here, of the findings of the Commission' s own survey among 3000 European businesses.	1.5743108261578598
Nearly 40% of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications.	0.9506136173695522
This is the Commission' s own survey.	1.6776399057982945
These are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments - bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry.	0.996598374924632
The Commission' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market.	0.890874749636202
We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers, intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and, of course, extending into crucial new areas like financial services.	1.1736664349979404
Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved.	1.1324515468122422
An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union.	0.9048465451856906
The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement.	1.0596251998406485
I conclude by saying, on behalf of all my Conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task.	1.5087727135262656
Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today.	1.2884210042472375
The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme.	1.269709794479392
From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance, which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens.	1.3210751508516623
Yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate, if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority.	1.4387217393361222
The interlinking of the EU institutions, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well.	1.2763134384646913
Yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction?	0.9943109472749109
Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what' but more 'what are we doing together' ?	1.1032917585691713
It is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens.	0.8408797801379223
In your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us. I would add to these the future of our social model.	1.4550704017054092
This is why I and my group are so firmly insisting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.8490082638521204
The reason our timetable includes the drafting of this Charter is because we are at a key point in our history. Our Union needs to redefine the values on which it is based, both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire, but not under just any conditions.	1.3548572728073314
Our people expect more Europe, but not just any Europe.	1.2868161479774136
They are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather, on the basis of our social model, to be able to organise globalisation.	1.2332327652741086
In this respect I must say that, in terms of your commitment to a political union, to which we are favourable, this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model, on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world.	1.4973786055561862
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I should like to start with a quote: "The Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme.	1.2435974725288472
The Commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration. It wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime" .	1.366058214582198
That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security, freedom, citizens' rights and judicial cooperation.	1.3140076804469827
A paper this short is a farce.	0.6529762154653278
A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand.	1.254267035963444
A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard.	1.1392770626713815
It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard.	1.2349930931044566
We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme.	1.2054040527098961
What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand.	1.1671366280445594
We want instruments to prevent abuse.	0.6740758020138762
We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime.	1.34607113137045
We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper.	1.2948442419588755
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation, on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group. This is not the case in other areas, as has already been pointed out.	1.3774183592280194
We share these views because we are in favour of world trade, but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards, common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind. This aim is that trade should benefit development, and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world' s most dynamic and competitive regions.	1.4483557660556647
On the other hand, what does this statement tell us about principles?	1.1737101324079333
This regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation, in other words, increased wealth, but when we look at how this wealth is distributed, we see, unfortunately, that the gulf between the world' s richest countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase.	1.302580132370786
It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves, what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve?	1.288554239955082
What good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation works, if they cause trade to increase on the one hand, but on the other, they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow?	1.359472226608105
That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission outlined here for the Seattle negotiations and for later ones.	1.5352521722887769
We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious.	1.3037328397499326
We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations.	1.3223461274571007
Most importantly though, we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform, not just of the WTO but also of the ILO, the United Nations and above all, of the financial institutions, specifically the IMF and the World Bank.	1.521639299387844
We must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation. We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process, so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries, but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world.	1.452131387564859
Madam President, I would also like to welcome the Commission' s initiative of presenting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years, although I hope that it intends, in subsequent documents, to avoid the excess of generalisations and the vagueness of the text which we are examining today.	1.3772196277860902
Having said this, Madam President, I am prepared, once again, to be a voice crying in the wilderness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy.	1.3080216764748527
It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years, in view of the reform which must take place in 2002.	1.4261992097213188
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years.	1.3676236384000393
However, it seems that the Commission does not share this view, although it is the Commission which is obliged to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001, and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification.	1.656668465600225
In fact, the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions, such as the European Parliament, which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy.	1.213457238476549
We have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply.	1.288566812779332
Less than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is anomalous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such anomalies should be resolved within the framework of this reform process.	1.320236996672595
Therefore, Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I would ask that this issue, which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the European Union, be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years.	1.4063372214509784
Madam President, I should like to add my congratulations to Commissioner Prodi's programme.	1.2342074545088342
I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth: the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity, innovation enterprise, the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra-high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens.	1.1471796600481468
I have one observation, not a criticism, to make regarding Commissioner Prodi's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy.	1.5525528658565737
We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restructured.	1.4054780588054847
After all, what is social justice if it is without full employment?	1.202032418779225
Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens.	1.040061424348472
This is a key priority for us to focus on.	1.3094358010627647
I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us: in particular Commissioner Liikanen's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy.	1.4641815429072471
Yes, e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs.	1.308481261844703
I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses.	1.3315247621341881
That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit.	1.1577391946000988
I also welcome Commissioner Busquin's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union.	1.118154830836124
Again, this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity.	1.4611623392060484
You said in your summary, Commissioner Prodi, that liberalisation, competitiveness, keeping inflation low, innovation, science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs.	1.5114856479152088
I very much agree with you on that, but we can take nothing for granted.	1.5397838894356584
There is still more we have to do, and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that.	1.5931724547082926
So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success.	1.1909601093406323
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme.	1.164844196501883
To me, this Commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle.	1.4024013486329825
Unfortunately, it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission.	1.3279533582979817
As the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group, I would have expected more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission.	1.3040774124894363
The Commission gives no soul to Europe.	0.6969062433360897
Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper, despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe.	1.2064508929904465
Just a few main points.	0.6382784025850471
I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture; they create jobs.	1.204173336639052
I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas, about consolidating and improving the European dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning.	1.1182789099217025
Mr President of the Commission, it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe.	1.2640381246592003
Nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens.	0.9158975257603719
It seems to me that something is missing from this programme.	1.0313964706358643
Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real, visible area of training and culture.	0.9245789638063704
Declarations of principle are not enough.	0.6170505412477193
We need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just described.	1.395130201764699
Madam President, Mr Prodi, how would you take stock of your policy and work programme, what would your benchmark be, if you had to make direct choices?	1.447636738580858
You have the fine, charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections, or rather the turnout at the next European elections.	1.211337323082331
When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say?	1.5125512123839873
Mr Prodi, what can I say; what is there that is new?	1.2708401360981578
There is nothing new in your work programme.	1.0879683140383323
You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year' s work programme.	1.0570691209092717
Does that give me hope for the year 2000?	0.803849970561024
No, it does not!	1.2916537247916868
In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever.	0.8077148923883537
You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas.	1.0926052420271264
Have you done so, Mr Prodi; have you even read your work programme for the year?	1.2713177016105055
No, you have not done so.	1.4825942218378108
You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement, despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement.	1.2505689478678403
Nor have you integrated it into economic policy, competition or the internal market.	1.1200146847377221
You have not integrated it anywhere.	0.8669047362095398
You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure.	0.8782331983242571
You said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure; no, Mr Prodi, we need, at long last, to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored.	1.2552748767396207
You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation.	1.1522440302023544
Mr Prodi, you do not know what you are talking about.	1.2961305880808411
The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world.	1.2724194917873426
Where it falls short, what is missing, is transposition in the Member States and monitoring.	1.3913192502114593
It is time you took your job seriously, it is time for you, as President of the Commission, to box the Member States on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties.	1.4701213873307195
It is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day' s work to be done.	1.1906715599754512
That is what we expect of you in the next five years.	1.1582066547153533
.	-0.0
(ES) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, as chairman of this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries, Mr Prodi, you are not making things easy for me at all.	1.2530129528101217
I feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us.	1.076936015110373
The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change.	1.5350288405757724
I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing, since the silence of your programme, with regard to fishing, is deafening.	1.3806617616863415
Not a single line, nor a single word, refers to fishing or the CFP.	0.941001661909992
I am not asking for details or specific points, but I believe that a mention was required.	1.3468642874947285
How could you completely ignore a common - I repeat; common - policy with such an economic, social and regional impact, and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe?	1.4043722025857168
This is all the more serious, if that is possible - as others have said - bearing in mind that your Commission, Mr Prodi, has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy, which you are legally required to do in 2002.	1.5155313010708755
Does the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either?	1.1921687585087213
What message can we send to the fishermen of Europe, and their families, and the fishing industries, both the extractive and processing and marketing industries, and the related and secondary industries which depend on fishing in so many European ports, in so many European regions, in most cases peripheral regions, who rightly demand that this problem be dealt with as a priority?	1.510001896070834
You have made an explicit reference to the CAP for the coming years, but you have not done so for the CFP, with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context, in the context of globalisation.	1.4905322384332933
This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second.	1.528733410634593
I would therefore ask you, Mr Prodi, to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today.	1.3139556235267198
Our parliamentary Group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you.	1.197628852516122
Mr President of the Commission, this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament, a five-year programme following the crisis of the Commission.	1.3533213360842775
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to focus on the point of internal reform.	1.1914434516349872
We wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President, Mr Kinnock, on behalf of the Commission.	1.3541286634292953
We consider it to be of utmost importance that, in terms of financial control, personnel management and bureaucratic short-cuts, we can expect swift lines of policy and a more effective bureaucracy, for the benefit of the citizen.	1.3438204377855316
At the same time, we are aware that this is a massive programme and that, during the overhaul in the next couple of years, it will be necessary to keep the actual results coming in, as before.	1.3786185303883796
Much like in the Netherlands, where, at a given point, women woke up to the fact that, by referring to European legislation, they could improve their status in terms of social security, this is now also the case for scores of other citizens.	1.5361042986144882
They want to see results.	0.8966131366111664
Democracy, transparency and clarity always lead to results, citizens value results and this is what the Commission is judged on.	1.3533183273962057
This is exactly the point which Mr Swoboda and also other Members made: fear of modernisation, globalisation, and the individual losing his own sense of safety and security.	1.2201732271071482
This can be prevented if a European social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas.	1.1252096451108173
I would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which delivers fast and concrete results at a social level. This gives the citizen a sense of recognition, here in Europe and elsewhere.	1.2983969821585049
Because this citizen - one in five globally - still has no access to elementary social provisions, such as education and health care.	1.2711557089806682
These are really the people who deserve our solidarity.	1.100994672808221
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I have read and re-read the Commission' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office.	1.3590341271629836
I am delighted that it is being discussed in Parliament, but I also note the compromises and the omissions in it.	1.4428140671018286
The Commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion, to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union' s regional policy.	1.2144504387330133
And this is true even when it addresses the issue of enlargement.	1.3311536890886562
Are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved?	1.1659645260018296
Certainly not!	-0.0
At the same time, it was rightly pointed out that Europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with developing countries, and strengthen its activities designed for fighting poverty.	1.2197117266294535
This document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included.	0.9523632649711941
I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious.	1.2648273579047593
It plays down one of the Treaties' principles - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the European institutions' policies and measures. It seems to ignore the fact that various European regions are still considerably less advanced than others.	1.675903433175606
It also forgets that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right. Unless we achieve real convergence, the cohesion of the European Union itself will be at risk.	1.4232335307738029
We should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union, for which the Commission is responsible.	1.4795847019611448
This report confirms that whereas an average level of development is given a rating of 100, the ten so-called "strongest" regions reached an average of 158, and the ten so-called "weakest" regions reached a figure of around 50.	1.0811186571401754
You may draw your own conclusions.	0.6855357054506551
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region, the Azores, one of the regions defined in the Treaties as ultra-peripheral.	1.3135106390588354
I am waiting for the Commission' s report on the ultra-peripheral regions, which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999.	1.327508157803436
I shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion, there will be no cohesion at all, only disunity.	1.1611115010930257
Madam President, Mr Prodi, Europe needs a strong Commission.	1.2145911979996507
As intended by the Treaties and the will of the people, the Commission is the driving force of European construction which is like a rock of Sisyphus which we have to push back up to the summit again together after each round of enlargement. We therefore need a strong Commission but one which relies on the support of a parliament.	1.3970990392313465
This House is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommodating. You must therefore listen to our opinions, one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech.	1.360035984900643
Firstly, Mr President, although your two predecessors concentrated on developing an internal market and establishing the single currency, it has been left to you to develop this whole value of citizenship which is at the heart of European construction.	1.4347319342527576
You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement, however important this may be.	1.2383288890427318
You must go further, towards reconciling the people with Europe, in particular those people who are falling victim to economic, social and, probably, in the future, technological divisions.	1.4670174958712618
The promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition. The latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health, education, transport, communications, water and whatever else.	1.2512745538068752
Your action programme and your objectives are reserved, even silent, specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed.	1.2240321834011054
This is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services.	1.2320841677936012
This is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than Jörg Haider.	1.4372205246654217
Madam President, the Commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities.	1.3166285811755138
The recent dioxin scare in Belgium, prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain, and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically-modified foods, have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat.	1.2523617929510538
If the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of EU citizens.	1.2722557277979039
I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety, public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the Commission's work programme for 2000.	1.2583432286704994
However, I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper.	1.4600853762880428
In its present form, what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision- and law-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration, which has already established credibility in this particular field.	1.4347720892061129
Furthermore, future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States, for example the food safety authority in Ireland.	1.3254742063037317
This body, for example, alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety, is already doing good work.	1.1531752609240773
It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation.	0.9863970248547445
My fear is that such deficiencies in EU legislation could lead to turf wars between national and EU bodies, who should be working together rather than against one another.	1.1393446055492729
That is something we must guard against.	0.9483640379440633
Madam President, the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair.	1.0701390711552337
We will be looking for the detail year by year, for example in the social action programme to be unveiled this year.	1.3680816078833087
We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy, and will be applying a number of tests.	1.3815318696076677
We will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combining economic policy, employment policy and social policy.	1.2216697343184795
At the moment, social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy.	1.1394194183274728
Within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the Portuguese Presidency.	1.230544279649907
Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect.	1.3408794828926858
The spate of mergers, takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive.	1.3538949728709997
We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change.	1.0730897785512568
That is the successful way to manage change, and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place.	1.4938116193951883
Finally, with the emergence, the resurgence, of the xenophobic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination, and Article 137 to combat exclusion.	1.5571429120545497
We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now.	1.0813986333348466
The aspirations are fine, President Prodi, we want those aspirations to be matched by action.	1.1960948242227478
Madam President, I hope that it is a good omen that there are still a few i's left for me to dot.	1.5192245486314802
Mr Prodi, you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forward-looking employment policy throughout Europe.	1.0159521027187821
However, for the economic sector which I represent, i.e. fisheries, this means change.	1.7107443233200226
We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility.	1.1527581932503808
We must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry.	0.9668802618961021
What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing.	1.2580641999152289
However, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor, which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe.	1.3811090188960784
Plus, this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which Europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act, which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too.	1.4405710441822621
This has since been unanimously approved.	0.6151021299126598
The fisheries policy is due for review in a few months' time, i.e. at the beginning of the year 2000.	1.2235056691104014
So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper.	1.2997090756673222
I hope that this is a misunderstanding.	1.5827945313762453
Please, Mr Prodi, stand by your word and implement your promises.	1.0392982201556393
Madam President, many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission' s statement.	1.4050177205808672
However, we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission.	1.5435994057176559
One area that I want to focus on, in addition to those already identified, is that of cultural diversity in Europe.	1.4237430382246905
The introduction to this statement acknowledges under the quality of life section that it is important.	1.2766697726591738
But there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the Commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity.	1.2228598290467187
If we are to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other, both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and, indeed, among those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe.	1.3304918307779892
Unless we address these issues, unless we dismantle these negative stereotypes, unless we take what is best from our various cultures and languages and protect and expand it and ensure that we are serious about having a diverse Europe, we will fail.	1.2543726844814578
Those who are currently coming to the fore in Europe based on fear will win the day.	0.9561103823564788
I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe, we will make progress on the economic front, on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy, but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand.	1.3763413421370765
If we do not take steps to deal with that, we will fail ultimately.	1.4560978184943238
Thank you, Mr De Rossa.	1.1671091094264647
Before giving the floor again to the President of the Commission, I must tell you that I have received, pursuant to Rule 37, seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate.	1.310390575981731
Welcome	-0.0
I would like to inform you that there is a delegation from Kuwait, led by His Excellency, Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah, Vice-Prime Minister and Defence Minister, here in the official gallery.	1.1236938798859275
On behalf of the House, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament.	1.5237199098230156
Mr President, I should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activities organised today by the Association of Parliamentary Assistants in support of their call for a statute for assistants to be adopted as soon as possible.	1.240997990575069
I understand that on 26 January the association wrote to the College of Quaestors requesting permission to set up a table outside the Hemicycle today to publicise their initiative.	1.00168282499249
On the same day, I understand, Mr Balfe gave permission for the assistants to go ahead.	1.3400683302782928
The Parliament services asked to meet with the assistants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements.	1.1050689245410692
However, the appointment was cancelled at the last minute.	1.3088580560600656
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn.	0.8149669952160552
Mrs Banotti apparently promised to write a letter explaining why permission was withdrawn but so far no letter has been received.	0.8398954890627149
Can you explain why the approval given to the assistants was withdrawn at the last minute?	1.0423899122373874
Do you agree that the assistants have a legitimate case which must be heard?	0.9216253456787168
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last-minute cancellations do not happen again?	0.8401311876932279
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible?	1.019394177338762
Finally, will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament's rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid, as they should be, on the basis of all the work they do for us?	1.650937878137941
Without them we would not be able to function.	1.2310394369036284
Mr President, I also rise on a point of order.	1.07913950991094
Are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this Parliament, outside the doors of the Hemicycle, to ensure that MEPs are free to come into this Hemicycle to discharge their mandate?	1.1391124105250565
If there are such rules, who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility?	1.2185653755661725
Mr President, I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants, which we have always considered to be a priority, and inform you that - as the Italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader, Mr Barón Crespo, we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the Quaestors.	1.585368256777995
I think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway.	1.4237857808529126
I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise.	1.225231611164356
Mr President, first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants.	1.4347358781944453
Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament.	0.9147093496755128
As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament.	1.291693741074149
To give a non-contentious example, no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons.	1.274001984024804
Following a letter I received yesterday, I immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration, probably in the near future and possibly in the next month.	1.3883950554740885
But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament.	1.0513848597619169
I signed a letter yesterday afternoon, in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament, in which the assistants were informed of this.	1.368977978216591
But I am also told that they were informed verbally of this decision by the Committee of Chairmen of Groups last Thursday, so they were fully aware of the decision.	1.34962461986185
There is no problem with them telling us the way they feel, there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament's next part-session.	1.1812912533402118
But there was some misunderstanding, for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission.	1.161758890299231
But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee.	0.9995845215939094
As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament, whether they be about different countries or whatever.	1.2061099517424618
This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants.	1.3365006433874915
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.	1.1539592856909675
I think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised.	0.8277298041558806
Mr President, I wanted to point out an important matter of principle.	1.3882722394484446
I personally believe that it is nothing short of scandalous that we hear Members of this Parliament attacking the demonstration rather than looking at the solution to the problem, which is fair conditions, fair pay and fair hours.	1.213144781790571
We shall now proceed to the vote.1	0.5917796487202113
VOTE	-0.0
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party, the delegation of the Spanish People' s Party, with regard to Mrs Terrón i Cusí' s resolution on the area of freedom, security and justice.	1.0487970919184126
There have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the Group of the European People' s Party, and we have voted in favour of the Terrón i Cusí resolution, which we consider on the whole to be excellent.	1.3639851861855279
However, we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6, because they seem to us to be legally incorrect.	1.4307434594383108
On the other hand, we have voted in favour of Recital J which, in fact, is in line with what I, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, proposed to that Committee, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2816530312748526
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13.	0.8450424386317108
An appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non-EU countries is something which the Spanish People' s Party has been advocating for some time.	1.1914716440045061
For similar reasons, we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which, with the oral amendment, dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity, since political rights, not just voting in local elections, but political rights in general terms, form part of the sovereignty of Member States.	1.2766625295953327
Given the oral amendment, we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done.	1.6397911456356753
.	-0.0
(DA) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the proposed resolution, but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas clash with the reservation Denmark has in the legal sphere - a reservation which the Danish delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists naturally wishes to respect.	1.352120066699177
This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with 'communitisation' or the consolidation of Fortress Europe.	1.022411096555716
The supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants.	1.0328597227070373
In terms of human rights, this is a backward step.	1.123925543348183
Europe is continuing to expel nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Yet some applicant countries in central and eastern Europe are taking in gypsy refugees expelled en masse from Belgium.	1.1256900399891534
Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status, whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution.	0.8828268421834095
The Europe of Schengen clearly finds it much easier to hound the persecuted from the south than dictators, even though the UN estimates that we will need 159 million immigrants to maintain a stable population between now and the year 2025.	1.1253331713069468
Europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections. Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice.	1.2766234511971764
McCarthy report (A5-0026/2000)	1.0359470257236734
Mr President, I would firstly like to point out that I was Mayor of Bilbao during the nineties, which gave me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot projects to be subsidised by the Commission.	1.2516125104584694
Our experience with that pilot project in Bilbao led us to four conclusions: firstly, that Europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore, far from reducing the EUR 900 million for the last five year period to EUR 700 million for this five year period, the funding of this project should be increased. This should be done, for example - and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has proposed this - by reinvesting, in URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which each Member State has not spent within the time scales laid down for that purpose.	1.3789493213872284
Secondly, when deciding which areas must be subsidised, we must concentrate efforts on integrated projects.	1.5128575967851015
Disparate actions are not effective.	0.644085816254555
We have to select locations by prioritising those which are most impoverished and needy, in accordance with the objectives set, that is to say, the social, economic, environmental and democratic management dimensions, as well as the relationship between them.	1.3151210436678986
Thirdly, we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other Community programmes, as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question.	1.272880148542286
Finally, we have to put our trust in, and support, the institutions which are closest to the citizens, that is, the local councils and bodies.	1.5977962015292517
They have more first-hand knowledge of social needs. They have more involvement in the problems and, furthermore, they know how to conceive projects and implement them effectively without weighing them down with bureaucracy, and thereby achieve better results.	1.38861031177062
Lastly, in today' s vote on our four amendments, two have been approved and the other two rejected.	1.5555810615661991
This has obliged us to abstain from the final vote, because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedicate, to URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which it has not spent in accordance with Community programmes.	1.299334997700142
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had an in-depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produced many ideas.	1.1005324297048225
As the smallest Community initiative in existence, we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected.	1.271872586701688
We regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects. We should remember that it is these URBAN projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established.	1.315557375751626
The Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place. It should make URBAN projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled 'sustainable urban policy' .	1.3683449585998517
Finally, there is currently still no European urban policy within the European Union. Perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reorganisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally has a true urban policy.	1.42204488017849
Mr President, I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development, known as URBAN.	1.1723130465172418
As with all other Community initiatives, this is very positive.	1.4545163420655371
Europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State, whichever one it may be.	1.2935520291310625
URBAN is designed to find solutions to urban decay, and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pensioners' Party.	1.176646908216053
There can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city.	0.9462376434651594
I hope that this Community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities.	1.127094056763669
. (DA) The Left' s five Members of the European Parliament have chosen to support LEADER+, the EQUAL initiative and INTERREG, but not URBAN.	1.3340705676721634
At a forthcoming review of these programmes, it ought to be established that the EU' s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross-border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the EU.	1.3765316710498592
. (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for a Community initiative relating to the economic and social regeneration of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis and designed to promote sustainable development (URBAN).	1.0290906590940512
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think, in general, that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations, as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects.	1.296565640958588
This report contains general points on what is referred to as the urban regeneration strategy for town centres and neighbourhoods affected by the crisis in the capitalist economy and its consequences, i.e. increasing unemployment, exclusion and delinquency.	1.0870636890967225
It underlines the fact that, in order to ensure sustainable urban development, an urban policy must be implemented which does not leave out the main victims of the economic crisis, namely the unemployed, immigrants, refugees, women and the socially excluded.	1.3263601262571865
However, nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it.	1.4023049587038035
At best this report simply corrects certain aspects and effects of the crisis. Yet only scandalously limited resources are available for this work.	1.1170932959794142
As the report itself indicates, the funds allocated to the URBAN II programme for the 2000-2006 period are approximately 30% less than those in the previous period, which were already low, at EUR 900 million. Added to this is the fact that only about fifty projects are considered for the whole of Europe which is pathetic when practically all European city districts, both suburban and inner city, are affected.	1.3852902103797888
This is why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measures planned to help certain social categories which are most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consists of pious hopes financed on the cheap.	1.296273071539783
- (FR) Mrs McCarthy, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that the URBAN Community Initiative is being continued as this aims to support the social and economic conversion of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis, all with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	1.0667055986744278
With some 80% of the population of Europe living in an urban area, cities are at the forefront of economic, social and cultural change in Europe.	1.1086145110857442
At the same time, the social and economic problems facing European society are more pronounced in urban areas.	1.0006634275259922
Many European cities are divided into neighbourhoods characterised by high-added-value activities and high-income residents and other districts characterised by low incomes, high unemployment, substandard and overcrowded housing and high levels of welfare dependency.	0.9587273036877264
The concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved.	1.0285704622982836
This is why the European Parliament successfully called for the URBAN Community Initiative or CIP to be extended during the reform of the Structural Funds.	1.249257911225072
The success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period is indisputable.	0.7716254418485119
The results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas.	1.2755329987515605
This CIP has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic, social and environmental sectors.	0.9932314631354249
It has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities, the non-governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration.	1.2132981489890884
The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them, while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups.	1.0860826097075134
We can therefore welcome its adoption.	0.8435404768248517
We must, however, admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory!	1.0145125640680455
The total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge.	0.8859570701653741
The amount for the 1994-1999 period was EUR 900 million and will be EUR 700 million for the 2000-2006 period. This represents a drop of 30%!	0.9896865470398607
This reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new URBAN initiative.	1.0538970851442417
The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low.	0.6544427886091093
It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States.	0.908542770446549
In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects, the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect.	1.3467242188510296
The McCarthy report on the URBAN Community Initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in urban matters.	1.0723572739577134
The situation of certain urban areas is alarming, with the social distress taking the form of unemployment, misery and crime.	1.1938539687892957
Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency.	0.6565320041567814
Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt.	1.1851187682215387
Subsidiarity should make us realise that the state, exercising its governing functions, and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately. The state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people.	1.319236076356089
Although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchanges between successful enterprises, the problems specific to each urban area cannot be dealt with in the same way.	1.0890339046010342
The URBAN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union' s desire to communitise urban policy.	1.1908557156842916
It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-existing European policies.	1.3366931365928265
Clearly some people are profiting from the opportunity to indulge in another budget bidding race which is particularly mistimed when the convergence criteria for EMU are imposing a very strict slimming regime on the national budgets.	0.9536363079358241
Mrs McCarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extolling the benefits of a federal Europe.	1.0338312345204597
We should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project.	0.9024265214664718
In fact, the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted.	1.0380530918097879
The aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility.	1.246534816547447
Finally, the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or sociological minorities.	1.3380560989285761
We can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion.	1.0576676950506103
On one hand, this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their assimilation into the culture of the host country. This would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder kegs.	1.3219052072042417
On the other hand, it manipulates the principle of positive discrimination. This is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful, as shown by the US precedent.	1.3575104249495693
For all these reasons, the French delegation of the UEN Group could not approve the McCarthy report.	1.0629976233888376
Decourrière report (A5-0028/2000)	0.9662670294494407
Mr President, the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts.	1.366291404710284
Like many of my colleagues, I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to safeguard this initiative.	1.433361096295211
As I live in the Sarre-Lor-Lux Sud region of Belgium, I am well aware that the regions are where Europe is being created. They are where we live the European experience on a daily basis and where the people make European construction come alive.	1.2621763752169273
These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development.	0.9502064663509738
Why am I stressing this point?	0.5665568992615357
The answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted.	1.2865990532596798
For example, to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the European Union. This goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions, for example.	1.3467789120678553
I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the EU' s policy is integrated into the projects submitted and that the goal of reducing CO2 for example forms an experimental added value in the projects proposed.	1.206264538032145
I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction.	1.3480540054110752
We know that some Member States are still wavering, for example, between rail and road for routes through vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees, as in the Aspe valley.	1.3096458722651274
However, I am also thinking of my own region where my government is still debating whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway, the A32.	1.3442787396321605
In this respect too, I would ask the Commission to be particularly attentive about ensuring that there is real cohesion between the various policies, specifically in the INTERREG programmes which are being submitted.	1.4817995412741827
Mr President, I voted for the Decourrière report on the Community initiative INTERREG, mainly because of the reply Commissioner Barnier gave to some Members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime frontiers. I voted for it, not just because I was born in a coastal town, Genoa, but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too.	1.2672174051023586
These frontiers stretch as far as African states and the Middle East: we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of Europe.	1.387256702106602
As an MEP from a border region, I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest.	1.3410528126954802
We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically, socially and culturally.	1.0940789484698383
Due to the existence of these borders, they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong. This has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy.	1.303057674123887
This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990.	1.146614095365391
This programme was designed to encourage cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union.	1.1285363008583706
INTERREG serves principally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs, education and training, cultural exchanges, action to combat health problems, the protection and improvement of the environment, energy, transport and telecommunications networks.	1.2021117662430234
I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration.	0.9798350482230838
More active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be promoted, bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border.	1.2105693240405138
In cross-border cooperation, greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators.	1.1696475747880948
In the same respect, given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50% of all unemployment, the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment.	1.4006647699343384
Obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing, braking or hindering cross-border mobility.	0.9223799106424365
I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region!	1.475789874795169
INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area.	1.0683432923669307
Finally, and in particular, expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTERREG!	1.2981308954802473
The challenges are therefore immense. The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy!	1.409300736440587
I hope everyone, like Mr Decourrière, whom I congratulate, will realise this!	1.2694079370369478
- (FR) The INTERREG Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy.	1.1363337633446837
This apparently generous policy, officially intended to help problem regions, is a fool' s bargain for French taxpayers.	1.1353756875077012
France contributes 17% of the European budget yet will receive only 8% of the regional Structural Funds.	1.4933581272275427
Between 1994 and 1999, our regions annually received an average of FF 15.4 billion but will receive only FF 14.7 billion between 2000 and 2006.	1.001431284106658
My region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be particularly affected with French Hainaut losing the aid paid to Objective 1 regions.	0.8985502680792508
This loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free-trade Europe.	0.9503011290482263
The European regional policy also reinforces the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds.	1.0313277933202303
This is a Europe of regions in which the regions, which are weaker than the nation states, will easily submit to Brussels.	1.58314279374796
The INTERREG initiative, launched in 1990 to prepare the border regions for a Europe without borders and therefore without nations, sits comfortably within this philosophy.	1.1074406272433965
However, Mr Decourrière does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the Brussels technocrats.	1.2982884382322708
These failings will result in particular in the late implementation of INTERREG III and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid.	1.124962593090675
We also agree with the rapporteur about asking for more attention to be paid to small and medium-sized undertakings and, of course, about refusing to use outside service providers.	1.1770329893275218
These are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous Commission.	1.0950321127989766
However, these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted, in no way remedy the Eurofederalist philosophy which characterises the Community initiatives, particularly INTERREG.	1.4332485043411436
This is why the National Front voted against the report.	1.2129167068233422
The European Parliament has delivered an opinion on the Commission guidelines for the INTERREG Community Initiative concerning cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.	1.1597093089795891
I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative.	1.1393876868129955
This does not involve the concerns about the future of the Atlantic Arc but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand A on cross-border cooperation.	1.183696572879241
In the Commission guidelines, few maritime areas are eligible for INTERREG IIIA. The amendments to the Decourrière report aim to make INTERREG more maritime-oriented.	1.124159242774259
This is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the EU which is at stake.	1.6227249215930215
I am aware of the Commission' s reluctance on this subject as it announced during the symposium on the presentation of INTERREG III last November.	1.1429812189838848
However, I must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to denying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation.	1.2741919566852833
One example of this is the 'Celtic' area which encompasses the territories of Brittany in France, Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom and Cork and Waterford in Ireland. This is an area whose locally-based economy is characterised by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri-foodstuffs sector.	1.2030504890581422
It also has excellent cultural and relational links, through twinnings for example. INTERREG III, strand A, would allow the regions in this area to advance a number of structural projects needed to develop small and medium-sized undertakings and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer.	1.373589941811872
The European Commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions.	1.128510380941141
This policy would have important economic consequences for the fishing industry in Brittany in that catches could be unloaded at Irish advance bases in order to then be transported to the Breton agri-foodstuffs industry.	0.9611243773825372
The integration of the maritime border into strand A would finally allow the western periphery to be recognised as a unique and important economic area which is confronted by the 'continentalisation' of the European Union.	1.005861411659424
This would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east.	0.9968098646936556
The maritime world has great potential.	0.5125668016957466
We therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be defined.	1.1389359705391606
. (DA) The European project began as a partnership between States.	1.2321639984888426
This partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of Europe for over 50 years.	1.137043216052133
As a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world, of which the EU is just one proof, and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our Western values, competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades.	1.5472783278267215
The EU should be prepared to meet that competition.	0.9545210738606198
We can only do that by intensifying co-operation within the Community.	1.0309195747694118
It should not be about greater integration of the EU countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders.	1.277991980214695
It is about co-operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides.	0.9584752964359782
A programme such as INTERREG is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders, projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale.	1.2204216909133911
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme.	0.9840560781550588
. (FR) Mr Decourrière' s report is not without merit: at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the INTERREG initiative and its role in opening up border regions, it comes out in favour of SMEs in paragraph 16.	1.4233127524329465
I and my colleague Dominique Souchet, who is well versed in this matter, have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of SMEs and craft trades within the framework of INTERREG, the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and I welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously.	1.3675291601535624
Nonetheless, the French delegation in our group was unable to accept the fact that the Commission and the federalist faction have diverted the INTERREG initiative from its original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nations.	1.2909370650496095
We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States, as suggested in recital of the report.	1.3241721635365735
We only ask one thing of the Commission: that it confine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not upset the balance of regional planning in our territories.	1.32998144384502
The destructive effects of the CAP and EMU on the balance between regions, especially on the vitality of the more rural, the more remote and the least populated regions, is proof positive of the fact that such ambitions are not a sinecure, far from it.	1.358994976046316
We are therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encouraging interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sidelining the Member States.	1.4300493791468953
This infatuation with strand IIIC is all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledges in his explanatory statement that 'the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co-operation' (p.17) and that 'the responsibilities are diffuse and vague' (p.18).	1.2179331859450169
Calling under these circumstances, as he does in paragraph 20, for the budget for this strand to be increased is another example of the irresponsible and ideological outbidding tactics which are customary in this House.	1.2501495298894114
Lastly, there is the desire expressed both in the Commission document and Mr Decourrière' s report of using INTERREG for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans: I do not think that the Structural Funds should be used to repair the damage which the Americans inflicted on Serbia during bombardments which were as criminal as they were ineffectual.	1.4021346324436783
It is up to Washington, not us, to assume responsibility for a conflict which was triggered merely to serve its interests.	1.3464840709065864
The French delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the Decourrière report and will choose to abstain during the final vote.	1.0089620728286854
Procacci report (A5-0025/2000)	0.6794731859891275
Mr President, I voted for the Procacci report on rural development, not only because I endorse the major policy lines of the LEADER programme, but also because it complements the URBAN programme, which I spoke about earlier.	1.3494221575385261
Just as elderly people in cities are very isolated, so the elderly are fast becoming the sole inhabitants of rural areas because young people are moving to the cities: they are drawn by the bright lights, and the pubs, and the countryside and rural areas are being emptied.	1.4140146687257946
I therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this European Union plan and for it to be further developed.	1.1246042816652808
- (PT) Although this Community initiative, LEADER +, follows on from previous initiatives, it has some unique features.	1.3222322058895974
One of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period.	1.1265914897681517
Nevertheless, new objectives have been included, specifically the financing of the Nature Network 2000, for which all rural regions will be eligible.	1.543447603687801
In spite of the fact that this Community initiative is aimed at rural development, it does not address the issues of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way, and this is unacceptable.	1.323888548663286
Without agriculture, the rural world will disappear.	1.143256022567217
This means that any strategy for rural development must be based on agriculture' s internal potential while at the same time developing as many other activities as possible in order to prevent the desertification of the rural world.	1.202388644165063
This is why we considered it essential to improve the report by means of our proposals deliberately to include agricultural activity and farmers in the strategy for rural development and to request more appropriations in order not to threaten the survival of the programme in those rural regions which were covered before. We also want to ensure that the new programme continues to prioritise the less-favoured regions.	1.3050154379348773
Our position on LEADER is a product of our more general assessment of the EU' s overall agricultural policy.	1.1356106431466675
Both LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, which were implemented in the 1990s, were ingredients of the new CAP that emerged after its review in 1992 and, along with other respective measures, they constituted the so-termed second pillar of the EU' s rural development policy.	1.3311584598858168
Their real aim was to moderate and disguise the new CAP' s disastrous consequences and the disorientation of small and medium-scale farmers, and not to develop the rural areas or retain the agricultural population therein as was hypocritically declared in their objectives.	1.0737343888157385
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented, farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly, which resulted in their depopulation.	1.2213232593912524
A characteristic example is Greece, which as an Objective 1 country was included as a whole in the LEADER Community initiatives, and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2.3%, while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decreased by 15.2%.	1.278805995231199
We think LEADER + will be even more ineffectual than LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, for the following reasons.	0.9604970608473483
The real aims of LEADER + are the same as those of LEADERs 1 and 2, in other words to moderate and disguise the negative consequences of the CAP to be implemented in the context of Agenda 2000 and the WTO.	1.2975190689489158
The present CAP, however, is worse than its predecessor and it also starts from a worse basis, granted that the 1992 CAP review and the GATT agreement in 1995 have created serious problems and impasses for the agricultural economy.	1.1392959887130292
The selection criteria and the activities that are subsidised under LEADER do, in the best case, moderate some partial problems of the countryside, which are of secondary importance, but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and pandering to conscience.	1.4054015637602404
In no case, however, are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature.	1.3251662734727536
The actual appropriations available for LEADER + compared with LEADER 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15% (from EUR 1 775 million for LEADER 2 to EUR 2 020 million for LEADER +).	1.0567244849199942
This is because the 15% increase is nominal and not real, granted that average yearly inflation in the Community during those years was approximately 2%.	1.0464778636483092
LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2.	0.8303959092147785
LEADER + can cover all the regions of the EU, while LEADER 2 covered only the Objective 1 regions and some Objective 5b and 6 regions.	1.1962069271233506
We must point out, however, that even if the actual appropriations available for LEADER + were increased, the Community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the anti-farming nature of the CAP that will be implemented in the context of 'Agenda 2000' and the WTO. The real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover-up, to lead people off the scent and to salve consciences.	1.3114253818322508
We disagree with many of the report' s views.	1.1399657556137515
Once more, we point to the negative changes of the CAP (1992 - Agenda 2000).	1.3585716557000234
We do not think LEADER + will contribute substantively towards solving the countryside' s problems, which are characterised by the decline of farming, which was and should remain the countryside' s basic social and economic branch.	1.3813475051418456
For our part, we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes.	1.1069839711771101
We will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wasted, and most important of all, we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous CAP which is disinheriting them and leading them towards economic decline and the desertion of the countryside.	1.2200651908019864
Unless this CAP is overthrown, no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside.	1.09508382658733
All the Members in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted in favour of almost the whole of the Procacci report on the LEADER + Community Initiative.	1.1089956633625626
However, we amended the draft report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain points which will make this Community initiative more effective.	1.3341685557323248
In particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the LEADER II initiative.	1.0430085050621367
It was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LEADER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density.	1.1856057342860553
Amendment No 10 which I tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of 'economic and social cohesion' rather than 'regional development' as the European Union does not have any recognised competence in this area.	1.309045428918499
Amendment No 11 replaces 'government or municipal officials' with 'government officials' .	0.886483373160243
Although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio-economic sectors of the territory concerned, government officials must be involved at decision-making level, whether they come from the municipalities, departments, regions or national governments.	1.226312418659307
The rapporteur' s phrasing was therefore too limiting.	0.7563136083778735
Amendment No 12 responds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of this House.	0.886501193050874
It specifies the necessary coordination between LEADER + and Community cooperation and partnership programmes such as INTERREG, PHARE, Sapard or MEDA.	0.7151326712776964
In the territory of Member States of the European Union, applicant countries or Member States of EFTA, there may be interrelations between the various Community initiatives.	1.3454169424536966
The real priority for the European continent is to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur.	1.3625965795407242
The creation of organisations similar to the LAGs may be usefully encouraged by the European Union, provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners.	1.123055302849257
In essence, we are, of course, in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative.	1.2621353343085808
The conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric, including infrastructure, public and private services and so on.	1.0555602184672115
In this context, in committee we regretted the paltry funding allotted to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increased budget for this Community initiative so that it matches the previous LEADER I and LEADER II initiatives.	1.1949157868047207
The budget allocated to LEADER + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to LEADER II for a period of six years.	0.9042267241280371
This is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements.	1.2718727106975303
Finally, among the priority parameters to be introduced at European level to enable local involvement, particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been implemented by LAGs within the LEADER II initiative, but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified.	1.343898897417226
(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	0.497633973896566
Additives in feedingstuffs	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0015/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (COM(1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS)).	0.7165199090507574
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, under Directive 70/524, high-technology additives are treated differently, depending on the date of authorisation.	1.159185642374574
The Commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances licensed before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now.	1.045554557882157
As far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned, so far so good.	1.3929191401873355
However, the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics, drugs, growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms.	1.0440282626440256
That makes it a question of health, not just approximating laws, which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article 37 - is not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 152, that is to say with codecision by Parliament.	1.5765431537482937
We asked the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which pointed out that, as far as approximating laws is concerned, Article 37 is adequate in this case.	1.149003487108779
However, we in the Committee on Agriculture have not confined ourselves to approximating laws; because this proposal also encompasses genetically-modified organisms, we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health.	1.4098567375035964
We negotiated with the Commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of genetically-modified organisms in the directive, taking the text on which Directive 70/524 is based as a starting point.	1.2041533126615052
Mr Byrne, we fail to understand why the Commission is not approximating the text on genetically-modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work.	1.4601628994683333
We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text.	1.1794977339039467
Moreover, this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well.	1.3835000352297508
The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future.	0.9991721975678609
However, that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives.	1.4273990516187263
We are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically-modified organisms.	1.1416630238765304
Directive 70/524 still contains the old text because the seed directive was submitted to Parliament in 1986 and we then negotiated with the Commission until 1988, while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994 and Parliament obviously did not accord genetically-modified organisms the same importance then as it did later when I was rapporteur.	1.2764765374287892
We therefore assume, Commissioner Byrne, that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base.	1.278548004024183
If you do not, we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you, exactly as we did with the seed directive. I should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise, both for your legal service and ours.	1.41060866489339
In other words, we do not need to re-negotiate the text; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive.	1.1216865553955877
I can hardly wait, Commissioner Byrne, to hear what you have to say to our proposals.	1.4369973758298624
Mr President, Commissioner, does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy?	1.131211587816357
As far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned, it comes under competition.	1.5796766863474057
Of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988.	1.1937166263926247
We want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle' s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support.	1.0139051190282342
However, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report, this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter.	1.5644755245856476
Food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions.	0.8660721178976498
When we talk of transparency in the food chain, that applies from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs.	1.2069155120991781
The antibiotics, growth promoters and genetically-modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain.	1.0902867579507622
The dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction.	1.0795205355691724
According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty, we are obliged to obviate sources of danger to human health, whereby the accent is clearly on sources.	1.0981027696371244
Consequently, we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger, i.e. harmful additives in feedingstuffs.	1.2718770815462475
Otherwise, in my view, we are beavering away at the symptoms, but not the causes.	1.5366223832155057
People are especially wary of GMOs.	0.5022845228379735
We must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly.	0.8752617309767118
First, if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms, then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment.	1.22211418326095
Secondly, it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation, as the rapporteur has said.	1.3692263200873045
And thirdly, if we are to have a transparent consumer policy, we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs.	1.2701687156989763
A clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice, both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer.	1.0680711707219321
Responsible citizens should, in my view, have a choice.	1.2353312848557838
We all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety.	0.9344931759959312
By regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently, we can help significantly to restore confidence.	1.3577942179348124
I too, therefore, can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments.	1.339245289789083
Consequently, we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be.	1.3166029149165495
Mr President, this proposal to amend the 1970 directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs.	1.3403841682244753
In other words, we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months.	1.1574423121215478
That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin, antibiotic, sludge and other scandals have attracted.	1.0040325587320316
In other words, this is an important facet of public health protection, which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base, not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission.	1.4901188500843168
The amendment which the Commission has proposed, namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987, is uncontested and has our full support.	1.2407822656956162
However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal.	1.290795644075231
The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives.	0.9377254029128306
Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded.	1.1385815175701106
This sort of monopoly, which could lead, for example, to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs, should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998.	1.2232521074229372
This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed.	0.8511642602632676
The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion, as recommended by the rapporteur, of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives, taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point.	1.4884527104732241
This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs.	0.9236344911617059
It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case, just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas, such as forest reproductive material, to mention just one example.	1.3331676763248475
The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect.	0.9991098282525867
On the one hand, it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and, on the other hand, it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs.	1.2594658383203123
Finally, our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur, who has gone to a great deal of trouble.	1.494424004083894
I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne' s reply.	1.2116122186343279
Mr President, the report deals mainly with formalities, in other words, the manner in which additives will be authorised. It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work.	1.3293313141562155
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview.	1.3584078425554427
We cannot carry on as we have done up until now, that is to say dealing with each detail on its own, often only after the harm has already been done.	1.3433195447935153
The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives.	0.7747859235572074
However, I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics.	1.2164039050376159
Certainly, five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned.	0.9918443637358452
It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four, both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves.	1.2319481007757218
We now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people's health, particularly in the case of small children.	1.0809171468786851
A number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary.	1.097968422074287
Several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same.	0.9703647582455868
We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but, in the case of antibiotics, it has long since been forgotten.	1.3754843141736475
However, there is another environmental principle at stake, namely the exchange principle.	1.5149911020730797
I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats.	0.9861315312486209
They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary.	1.185489945466077
There is a substitute, which is used to vaccinate chickens.	1.5338260280172322
Although it is a little more expensive, it does not harm the environment.	1.4168118431405115
Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields. In that way, they end up in our water supplies which, as we all know, are our most vital resource.	1.3710824022659573
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives.	1.1280508306942663
Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition.	1.1144611251139633
You may recall, even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public, that the Commission' s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil.	1.0228166133330545
We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals.	1.0782962303528991
Incidentally, it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs, cats and other domestic animals.	1.2557848175442858
Is it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry?	0.9914436436460073
Such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate, even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters.	1.2437141819439363
The precautions which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates.	1.195010350752955
As forcefully underlined by this report, labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock.	1.0760289175680375
He must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health.	0.8366939950341932
In any case, the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly traceable at all stages of their marketing.	1.0005739270811023
However, before labelling we need clear rules.	1.44768996175303
Straight questions must be asked about the real end-use of animal meal, for example.	0.9945824583599782
Although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms, it is their use which must be questioned today.	1.3057903222616607
In this respect, the chapter of the White Paper on food safety which deals with feedingstuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions.	0.9312492105293508
The Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined.	1.2001135693205427
This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and, to do this, the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time.	1.5572424015330304
This is why it is essential to approve Amendment No 2 to Recital 4 which avoids the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re-evaluation procedure.	1.1498147615993408
Also, Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such, thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions.	1.205634838489684
Mr President, because of the availability of high-technology additives in the feedingstuffs industry, detailed information on their use is needed from the actors, and as we know there are a lot of them, so that we can put a stop to practices which infringe Community law.	1.3534606253986956
This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own.	0.9293757609376289
Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them.	1.2397776792754687
Up the point at which meat, milk, bread and other products are sold over the shop counter, feedingstuffs and additives are structured, mixed, blended, cut and transported several times.	0.9423071088455147
The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems, just as it does in the foodstuffs industry.	1.148761916331647
The negative consequences are well known, the positive ones less so.	1.2074029335065026
I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region.	1.2427826762434906
However, more work is needed on this.	1.691798284540564
Mr President, may I commence by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on his report.	1.1955145230905655
It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality.	1.0478255764732183
The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health.	1.083414706416679
The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future, for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform.	1.411482060031572
But even in this crucial area of administration, Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility.	1.2509074279991004
In Agenda 2000, we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens: food safety, water quality, environmental protection and rural development.	1.3391326716961072
If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence, the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs.	1.2758364434410372
I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds.	1.047496023774027
Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely.	0.8035138931013313
I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety, Mr Byrne.	1.01782139848005
He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House, as well as to the concern of consumers.	1.1189861346986214
I am particularly pleased that my own country, Ireland, is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability.	1.2581826710289044
This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production.	1.2896984059263283
Mr President, Commissioner, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group.	1.4854549967371062
It is therefore specified that, through the adoption of a regulation, the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation. This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question.	1.476785936152243
A coherent legal framework must be re-established.	0.6805442603025791
As of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70/524/EEC for the replacement of the authorisations.	1.0261816459990345
However, we must ensure that competition distortions are not created, as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi.	1.252061860332633
Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this.	1.1315213244928293
The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision.	1.0538339866329345
This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget.	1.0729736957160394
There must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety.	0.838156348426472
I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	1.3367704453767912
Mr President, we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection.	1.4388642121363224
We therefore welcome the Commission' s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs.	0.991077162842912
The Committee on behalf of which I am speaking, namely the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, decided in December, on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture would draft such a good report, that we could waive our opinion.	1.4903709126745004
Nevertheless, I should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points.	1.2243666922508687
First, perhaps, I should say something on the question of the legal base.	1.4691656738024035
Even if we have new Rules of Procedure in Parliament, and it may well be that, with such an ambitious chairman in the Committee on Agriculture, problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment, one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict: cohesion in this Parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as I am concerned.	1.5095906321344323
Therefore, and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne, I reject your choice of legal basis.	1.4659644070446367
If it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives, then it is a mistake to keep it.	1.278046828378324
The Treaty of Amsterdam states quite clearly that, where people' s health is concerned, Article 152 is the correct legal base, and may I say to our own Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it is simply not good enough to look at the Commission' s proposal and say, there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection, so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection.	1.4103117467573763
My group, as Mr Kindermann has already said, will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise.	1.5534918274003773
Mr Byrne, I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation.	1.4787271998260965
If we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee, we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation.	1.3114392030532123
The Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article 37.	1.146174579676573
Allow me to comment briefly on two other points. First, genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs.	1.037130107572201
We cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law.	1.1960134795837736
We do not have another law at the moment, and until we do, we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled.	1.4171164774934344
The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign.	1.5522647122707913
I say now, as I have said on numerous occasions in the past: yes, I too would like the Commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this House, but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs.	1.484889426916573
It is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the Member States.	0.9968219188901024
There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet.	1.2116089502656724
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.	0.8892867878755383
This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future.	1.2690973429144168
What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers.	1.2813655729801
We must strike a balance between them.	0.6469422459892802
We must resolve this issue, because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat.	1.1740057945898945
One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned.	1.3816926669006417
GMOs are the new challenge facing us.	0.8455801472689962
This is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so: I myself share these concerns.	1.142620373827381
But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed.	1.1460616783583455
Indeed, we should not allow GMOs to obscure the fact that meat and bonemeal are still included in animal feeds in many countries in Europe.	1.1937814964422022
One factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food.	1.2987653009610571
These are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field: food must be of the same standard in all Member States.	1.2930899723761502
We have had the dioxin scare, BSE and many other problems.	1.287508738994161
The main problem is a financial one, namely who bears the cost?	1.2139050279435393
The problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer: the producer has been forced to bear all the cost.	1.1145700748219733
We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred.	1.0074780562776613
We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union.	1.2329166561189353
If we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future.	0.9377772753822297
. I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur, the committee chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for examining the Commission's proposal.	1.5518216994538265
The Commission proposal is, as some of you have said, rather technical.	1.5983517827346287
Nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective: to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives.	1.0290462860426788
At present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations, depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 January 1988.	0.9959541200299524
The purpose of the Commission's proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists.	1.388544262261344
The scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited.	1.1733471859570979
Five amendments have been presented by Parliament.	0.9798464772508131
I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments, despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament, the Agricultural Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on these issues.	1.3905719816421258
I shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately.	0.9536915967132337
The first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing Article 37 with Article 152.	1.117035216128436
I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection.	1.4828680454996572
The proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health.	0.9971862397471091
I note that Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also accepts that Article 37 is the appropriate legal base.	0.9530561614707368
I remind Parliament that in Article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health.	1.043694437862597
I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position, in my view, with precision, clarity and commendable brevity.	1.2090351816794875
Amendments Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives.	1.0763677588361746
I am the first to accept that GMOs are a very important issue.	1.3190070715960849
I also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiatives to update EU legislation in the field of GMOs are necessary.	1.0313620264238186
However, this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives.	1.5681348623842029
The Commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by Directive 70/524 on genetically modified additives at this stage.	1.2168695630965511
Instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90/220, which is currently in second reading in Parliament.	1.4315611943223763
The Commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments.	1.0740155951051955
I can also assure Parliament that I will ensure that the pertinent provisions of Directive 90/220 are included in the proposal for a recasting of Directive 70/524 that the Commission has proposed in the White Paper on food safety to present to Parliament before July 2001.	1.2355464728761123
I can also assure Parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account.	0.9324812587064444
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give undue preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted.	0.9618208935372498
The Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations.	0.8021756033557074
I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues.	1.4587831186624398
I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate.	1.004011540155605
First of all, regarding the observations made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additives in the Additives Directive 70/524, and not in the Novel Feed Directive.	1.2430542061249277
This is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives.	1.119452642998379
The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998.	1.1728717019735433
But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing.	1.0712172705921996
It is before Parliament for second reading.	0.8621544567304313
It is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90/220 and in particular, Article 11.	1.3934852142726293
Reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies.	1.1505153536160149
Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this.	0.6386330102105424
There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue.	1.461478388704176
First of all, this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993, so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers.	1.3972697159249616
Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product.	0.8681595386486325
I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives.	1.3040929855442744
Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base, whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152.	1.194346998477719
I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health.	1.3170964365950064
This is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the European Court of Justice, which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation.	1.3196741086367987
The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this.	1.3098540079622591
As an overall comment to the suggested amendments here, particularly in relation to the legal base issue, it would be inappropriate, in my opinion, to change the legal base to Article 152 in these circumstances, as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the Court.	1.4573090084348517
A number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling.	1.4408056756410021
Directive 70/524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives.	0.8833558270821747
It is already included now: "indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products".	1.192660330137617
So this issue will be addressed.	0.9252639360860193
That formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product, the subject matter of the application.	1.247599087213287
Mr President, allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question.	1.2304203482732758
First allow me to point out, Commissioner Byrne, that the European Parliament has no right of legislative initiative.	1.5516630734262857
But we do reserve the right, when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation, to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out.	1.3000619299227856
Nonetheless, we have confined ourselves in our proposed amendments to bringing the text into line with that of other directives and we have disregarded the question of content.	1.3587689539812804
For example, you did not go into antibiotics.	1.4466547721174108
We are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives.	1.1428122020894678
My question, Commissioner Byrne is this: the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade.	1.2328037973326929
Do you really believe that, if we could, Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union?	1.4145599438526186
Commissioner Byrne, it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament.	1.0956642724799084
We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years.	0.7125867292242911
I look forward to the next round.	1.1053415933876918
. I would stress that no GMOs have been approved under this directive; it applies only to additives.	1.3506123108680805
I would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue.	1.5320060332957253
It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way, particularly in Directive 90/220.	1.3573496097224105
This issue is before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it, which will also come under the legal base of Article 152 which gives Parliament full competence in the areas of codecision.	1.381408411110247
I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue.	1.0970877858366002
It is my intention, as it has always been, to work in cooperation with Parliament, to ensure that the results we achieve are the very best results.	1.5742883224540862
The best way of dealing with this issue is through the draft legislation before Parliament at the moment, as well as the legislation in the pipeline, rather than in this technical document and in circumstances where the questions that are set out and to be debated in Directive 90/220 may not be fully taken into account.	1.22581688528634
It is best to wait for that debate which, I understand, will take place fairly soon.	1.5439894674166703
All of these matters will be addressed in that legislation.	1.086680978915097
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
Parliament has taken due note of your comments.	0.9412262066242231
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	0.28917441844220476
Scrapie	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0023/2000) by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/68/EC as regards scrapie (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0026/1999 - 1998/0324(COD)).	0.7078817387949894
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was and always will be one of life' s mysteries, one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis, that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep.	1.1545808770246406
In this respect, the Commission' s proposals to amend directive 91/68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the detection and control of TSE infections in general, comply with Parliament' s demands in the wake of the follow-up report by the BSE committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this.	1.1874887275324102
I should, however, like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them BSE-infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is indistinguishable from the symptoms of scrapie.	1.0044895537746512
No new knowledge was needed, because the theory from the beginning was that BSE and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold.	1.0987577901750705
From this point of view we are slightly behind the times.	0.8557056138768475
I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission' s proposal on scrapie.	1.2485480469349686
I should, however, like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new TSE regulation allows a reasonable symbiosis between consumer protection and practicable suggestions.	1.2025692184550696
We therefore need to take consistent account of six or seven points in the coming debate on the TSE proposal, and that of course includes scrapie.	1.3830900751497621
When we discuss the TSE regulation, Commissioner, we must also clarify that we shortly intend to discuss separate proposals under Article 152 as the corresponding legal base for products excluded from this regulation, such as cosmetics, medicinal products or animal feed.	1.1347878233883262
We insist on this.	0.48639671961039055
As far as I am concerned, that means that fundamental core provisions in this proposed regulation must not be relegated yet again to the Annex but included in the body of the proposed regulation because we here in Parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here.	1.1790956564223625
It also means that, when we are fighting these diseases, the problem of destroying whole herds in the event of an outbreak of scrapie or BSE and the question of defining geographical areas are items which also remain on the agenda.	1.1981418485333073
Although I welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie is included in the TSE regulation, I feel that the Commission' s proposals for fighting scrapie are still not consistent enough and I shall submit amendments on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to tighten up the proposals when the Roth-Behrendt report is debated.	1.3404386433812252
I should also like to address two other points. We expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of Member States as regards outbreaks of scrapie or TSEs.	1.2305259481299187
Here again the Commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by Parliament.	1.365745766860341
Finally, in discussing the question of the future application of tests, we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reached the point where tests are generally applicable.	1.5462618017176704
But the tests available now are perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy, albeit not for every individual animal.	1.1502636782867235
But when we need to consider if a region can move from a negative epidemiological status to a better category, an epidemiological inspection of the situation in a region in the form of suitable sampling in abattoirs using such tests can provide useful pointers in the political and scientific debate as to where there is a need for preventive consumer protection and, basically, where such tests can be used to help us settle disputes on a proper basis.	1.3156554859533487
I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you would take these passing comments on board in the report on scrapie and in the general report on the fight against TSEs and bear in mind that we shall be calling you to account on these points.	1.411002028625855
Mr President, over the years, the following situation has arisen: one subject has developed into a subject of many facets.	1.3021972211094262
Many of us here in this House have spent years, whether we intended to or not, dealing solely with the consequences of the BSE scandal right down to the last detail.	1.3907880536994353
And it is still on the agenda today.	1.3259538957074184
It is therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr Böge are talking about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report.	1.3778212404687835
The cast is always the same.	0.7425550302882862
Although the cause was unfortunate, it was certainly not the worst experience of this Parliament.	1.3075609607493706
My task as draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee is a very simple one.	1.3319274593361907
I agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the Environment Committee has asked the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to agree to the Commission proposal.	1.3990197607960086
That saves a great deal of time which I would like to use for other things and which I shall use now somewhat in anticipation, as Mr Böge has just done.	1.4758477738167568
I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House.	0.8682726846624459
At first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now.	0.8282242114464706
But I have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing.	1.2277723210502363
This debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity, Mr Byrne, to give the Commission a few things to think about.	1.4392928794839353
Although we did not have a very positive exchange on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf' s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree, things may be different with this report.	1.4144022890030745
Allow me to say from the outset that the part of the complex report which Mr Böge dealt with - and this form of collaboration between two committees, with one leading committee and the other giving an opinion and vice versa, worked very well and could perhaps be used as a model for the future - is relatively simple.	1.4005558575994106
It will become more difficult once we see the TSE proposal, Mr Byrne.	1.1479640248756477
When we have the chance to ask direct questions, the questions which Mr Böge referred to will be asked.	1.2280909963316218
Questions will be asked - questions which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries.	1.5742821494774972
How will BSE status in fact be defined then?	0.9099928110350829
Do you envisage circumstances under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test?	1.012055184436788
And then there is my standing question to you Mr Byrne, a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you. What about the BSE test?	1.3106930592683683
When will you make it compulsory?	0.8799539738353184
Perhaps you will do so before Parliament debates the TSE report.	1.0205654048656179
Not that I want to put it off, but it would be a gesture, as it were, if you could say: here is the proposed legislation on the BSE test.	1.525385456170271
I know that I am a thorn in your side on this, but sometimes that is my job.	1.521276003106037
I say quite emphatically, even after the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who is completely involved in the whole idea, that animal feeding, animal rearing, animal production must be suited to the species and must also, above all, cause no harm or danger to human beings.	1.23891135354274
Cosmetic, medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous.	1.1058782825705797
That is, without doubt, too short, too sweet and too little.	1.404010886634622
You are lucky that Mr Böge' s report only deals with this on the sidelines; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble doing so.	1.1441309064896215
Finally, just one more brief comment, Mr Byrne.	1.613793663653392
We have a new Commission.	1.234069974026361
Whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this Commission and the President of the Commission, only time will tell.	1.293294463356583
But there is one thing we certainly will not let you get away with and I am sure that, as a lawyer and politician you will understand this. Important issues cannot be regulated in annexes.	1.4221614826250286
They belong in the legislative text. I might do the same if I were a Commissioner, because I could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and I would not always need to work with Parliament, which takes so long and is so difficult.	1.5834497041410838
But you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this.	1.017574144012923
In other words, whenever I get the chance, I shall take everything out of the annexes and cram it into the legislative text.	1.1810902507532453
And you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset.	0.9651293671956565
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it is for this chain to provide us with safe, healthy food which is produced, as a matter of principle, without any questionable or risky interim or end products.	1.1299960195724992
Over recent years, these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed.	1.0127343929025796
The European Parliament has already taken a clear stand on BSE and I think that we should do likewise on all epidemics in animals.	1.349613799289117
We should not allow food safety to be compromised because, in the final analysis, it is our health which is at stake.	1.3226505678491802
The Commission' s proposal encompasses both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goats and a Community regulation to fight scrapie.	1.1064234620480704
This is even more important given that there is no clear proof that BSE and scrapie are unrelated.	1.1390482745421935
Animals are bought throughout Europe and transported over the entire continent.	0.8701675825149708
The spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers.	0.892166082683737
And I should point out that, for the first time in history, a case of scrapie was detected in Austria about four weeks ago.	1.2655511029675812
Scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the pathogen can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food.	0.8975944488867053
The disease is always fatal.	0.6046567825611722
As there is no vaccination, farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie.	1.1233478878105827
Even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings, the connection with BSE has still not been clarified, as I have already said.	1.3002554497035204
As a farmer myself, I am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk.	1.3678749252356799
I am in favour of preventive measures, starting with feeding which is suitable for the species, rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out.	1.024204766230104
I therefore welcome the Commission' s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie.	1.2253136890781515
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Böge' s report on measures to prevent TSE diseases is based on the proposals of the European Parliament' s temporary BSE Committee.	1.1649152338573456
Mr Böge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee, and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the BSE Committee in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has fallen to him: he is the one with the experience.	1.260544088874383
I would have liked my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treated the second part of the Commission' s proposal.	1.2685043720763025
I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is featured in the plenary session.	1.071618101716185
In the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease.	0.8895120489890941
It is indeed.	0.7349331511833973
For me as a Finn, and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals, it is most important that those EU states where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals.	1.3416207263282238
I wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease.	1.0896346320713794
The possibility, if necessary, of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement, as there really is justification for it.	1.2064622934307543
The inspections must be seen as being fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the EU.	0.9875949757671431
On behalf of the European Liberal Democrats, we can support the Commission' s proposal on Mr Böge' s report, but in the forthcoming debate on Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where TSEs do not occur.	1.4948855277646698
Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur.	1.2906534360135768
There is no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field.	1.2766204444137264
It is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important.	1.4521880246870726
Regardless of the many other concerns we may have, BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved.	1.192122063358988
It is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem.	1.0452528194038515
I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will, I hope, address this situation.	1.3379626689146338
We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future.	1.1486026106903013
No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again.	1.195749335522218
We have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work.	1.7517101802191795
It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it.	1.3009780006810059
BSE has certainly not gone away.	0.6669134075807593
You can see it in different countries.	1.0533545399339652
I do not want to point the finger at any particular country, but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom.	1.3268896890717572
It will be there for some time to come.	1.2204903774884284
We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability, of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain, is part of that confidence-building mechanism.	1.3649796178557965
If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future.	1.2153317678917204
Finally, I have certainly believed for a long time, coming from an agricultural background myself, that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had BSE in the first place.	1.295882726627571
It was never the responsibility of the farmer, it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again.	1.353025322635126
. Mr President, I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, namely combating TSEs.	1.4615912758943983
I should also like to thank Mr Böge for his work on this issue.	1.0814252213544424
Considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation under Article 152 of the Treaty on the prevention and control of TSEs.	1.2344896303464241
This proposal addresses all TSE risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain.	0.9218630919198025
I am here today to listen to your opinions on the first step in this process of establishing a truly comprehensive Community system for the control of these diseases.	1.2116186456096514
I have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing Community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation.	1.1758407964352464
The detailed rules would then follow in that framework proposal.	0.7926325113618259
I have been informed that you welcome this initiative, as appears from your contributions this afternoon, to formulate a single text.	1.26912887935692
I am looking forward to discussing any further improvements you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation, especially after the reference made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue.	1.143542559856177
I look forward to receipt of that document, which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue.	1.1522806336845215
Finally, I would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between Parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions, speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation.	1.2887776014675976
In the months I have been Commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system, I can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve, that is, the translation of policy into legislation.	1.4182970851668497
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	0.28917441844220476
Community policy in the field of water	0.49241097993906097
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0027/2000) on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	1.1265128209196835
- (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty-first century.	1.0019114232034858
Climate change, global resources, river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future.	0.8544415725775506
We will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet' s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions, the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even, more fundamentally, the global balance.	1.2150336580316434
To support this statement, I would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague, Mário Soares, in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans.	1.4980114583801276
When talking about climate change, we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere.	1.2808120556112326
Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet.	0.9818703253084843
Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent, both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, including its groundwater, surface waters and seas.	1.164100034407975
Furthermore, Europe has signed international conventions, in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it made certain commitments.	1.5294712796199448
In this it said that in a few years' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances.	1.2556351866919209
Despite having signed these international agreements, this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened.	1.301219833556881
This is why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy, the European Parliament has since the first reading demanded coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives, particularly with regard to respect for OSPAR. This convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action.	1.4425366794077217
The European Union' s water policy is not starting from zero.	1.258312676073459
Many directives have already been adopted. Furthermore, the Commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives.	1.3392783698361566
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation.	1.0523121730215996
However, at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made, like OSPAR, but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs.	1.5703338615692362
For despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection, when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved.	1.3930598294252095
In many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts.	1.1696726229348489
We must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us.	0.9720412790732603
Yet we do not have much time.	0.7600723860906
We could, as the Commission has proposed, accept these overlong deadlines which the Commission and the Council have extended even further. Yet if we do, we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public, but these efforts will be postponed until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be deferred again.	1.4693080280838908
It is clear that in this event the objectives will never be achieved.	1.1029577431160478
I am stressing this point because, when disasters are being reported daily in the news, we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that Europe did not act when it should have done. Then, in our haste, we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time.	1.3939493125419355
The current example of the Danube and the pollution from Rumania shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development, clear requirements, controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers, this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time.	1.1853147953327159
It is also clear that if we do nothing, our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner.	1.3910250232703765
Even now, the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism.	1.205790951527431
To conclude, the issues are clear at this second reading.	1.2933631258617286
Do we or do we not want standards compatible with OSPAR, in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero?	1.1995364953598002
Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive?	1.2289042185233057
Do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water?	0.978720299567344
Do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples?	0.848791754122139
The majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives. I hope they will be supported by this House.	1.1221610760104357
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us, especially as the very source of life for human beings.	1.2774272353800136
The problem is one of both water quality and water resources, of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe, especially in very dry regions.	1.3723930082803988
I am sorry that Commissioner Wallström, who is responsible in this area, cannot be here now because this is, after all, a very, very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time, and water protection legislation, which we are debating now at second reading, affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join, who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede.	1.4269708723291463
We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994.	1.0843594813774173
A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers.	1.1434616000772286
We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77, but another 30 have been added.	1.218589442357902
You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different.	1.3027683363303209
Some want tighter legislation, some want more clarification, others want to serve national interests.	1.0877398601559998
Even within my group, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there were, of course, differences of opinion.	0.9953633681522498
Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions.	1.027481410201718
In this sense, the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position.	1.291930881405902
Some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the European Parliament' s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the Council of Ministers.	1.1951239888816487
We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament' s credibility.	0.8428134144249853
For me, that includes the zero demand, i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020.	1.0856484576738692
That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings.	0.7289773741597673
I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and European water protection laws, however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the Member States.	1.362906708937232
I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted.	1.3107269368865753
That does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money.	1.2404571003539648
Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days.	0.9918016564036413
You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water.	1.071656389883519
The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too.	1.189168556292356
I am horrified that both Members of Parliament and the public have been misled by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter.	1.1290882570233234
I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises.	0.8883540888395821
I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, for all her work and her cooperative attitude, even if we have agreed to differ on certain points.	1.2642989485233296
And I also thank the representatives of the European Commission, who stood by with advice and expert help at all times.	1.1871202285054123
If the representatives of the Council of Ministers take an equally constructive approach, then I have no doubt that together we shall find an even better solution to the problem of water protection in Europe under the conciliation procedure.	1.354885904302911
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work which she has presented and on her efforts in terms of overcoming the differences between us with regard to water.	1.086956052089524
The framework directive on water is a necessary initiative.	1.0757974005592084
Nevertheless, given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction, this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion.	1.3619997175933318
Nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us.	0.9997684611070934
However, in Spain and the other southern countries, which have an unusual climate, the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures.	1.4885783825033918
Therefore, we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and, to this end, I ask that you support Amendment No 95, which has been presented by our group.	1.4826525707385478
We wish to ensure that Article 1 of the directive promotes the sustainable, efficient, fair and considerate use of water.	1.1851294192786566
I am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the Spanish Socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here.	1.0664025315066021
One example is water transfers.	0.6829204861535046
We would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to Community supervision.	1.0616683727760305
We consider that, given the hydrological characteristics of Spain, where transfers of a structural nature are carried out, the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources, and these decisions should, of course, always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water.	1.4312819467549671
With regard to one of the most controversial points of our debate, the application of tariffs, the Spanish Socialists have been arguing, in accordance with the principle that the polluter should pay, that the directive should propose policies on accessible prices for all levels of consumption.	1.4014932885992935
In Spain, a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe.	1.2616997308412174
The Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses, owing to the scarcity of water resources and the internalisation of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive.	1.1493340152855442
We have therefore always argued for a progressive system of recuperation of costs. This system should take good account of social, environmental and economic effects, and its implementation should be modulated in accordance with differing geographical and climatic conditions.	1.2527870308124633
We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment.	1.1133082491423902
However, an environmental Europe cannot, in any circumstances, be built at different speeds, but must be built from a point of view of solidarity.	1.6551684896120904
Mr President, the ecological disaster in the Danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of Europe are and how important water is to us all.	1.4116689657244688
Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe.	0.9993565714723688
This brings home the connections which bind us together.	0.6628735290837826
This framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details.	1.1313276578041664
It is important for us to remember that this is a framework.	1.375611788507586
These brushstrokes are indeed very broad.	0.632493991999506
It is easy for individual countries, for individual sectors of industry, to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days.	1.3437572689819273
There are many opportunities to hide.	0.9663746427977324
The reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in daughter directives in months and years to come.	1.0854381138729365
That is the time to debate some of these problems of detail.	1.389966749423513
The broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept - the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater, the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals, which we all need in society in all circumstances, should not be finding their way into our water system.	1.3621032955704235
There is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation.	1.4753413478853037
I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing.	1.342848766653693
This is something that they prefer to avoid doing.	1.0374400765816545
The principle also concerns water charging.	0.5995699845671011
The basic understanding which many of us now share is that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation, to use the carrot-and-stick approach to make best use of our assets so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water.	1.1752377239466816
I want to refer to the political position here.	1.0227782590732257
The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading.	0.9878714900359057
Some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless.	1.1934192498114249
It is a retrograde step.	1.254362897818896
This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation.	1.2692250387164585
We need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation.	1.265994239927596
We have seen vote after vote lost.	0.9627115782554521
Measure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee.	1.0873115513291514
We have failed to achieve a qualified majority.	0.8062101760790391
Our attempt to improve the environment of Europe has failed.	0.9413053240594038
We need to get into that conciliation position.	1.1267809276413332
We need, at the end of the day, to ensure that we end up with a sensible, balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost.	1.103852551888689
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as long as nearly thirty years ago, the European Commission made attempts to draw up a European water policy.	1.2489375633632533
A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated.	0.7710297932400318
Eventually, standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances.	0.9231067704903192
The unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle.	0.861258728935583
Some seven years ago, it still looked like the European water policy was going to be sacrificed on the altar of subsidiarity.	1.153000735408038
The conservative government leaders Messrs Major and Kohl decided in a cosy fireside chat at the Edinburgh Summit that it was totally unnecessary for the Spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the Germans or English.	0.9967495225236758
This sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency.	0.964063735367033
That position is like holey cheese, or to keep it the sphere of water, as leaky as a sieve.	1.2621696277365937
It explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment: nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading.	1.172259587132867
This is unusual, but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes.	1.180405004041414
The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak.	0.6799861783183241
The chemical industry and, unfortunately, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance.	1.1595595467093027
This is very time-consuming, and, more importantly, there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances.	1.256425231103795
Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable.	0.9306077839232131
This is what is meant by the term "close-to-zero" .	1.0241642672538867
The Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances, many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect.	1.1477996951198353
These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause, even in extremely minimal quantities, changes in the gender of animals and even humans, as is more and more being ascertained by scientists.	1.219901425721312
This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020.	1.3100597796364746
I would like to mention two substances from the Commission' s list: mercury and tributyl, abbreviated to TBT.	1.174332406618357
On the bottom of the Wadden Sea, the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value, to wit, ten and one thousand times, respectively.	1.1115341293782501
The chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes, and if this is impossible, to apply them in closed systems.	1.33739724429833
For the substance TBT, this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance.	1.3527160075627835
A sound alternative would be to clean the ship' s sides mechanically.	1.039734100112171
I would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substances by the year 2020.	1.1896477653698248
Mr President, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive.	1.3448994207617584
The Council's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas.	1.0744595620409887
Therefore, our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete.	1.4774298066722809
As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals.	0.9983322576071162
Firstly, we think that the time-frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the Council.	1.3905935586415297
We therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive.	1.1240754015210543
Secondly, I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently.	1.1906557556810458
There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented.	1.077468279635482
The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions, such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected.	1.248397060406877
Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy.	1.3248981759553946
This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used.	1.4088106196202195
Nowadays, taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming.	0.9012897571355708
The obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay, although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases.	1.0842882958633815
Fourthly, we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined.	1.3878392510036048
Fifthly, the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear.	1.1356452122218057
Against that background, our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by Mrs Lienemann, the rapporteur, as adopted in committee.	1.3261511138170397
We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended.	1.2993981003536954
We will therefore vote for the Greens' Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position.	1.3408860921223256
As regards pricing policy, there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report.	1.1495373870042
My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43, tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens' Amendment No 105.	1.20636675491001
I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned.	0.9957447277953162
However, some people in our political group think otherwise.	1.675841201632575
Consequently, Amendment No 107, on the same question, has been tabled by one section of our group only.	1.650311372729658
On the whole, I welcome the committee's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise.	1.258602679114458
Mr President, every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet, yet the abundance of water is an illusion.	1.3391909590846223
The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders.	1.0473102117923758
Water is a renewable but limited natural resource.	0.5519699355199346
It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable.	0.9474477341937174
In the EU, this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas.	1.4726522057015499
The increase in vulnerable areas, both wet and dry, inequalities between countries, inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic, economic, geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need. However, these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community.	1.232782655360112
We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land.	1.3800964367214799
Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive.	1.324777108566123
It is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought. Last October in Turin, the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean.	1.38425535585278
We are not, fortunately, at this point.	1.3815595092858686
However, we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods, which the directive underlines.	1.5049941636509567
For example, France, the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding.	1.1666005582613292
We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other.	1.227342992948485
Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water.	1.1100412936666875
The water issue will definitely not be settled today.	0.833678565793266
In fact, the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects.	1.2033450827615255
Mr President, it is very likely that, during this century, good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil.	1.5361674626601034
This is enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water.	1.1001924388003055
It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework.	0.7617444197994939
With the framework directive on water policy, we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the EU' s water legislation.	1.242925330273635
But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies.	1.1243097148395647
More specifically, the possibilities for adopting a specific policy by Member States and water boards, which have been set up thanks to the catchment basin approach, need to be maximised.	1.1907458854597397
The key goals remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water, the protection of eco systems, the promotion of the sustainable use of water, the control of floods and droughts and the termination of discharging dangerous substances into surface water.	1.1399012527345294
As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned, I am of the opinion that the Councils' objectives lack both commitment and ambition.	1.204541493696118
The Committee on the Environment' s present proposal to reduce discharges to close-to-zero is, in my view, to be welcomed and worthy of emulation.	1.4327581315418807
However, a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability.	1.4569665167720134
Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced, as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control, and which pollute the water quite substantially.	1.2264412092950137
Mr President, we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect.	1.4143207415292534
In the 20th century, water was merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substances, special waste, chemicals and so on. And we can already see the consequences!	1.2078180243850423
We need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation.	1.0379435838646536
The directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the Commission is planning here.	1.2562505606463468
In the final analysis, water protection is not just a social question, it is a decisive social question, which is why the polluter pays principle must be applied more rigorously as otherwise we all bear the consequences.	1.3574340073859652
Given the advanced state of pollution of water resources, it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements.	1.2485979491651313
Mr President, it must be some six years ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, assisted by Mrs Ursula Schleicher, put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety.	1.2061441651626568
It is not an easy topic and, in my opinion, the efforts made by Mrs Lienemann are very laudable indeed.	1.4280476379949065
The decision-making process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage.	1.1292598968835654
The topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result, we have been able to draft important, more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading.	1.2389592555332833
In fact, the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal.	1.2374838716165302
It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge.	1.421308950716513
I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect: in the North of Europe, we often face floods, but also polluted water, from industry, whilst the problem facing the Members in the South is often related to transporting water over long distances, simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture.	1.4929019951824776
I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail.	1.062702783656536
I would first of all like to focus on quality.	0.8646981600390162
The Netherlands is significantly affected by the European water policy.	1.0214670263552068
A very important component, to wit, one third of our drinking water, is extracted from surface water in the Netherlands.	1.3963355071896824
The Netherlands is located downstream, in a delta, which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance.	1.3221028657925837
Another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality.	1.0318635243555845
In a number of amendments, the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question.	1.0799635857273566
Although I understand that, according to some, this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially, I do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure.	1.56054074569872
I would now like to say a few words on quantity management.	0.8013487620088526
In his poem "Herinneringen aan Holland" [ "Reminiscing about Holland" ], a famous Dutch poet mentioned water too, which, with its never-ending trail of destruction, was feared and respected.	1.3570924311823676
In 1953, we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology.	1.149463370460089
When our rivers flooded in 1990, we established that installing artificial works upstream affects the water-storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage.	1.059457731890089
This means that in terms of quantity management too, we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it.	1.1918390686038034
Mr President, I too would like to start by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work.	0.8891878828115188
Water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right.	1.2352777345994372
Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident, as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too.	1.376275630739144
Water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples.	0.9171609481921009
This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination.	1.1795978323004501
We need to recognise that water is a joint liability.	1.1537325583076865
Cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident.	0.6555479478015335
Too little operational capacity upstream or, in fact, excessive use, can cause problems downstream.	1.2079076664058348
Coordination is the key word here.	0.9271724444398325
The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical.	1.1435606901855198
Changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation.	0.8181609313975227
Some areas are becoming drier, whilst many are becoming wetter.	1.0239828145463432
It is time for action.	0.995521343522637
In March, the Second World Water Forum will be held in The Hague.	1.327209968031481
This Forum stands for a worldwide vision.	0.6660959488975893
This vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control.	0.9004105498342605
The time for action is upon us.	0.9707383685756478
The European Parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time.	1.1627498758675616
But we should not lower our standards too much either.	1.0047835712675734
The common position is not ambitious enough.	1.0696002637283268
This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements, or the OSPAR objectives.	1.2313831676951268
We need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020.	1.0347476590977562
This has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too.	1.209958255093612
The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up.	0.8850932130424225
A list has been compiled, containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment.	0.9447183313355902
It is both technically and economically possible to reduce the emission of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again.	1.0228663896751848
Needless to say, the directive also needs to be binding.	1.0057009155460115
Countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives.	0.9629958910918606
Quality has a price, but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future.	1.1985098979017728
Mr President, Commissioner, my compliments to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive.	1.087998108556692
I should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change, the depletion of primeval forests and overfishing, constantly affect our common and vital but, in some ways, unowned resources.	1.2550582576410068
We should also recognise that, in Europe, our fresh water sources may be said to be on the borderline between being owned by everyone and by no-one.	1.247612121521256
It is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established.	1.1558824708397781
It is also important for the different watercourses to be kept together and managed as the totality they in fact are, irrespective of who owns one section or another of a common watercourse.	1.2339988649579874
Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive does indeed, as many speakers have already said, represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the jumble of piecemeal EU regulations and directives and achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe.	1.2008113735436163
However, I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation.	1.4032617041401643
I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental points.	1.3837972540678174
First OSPAR.	-0.0
We know that the Commission proposal does not go far enough; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment.	1.2826625100197915
Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough.	0.8581123496459125
What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR.	1.1133733827339423
Only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and, more importantly, objectives which are enforceable under the law.	1.0314267692279995
Anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters, such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary, from happening to us.	1.2334038701872903
I find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection, despite having agreed internationally on OSPAR.	1.1014684939804373
But I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament, in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised.	1.4298228559433077
It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth.	1.0528410358928173
We must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry lobbyists; on the contrary, we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and, hence, cost-covering prices.	1.3726806552113786
Water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the OSPAR convention.	1.0736867891429938
With closed production circuits this is possible; anything else would water down the directive.	0.858560662821646
Let us grab our chance.	0.45061075119966904
Mr President, in the small amount of time allotted to me, I would like to welcome the Mrs Lienemann' s report and remind the House of three principles, to which all other principles must be subordinate, which are clearly expressed in the rapporteur' s amendments: water is not a commercial product, but the property of all the peoples of the Union; the ultimate objective is to eliminate all pollutants in surface water and groundwater, and to inform the public so that it can participate in the recuperation of water and not use water excessively given that it is such a precious commodity.	1.5070772990559682
I know that this directive may have problems, given the differing situations of the various countries of the Union, as has already been mentioned.	1.4839336006985684
The situation in the north is different from that in the south, and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas.	1.4844430639011372
I understand this.	0.5189914104419899
However, there are some amendments which attempt to help the countries of the south, specifically Amendment No 43 which, with regard to the recuperation of costs, also indicates that Member States must take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when it comes to decision making.	1.497973082198413
There are also difficulties with the issue of transfers.	1.0103543910543156
In my country - I live in the north of Spain -, there is a considerable difference between the north and the south, and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another.	1.485373735474642
However, Mrs Lienemann' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water.	1.345268047666759
I know that this is a difficult report and that the differing situations of countries cause difficulties, but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what is happening on the Danube and what happened in Doñana.	1.4543361224896445
We cannot allow our European water to be polluted, Mr President, and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water, which is so precious to all of us.	1.3883463614378124
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report.	1.351228745034458
As an Irish Member of the European Parliament, coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water, I support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive.	1.3331803482491307
However, I would now like to look at the areas of difference between Parliament's Committee on the Environment and the Council.	1.4241175534618413
The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter.	0.8736402855598112
According to the Council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force, whereas Parliament's Committee on the Environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years.	1.2357404905100353
I see no reason why European Union Member States cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible.	1.1498515223785764
I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage.	1.0949959343273838
The Council in its common position states that the European Union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage.	1.198159274844853
No specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position.	0.9676740019537222
Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in Europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently.	1.1281903862687137
Moreover, an adequate contribution from different economic sectors, broken down into industrial, household and agricultural sectors, must ensure that this policy is implemented.	1.3577641558516726
Unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that metering and water rates should be implemented for households right across the European Union states.	1.215960408589723
This is politically impractical from an Irish perspective, as indeed it would be from the perspective of other EU Member States such as Portugal, Greece and Spain.	1.1080944251342837
Mr President, I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report.	1.5579303477144277
It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come.	1.322882477336683
We can do this by, as a Parliament, amending the Council' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment.	1.3673638575249825
In its unaltered form, the present directive could, in fact, have very unfortunate and long-term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water.	1.3799178198579123
It would be to send out the wrong signals both to European industry and to the European people.	1.4820919157486228
It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters.	0.9144182217417187
The directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100,000 chemicals in circulation.	1.0810983889968802
We cannot afford to wait.	0.5028597892019807
In this connection, I would ask Parliament to support Amendment No 108, in which the words "water pollution caused by individual pollutants" are replaced by "prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges" .	1.146863647179745
We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment.	0.8288494508776298
The EU' s Ministers for the Environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the OSPAR Convention, which now already defines what is hazardous to the environment.	1.304169043146588
This Convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and, not least, to our descendants.	1.3279537095968703
Mr President, it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive.	1.2368405056066418
The Treaty of Amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention, for the implementation of the 'polluter pays' principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment.	1.2283436243831707
Clearly, the importance of recognising the economic value of ecological factors in setting prices and making operators accountable through the adoption of incentives for non-polluting systems, seems unquestionable in the light of events that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage, particularly our water resources.	1.183396230974266
This situation is loudly echoed in many sectors of the economy, and especially in the agricultural sector.	1.2261138787998607
The concept of good agricultural practice has been introduced in amongst the complexity of the current relationships between agriculture, environment and water resources, and between positive and negative effects, and amongst the wide range of local realities and production systems and so on. This concept indicates which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the Community expectation of an environmental protection of water resources that surpasses basic standards, along with the subsequent costs and reductions in income.	1.2098596011592708
The obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration derives from this notion, with the aim of keeping the management of water resources at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of current conditions.	1.20152114200521
We must not, with this in mind, pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting, improving and restoring their quality, as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques.	1.2567328318422268
As regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment, an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community levels, which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities.	1.2409455309297421
Finally, we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances, using the increased information available on their chemical, physical and biological properties, in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage, which is fundamental to us all.	1.2990244489125404
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam seriously, then our long-term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption.	1.327489592463726
We can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards.	1.066156681451706
In this respect, I fully support the amendments proposed by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that, when people use water, they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks.	1.3545940980588151
This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting.	0.8982861144559059
First there is wide information for and involvement by the public, a rarity in a European directive.	1.2587984238110206
Secondly, there is compulsory cooperation.	1.5874400494840315
I am glad a holistic approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality.	1.369750881529168
Thirdly, I should like to address the question of the timetable.	1.3019654642621934
I am firmly convinced that we need a strict, tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective.	1.2326213859461939
Compare it with what happens in December.	0.891008299957522
We all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents.	0.9731430763173348
But what would we do if we knew in December that Christmas was in thirty years' time.	0.9134031466628136
We all know what we would do, which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy.	1.4256368332118607
I emphatically support the rapporteur' s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive, from the list of measures to the question of employment measures.	1.3084081145575475
Mr President, the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the Member States work together to protect groundwater, drinking water and surface water and that the level of protection corresponds to existing EU environmental legislation.	1.3069332240473004
May I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the Nitrates Directive have still not been implemented in all Member States, in spite of the fact that there is a common EU resolution.	1.1840697599526275
The present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives.	1.0130752037314525
It is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced synthetic substances.	1.0042874834996989
This cannot be done, and it also, in any case, goes against nature.	1.4016462975879045
Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment.	1.1143373684575446
European agriculture would not, for example, be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread.	1.3726762628269051
As a result, agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU, with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs.	1.2517738160946463
I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs.	1.037777818915659
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is a precious raw material.	1.0186703142360807
Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal.	1.2960117629717784
It should, therefore, not surprise us that water is the cause of wars.	1.2034198129641867
The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs.	0.8811527150768157
General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation.	0.8373311819228326
Europe is therefore facing an arduous task; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation.	1.0900429689849171
I have to admit that in Flanders, where I come from, we still have a long way to go too.	1.260683349039556
We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter.	1.0754852000525814
Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way.	1.2456349924066603
The common position is in this respect a farce, a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements.	1.3755446915231135
The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years.	0.8967323823737198
By then, my children will be older than I am now.	1.2871890492044702
You have to admit: this is a joke.	1.3669712219498196
Tomorrow, we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children.	1.3528988323327484
Either we opt for the amendments of my group, of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment.	1.2818005803083925
I would like to finish off with this observation.	1.0444599713003089
In the past couple of months, we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium.	1.4101473435362313
What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers.	0.9161540842679694
In our own country, this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations.	1.0944559601020942
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament' s more drastic positioning.	1.1836849201570063
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware.	1.3453098888581358
Ladies and gentlemen, fine words are no longer sufficient.	1.0804363865471982
We need to change tack completely.	0.9718484175134632
During the vote tomorrow, we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy.	1.3705145225383741
This can only benefit our credibility.	0.8280963691349357
The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.	0.9522686322876178
The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform	0.487883834572512
The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform: the issues at stake.	1.3521743141717157
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today. I am basically here to speak to you, as indicated by your agenda, on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform.	1.5562880154990204
This reform must involve all the actors in European construction, with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner, the Council ministers and national MPs. It must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European construction.	1.3663062507229702
This morning, in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi, many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions.	1.4949664399201996
Yet it is not just a question of who does what, as one of you said very clearly and forcefully.	1.370162663893617
Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do.	1.2143283951975978
We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future, particularly with the countries which will be joining us.	1.6342703288500968
We too are concerned about this lack of democracy, and the Commission has therefore decided to launch the 'Dialogue on Europe' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people. This initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.4387802363888798
During the IGC I will have the honour of representing the Commission together with Mr Prodi and of working closely with your two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos. All the Commissioners have undertaken to use some of their time when they go to any country or region, and not just their own, which in my case happens three or four times a month, to engage in direct dialogue with the public, and not just with the élite or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course.	1.3214588511535355
We also plan to establish direct contacts in universities, schools and factories, to meet the people, answer their questions and listen to them. In this way we will play our part, as will you, in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do.	1.3857967243395188
We hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament.	1.1312461992940792
We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work.	1.0989215814945603
We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organisations, socio-professional organisations and the media.	0.9607699393279496
Opinion multipliers, political groups and parties, MEPs and national MPs, elected representatives, as I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved.	1.2994563322049328
Need I remind you that the European Parliament itself took the initiative on 1 February? I must again thank Mr Napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are, of course, the representatives of the people in each Member State.	1.3132763350865855
The Commission will propose that the Member States become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership.	1.1745409548265267
We are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the European Union Presidency and the European Parliament.	1.317381074399885
I have indicated the conditions under which the Commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits.	0.914708966804708
We want to encourage debate among the people.	0.9138890934797776
Without presuming to lecture you - God forbid - or even advise you, may I just point out that, when it was my honour to be Minister for European Affairs in my own country, I saw the need to establish a direct dialogue with the people? Each week, when engaging in this dialogue in each region, I realised that there was a real need for the European Union to have a face.	1.5302006224967064
I therefore took a European Commissioner, and not just the French ones, or ambassadors posted in Paris or MEPs to engage in this dialogue each week. This made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected, listened to and informed.	1.303988920005753
So this is what we are going to do.	1.1177964498798767
We will have a budget of approximately EUR 4 million for 2000 which you will hopefully approve.	1.229563756054234
Financing from the 2001 budget must also be negotiated as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both 2000 and 2001. It will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the Intergovernmental Conference and the ratification process.	1.2488351344684174
We will launch this dialogue on 8 March in Brussels in the presence of 700 young Commission stagiaires.	0.9286446146553449
Your President, Mrs Fontaine, has agreed to take part with Mr Prodi and several Commissioners in this initial dialogue. I can assure you that, whenever a Commissioner intends to engage in dialogue, the most immediately available MEPs will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the European Parliament.	1.4672622529134354
That is all I have to say for the moment.	1.4312491286161173
I welcome any questions, suggestions or proposals from the Members present.	0.8359349185131663
Colleagues, you know the rules.	1.383314045956618
You are expected to ask questions, not necessarily make lengthy statements.	1.170969301743886
You have one minute each in which to ask your question.	0.9610633828840083
Mr President, I think I also speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that I chair, in expressing my appreciation of this Commission initiative.	1.4891709685815693
Moreover, this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November.	1.4390273398632285
I have also heard Commissioner Barnier' s clarification of relations and links with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme.	1.2330798108961087
If I may make a suggestion, Commissioner Barnier, would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject, in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the European Parliament?	1.4050069780975059
It would be helpful to stress this convergence of intentions and efforts because I can see a particular problem with coordination, specifically between the Commission initiative - which certainly does not only address members of national parliaments, but also members of national parliaments - and our committee' s programme. Following the working meeting of 1 February, which Commissioner Barnier referred to and which benefited from the weighty contribution of the Commission, the committee intends to take stock of developments at the Intergovernmental Conference at all of its meetings.	1.5137510941732988
We therefore hope to benefit from the capable and consistent participation of members of national parliaments at all of our meetings, and this will be a channel which will ably supplement the ones in the Commission' s initiative.	1.3108068668966038
Thank you, Mr Napolitano.	0.9698214361287371
I can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of 18 November.	1.1492352412965825
I also want at this stage to say that I was able to propose this initiative to the Commission thanks to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague, Viviane Reding. This initiative was also established in conjunction with Günter Verheugen as it involves all the major challenges of enlargement, both its opportunities and risks, and of institutional reform.	1.443255587322111
These challenges must be explained to our citizens who are concerned about them and questioning them.	1.0202461125631774
I understand your concern, Mr Napolitano, and an interinstitutional working group will be set up. Its first meeting should take place in March.	1.56483043904485
I will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the Commission' s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other. I will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint.	1.4057712869108963
You realise that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned.	1.0201544791514001
Mr President, Commissioner, it is music to my ears to hear you use the word 'citizen' so often.	1.0927839641790689
We are increasingly concerned in this House about public opinion. The fear of public opinion is a rather paternalistic concept but our House is what it is and we must do what we can with it.	1.343119725805906
In terms of the IGC issue, I have a specific question for you. I believe that the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and OLAF.	1.5107431244441458
As you know, there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens.	1.2047518827915533
Given the urgency surrounding this issue, has the Commission considered the possibility of completely changing the structure of the anti-fraud office by moving to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud, in the Member States and in the European institutions, coming under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice?	1.262132426992783
Mr Dupuis, first of all I attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word 'citizen' .	1.136698196775596
It is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used.	1.2135593803878397
We will conduct this dialogue with our citizens, including the most disadvantaged and those isolated from decision-making or information centres.	1.1336467477857743
With regard to the IGC and this issue of the fight against fraud, and specifically fraud against the Community budget and interests, we have retained the idea in our proposals of creating a new and specific post of a European public prosecutor. We have done this in the spirit of this House' s work and perhaps by going down the same road.	1.4969178873243736
This public prosecutor would have the authority, recognised by the EU Treaty and therefore by the Member States, to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the Community budget and interests.	1.26293264132179
We can clearly and almost clinically see that legal cooperation is now no longer enough to fight against this fraud whether it originates from inside or outside the Community. This is why we have proposed the creation of a European public prosecutor who could, having investigated a case from start to finish, then have this investigated and ruled on by the most appropriate national court.	1.2673302571909375
In reply to your second point on the Court of Justice, we have not yet established our position on the Court of Justice because we were waiting for the Dur report which was published a few days ago.	1.230401769565758
The Commission, as I have promised, will complete its proposals on the IGC opinion about the legal system and the Court of Justice within the next few weeks.	1.4916453972453105
Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the day before yesterday, there was a leading news item in the most popular Danish news programme, which I would ask you to comment on.	1.5883423064644628
The story went that an official in the Commission had apparently told an Austrian businessman that, because he was Austrian, he would possibly be excluded from being able to participate in a scientific development project together with businesses in other countries, including Denmark.	1.350067915363973
I would ask you to confirm that, if an official has said that an Austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects, then this official has got the wrong end of the stick, and that, if he has not said this, then there is no story.	1.4847557461395269
Will you confirm what is the case?	1.3093842210899518
Mr Haarder, to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing.	1.176679672604746
My personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the Austrian people, businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in Austria of a new government coalition.	1.2268223896321324
Therefore, subject to verification which I or someone else will give immediately after this sitting, I can confirm what you have just said, that the Commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort.	1.267271423668129
Generally speaking, there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in Austria. I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957.	1.4486390368391333
This is an economic community, of course, but it is also, primarily, a community of values.	1.554201246175665
This is why we are drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis. This is why we have Article 13 of the EC Treaty on discrimination which we proposed, in our opinion of 26 January even before the Austrian crisis, should be applied after the IGC by qualified majority rather than by unanimity.	1.2680875582977207
This is why I personally have an idea to supplement Article 7 of the EU Treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis. Finally, this is why we have public debate.	1.4612796126966126
The only way to eliminate misconceived ideas is to offer alternatives, which brings me back to the subject of our discussion. I firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate, particularly to fight against demagoguery.	1.4168109806729006
Commissioner Barnier, you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe.	1.1581995644653995
With reference to the IGC, as you know, under the Helsinki decisions the Portuguese Presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC.	1.2658934687643248
Clearly, Parliament has its own representatives present, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos.	1.1944965103136982
But would you, Commissioner, also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the Council you would report this to Parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you, with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress?	1.4487228040198918
Mr Beazley, my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise.	1.2601285268936073
Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and many other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and even more MEPs in this House know that, on behalf of the Commission, I will be available to tell you how things are going as they happen throughout these negotiations, in a spirit of transparency.	1.3957657080992472
I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that, in many cases, we will say this together.	1.3873546441820934
It is very important that these negotiations is not secretive with the European Parliament or the national parliaments which, when all said and done, will have their opinions to give and their positions to take in the ratification process.	1.418277202935458
This is why I congratulate Mr Napolitano' s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the Fifteen and the European Parliament.	1.3747368554761388
Having said that, the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions.	1.1977634182348231
I will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year.	1.298594880461669
Mr President, firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach.	1.423714505656689
I think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage. This did not really happen for the Treaty of Amsterdam or the Treaty of Maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust.	1.4076815541927141
I have two questions. Firstly, you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission.	1.4593849998475001
Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well, that is to say via the television and Internet?	1.0605388234355242
My second question is of a critical nature.	0.8931844166363339
The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency.	1.3585320710974174
If I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands, then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model, and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands.	1.2898193443933303
My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this.	1.2796863174449067
Mrs Maij-Weggen, given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC, it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now.	1.3173862892988808
The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible.	1.224512084990539
The documents will in the main be open working documents.	0.9331572737333492
Although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media, I am committed, as I must be at this stage, to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission' s viewpoint.	1.5788258035669562
I can confirm, and thank you for having asked me about this, that we will use all the most modern means, television in particular, to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe.	1.3421352489697265
We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums.	0.7560245960216961
The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised.	0.9261318585583959
These are the modern means to be used.	1.322988623345089
However, I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people.	1.3364177209347101
Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal, I want a Commissioner, when he can, an MEP, a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe.	1.5580559899687219
I have evidence that this is possible.	1.0467997155953301
The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions.	0.8808104530481298
Although this may seem rather egotistical, I want the Commission, in the minds of the people, to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible.	1.5467429427658286
Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say.	1.2964556392776811
I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire, a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding.	1.3925292815713444
He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner.	0.8607089786042617
I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign?	1.547098679924301
In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be.	1.331168516677852
That is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist.	1.2090266016618465
The Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign.	1.2712702522432289
Mr Corbett, thank you for your comments.	0.90248232516306
I willingly accept your invitation. If I have understood you correctly, you want me, when I come to Yorkshire, to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds.	1.5343520315818238
I can perform this dual task.	0.5923008152902524
I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments, as I have already done, not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ.	1.3055717471138595
Ten days ago I was in Westminster, so you can see, Mr Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties.	1.649346627307438
Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin.	0.8483701676126144
I have already appeared before the French Senate.	1.0900174913190652
Therefore, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will go directly to see the national parliaments too.	1.5696812857558735
With regard to the dialogue with our citizens, it is not a question of propaganda or marketing, nor even of communication.	1.3206128239419463
I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue. So, after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform, those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion.	1.3616012555119088
I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States. I sincerely hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate.	1.3829149980752662
Mr President, I should like to join Mr Barnier' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with.	1.199931699646115
It is not much fun, of course, having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself.	1.4101316499494292
In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier said, during his presentation in Parliament, that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but, when I look at page 63, I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say, the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination, the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and, with a few exceptions, of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting.	1.5403620249921488
Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States' election processes?	1.0283454338180704
It is, of course, these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments.	1.163796489084937
Can such matters be controlled from Brussels?	0.679858616449893
Is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning?	0.9047558745822726
I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference, not merely to relations between the Union and Member States, but also the Union, the Member States, regions and cities.	1.4288175156858292
I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe, Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears.	1.3024111879236333
Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms.	1.346029487025908
Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this type, form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki?	1.2671563358632505
I do not think so.	0.7520911288814713
Are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion, unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking?	0.9516474748596908
Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission.	1.4218000534956028
I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated.	1.2892414929338847
In terms of social protection, I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology.	1.2524524400742336
In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people.	1.3241805392288797
This will therefore be our rule.	0.8340682662608223
We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic.	1.2687664211055938
I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues.	0.9548380030480437
I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical.	1.3805138220074873
This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27.	1.4884258914950892
Mr MacCormick, I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals.	1.363056559830113
It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots.	1.0784982758096662
If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity.	1.3824109658134318
We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions.	1.0255008060817292
Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this.	1.2905186464640555
It specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam.	1.2382178547273022
It also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies.	1.0498025364852281
The Commission is acting correctly if, on a particular point, it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions. I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7.	1.6079957901059416
However, if we do, this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the Union must mobilise together to give their response. We will also do this with regard for the future in general.	1.582950060607429
We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War.	1.4266663595633295
Everything which can be done will be useful. I am sure that you and I, Mr Berthu, can at least agree on this.	1.5086167001438602
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
You have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to.	0.9161041018117688
You have set a very good example of time-keeping today.	1.0848789795025207
That concludes the debate.	0.19308667519260808
Question Time (Commission)	0.3763026442786636
The next item is Question Time (B5-0009/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	1.0782099889813532
First part	-0.0
Question No 36 by (H-0025/00):	0.6844402676938183
Subject: High infant mortality in Kosovo According to the latest UN data received from the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe; almost 50% of babies born prematurely die, while the war has produced a steep rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm.	0.9975808093658877
In the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the Union and the efforts of its envoy Bernard Kouchner, will the Commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of Kosovo's right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women, women in childbirth and babies?	1.2355628170199924
Mr President, the Commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in Kosovo, not just for pregnant women but across the board.	1.3448754124427522
This results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it.	0.9106909124116
The statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable.	0.8470640074760862
However, the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population.	1.3802960367199177
The Commission' s response has been as follows: firstly, the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of ECHO funding.	1.2963253982529308
ECHO is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care, on support to institutions as well as vaccination.	1.1726346493846582
However, efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province.	1.3030420492970947
UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field.	0.9986699501964869
Secondly, under the reconstruction programme, urgent intervention at the hospital in Mitrovica has already been initiated with a EUR 1 million rehabilitation programme.	1.2335461154029195
Progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city.	0.9573378622348259
However, the Commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of UNMIK for this project.	1.3504687946454854
We hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation.	1.125058075675591
Under the European Community' s damage assessment, estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million.	1.0270403461601667
The Commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds.	1.2563556311658515
We expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system.	0.7862683493221619
The emphasis will be on long-term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement.	1.042117199598503
Work is already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise.	1.1794096586034568
Commissioner, this morning President Prodi, among others, stressed that the Balkans are testing our ability to act effectively, the very credibility of the European Union is on trial, and the gap between words and deeds must finally be closed.	1.478427018944647
Commissioner, do you really think that the facts we have about high infant mortality in Kosovo - the highest in Europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevails in Kosovo, are not already damaging our credibility and casting doubt on our ability to live up to our promises?	1.3101151373409017
Besides, Commissioner, is so-called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in Kosovo?	1.2389064875412774
Do you think that so much inaction is excusable when, on the continent of Europe itself, the right to life is at risk?	1.2948158835826489
I do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it, which have been working incredibly hard in Kosovo, would regard it as an adequate description of their labours to suggest that they had been standing idly by.	1.2790256772736777
I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that.	1.340469821288347
Of course, she is entirely correct in saying that the Union' s credibility is on the line with what happens, not just in Kosovo but in the Balkans as a whole.	1.4536751771611647
I am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance.	1.2380793162052102
I would just make two points about the situation in Kosovo which we are addressing as enthusiastically as we can along WHO lines.	1.2793594694442187
First of all, I am sure that the honourable Member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in Belgrade underfunded the health service in Kosovo, and many Albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all.	1.3172099731159277
As a result of that, a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society.	1.257192664673461
So what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under-investment.	1.1798990414152508
Secondly, and I am sure that the honourable Member recognises this as well, some of the tragic stories to come out of Kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child mortalities during carriage of a baby, but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born.	1.2643415441853751
Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities, or before the hostilities, tragically killed their own children.	1.1152824397656456
We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo.	0.639918916891349
We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour, but it is not going to be easy.	1.3709993057173335
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your response to the Member' s first question and the supplementary question.	1.3550614306602793
However, I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO, among others, are often of inferior quality.	1.168986442068688
In some cases, there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like.	0.8317798688320857
Are you aware of this?	0.7663119388400025
Are you prepared to act upon it?	0.7650385839669844
This is my first additional question.	0.8374779884398664
My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica.	1.071217830475207
You are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the Northern part of the city and that, given the tense situation, Albanian Kosovars do not have any access to this section at all.	1.2265737211827306
What does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital?	0.9312283616292621
On the first question, I am going myself to Kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and I will certainly look into the allegation made by the honourable Member about the ECHO food package.	1.293792808214549
I have not heard that suggestion before, but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there.	1.3887341629751822
Secondly, I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica.	1.365767103567966
I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago, I saw the situation there for myself.	1.4272637591578103
I had discussions with municipal leaders from both communities, including the leader of the Albanian side who had himself in the past been a doctor and was generally recognised for the medical work he had done during the hostilities and subsequently.	1.1353044913173398
So I know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in Kosovo, whatever ethnic group they come from.	1.3859134536106545
The particular difficulties in Mitrovica - for example, it is not just a question of Albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital, Albanian staff have had difficulty working there - are particularly acute problems.	1.1911890284526907
We will try to address them, but it is not easy.	1.2310818165134283
Question No 37 by (H-0029/00):	0.6974754798083078
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Commission taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	0.874822348317242
The Commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries.	1.0941764512970253
In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.	1.0953247346296549
Mr President, the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union.	1.4649235121264839
Will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because, in the final analysis, we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the European Union?	1.2334972991857558
My question therefore is this: will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions?	1.3154632367547658
The key issue is to support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk group to find a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can.	1.0944436596740343
We have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia.	1.0461984960051771
Let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union.	0.8503922584065214
The situation of Turkey's relations with its neighbours will, as the honourable Member asks, be closely examined in the framework of the pre-accession strategy.	1.269095370464859
As stated in Agenda 2000 - and I quote: "Enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts".	1.1661641120843238
That statement could not be much clearer.	0.7978407706681657
But I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results.	1.3390959749985019
Question No 38 by (H-0040/00):	0.6212740193665086
Subject: Implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey Given that Turkey has recently been granted applicant country status, what is the Commission's view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam, given the massive displacement of the Kurdish and the other people of the region that will result?	1.3290327113096356
The Commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the region.	1.2180173406329076
We will, however, consider raising the matter with the Turkish authorities, together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey.	1.3411024624482697
I have a related point.	0.9763504463769914
It concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole.	1.0298307643854934
As you know, the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to Syria and to Iraq in particular.	0.9705546199146503
Given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many commentators that we will see an increased incidence of conflict, of so-called "water wars", in the coming decades, what is the Commission's view about the potential destabilisation, both in Turkey and in the wider region, that will be caused by this dam?	1.4343140204322133
Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well?	0.9847159233676473
We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member.	0.9156430871471134
We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up.	1.2461801793715024
There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area.	0.9695498890575924
We will raise that, too, in the representations we make.	1.2285804224617263
A number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern, such as the effect on displaced farmers.	1.0434591426377138
On the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the Commission is participating in any form.	1.4957324321570598
Question No 39 by (H-0036/00):	0.6184671037994282
Subject: Drafting of Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	1.0297689772579974
What are the Commission's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	0.7393118971578216
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)	0.8426367060470018
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	0.7550903031848539
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	0.6081512802432385
What are the Commission's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	0.7920208453991462
Like the honourable Member, the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government to start the process of drawing up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In the conclusions of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even established the broad outlines of the Charter' s content.	1.2645806866204206
According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights. The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.	1.3848555109194138
The second is the rights reserved for citizens of the European Union. The third is economic and social rights, as contained in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the Union.	1.3944948255983176
The Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given by the Cologne European Council.	0.9765183940110457
Having said that, this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources.	1.0656818368895566
As I have said before in this House, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances, particularly technological and social changes.	1.5261372196399012
However, given the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submitted to the Heads of State and Government, this power must be exercised with caution and on a case-by-case basis.	1.2857063235632853
The rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary.	0.9447527028311022
Some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union.	1.0440503507959138
It may also be envisaged that some economic and social rights could be guaranteed only for citizens of the European Union and third-country nationals meeting certain conditions.	1.250400037183237
It is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the Charter to prejudge its content in more detail.	1.1429159458751073
However, I can confirm that the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment between men and women will certainly be included among the rights guaranteed by the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is because this principle already figures among the rights guaranteed by the EC Treaty and by secondary legislation and because it undoubtedly constitutes a common constitutional tradition in the Member States.	1.220381137522115
As I have also said before to this House, the Commission is favourable to inserting the Charter in the EU Treaty.	1.62205685797597
However, we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the Heads of State and Government.	1.3213324078625721
The difficult part, which will fall to the Convention, is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the Treaties.	1.4090887544589759
In its opinion on the holding of an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties, the Commission noted that the European Council must decide during the year 2000 on the inclusion of certain items on the IGC agenda, in particular the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.3880112782025633
Commissioner, it is quite significant that at the beginning of this new century people in Europe, men and women, are being called upon to redefine their rights and obligations.	1.3958783535743648
We hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality.	1.0999453991031343
Globalisation on the one hand and enlargement on the other, make it urgently necessary to define those rights.	1.128958720690807
Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting.	1.4354179403646496
But if we are to secure the public' s participation in this new planning, we would like to learn what plan the European bodies and specifically the Commission are proposing as the social and democratic model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	1.2861019370274114
I listened to your general guidelines and I would like to ask you what is the position of children, as entities in their own right, in the Commission' s plans for the new model of society in the twenty-first century.	1.4303509016443956
Mr President, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, in my opinion, and as Mr Prodi said this morning, the drawing up of the Charter is an exercise with great political significance. This is because it shows that the Union places the fundamental rights of citizens at the top of the political concerns for the future of our common project.	1.5514620744406218
In this context, the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated.	1.164548734137106
The essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the European institutions, as contained in the European project enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union.	1.5223621222490475
I understand your concern about the rights of children.	0.7671679059820431
Many elements of our work, and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, involve protecting the rights of children.	1.2178184625532171
This is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully.	1.2092860314102523
Each Member State is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children.	0.936525658810988
As for the EU' s responsibility, the rights of children must be recognised in the Charter according to the areas in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship, in its broadest sense, of children.	1.498247917797244
I hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable Member has posed for the Commission and the whole Convention.	1.3216552156425418
Mr President, I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach.	1.3987476832532126
However, I should like to ask a slightly different question.	1.3026625205371174
We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issues that the Community is dealing with this year.	1.369279575933675
Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter?	1.5063840477976198
It is very important that the people feel engaged in this process.	1.1166402600024197
I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has.	1.5945309835990162
Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate?	1.112321439435895
It is the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far-reaching as the Charter is.	1.4749220231735378
I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.1592146619819805
We can achieve the best of both worlds by having a clear text, a text that can be easily read by the citizens, and at the same time a text that can be used as a legal instrument.	1.3248049331907341
There is no contradiction between the two.	1.0872836104080956
The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter.	1.1768020098078287
I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here.	1.1466294848809564
Question No 40 by (H-0095/00):	0.6508713284044977
Subject: Articles 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	1.2860540020798106
It is clear from statements over the past years that Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria.	1.1063274361001587
Therefore, will the Commission state when they intend to propose under Article 7.1 that there is 'the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6.1.' , and urge the Council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this Treaty to Austria including the voting rights of the representative of Austria in the Council?	1.2803948334810926
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the Commission with regard to the formation of the new Austrian Government. This was reiterated this morning in President Romano Prodi' s speech on that government which includes Ministers from Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party.	1.2102864313737107
I am referring ,of course, to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000, the basic elements of which I would like to restate.	1.6341852949792242
The Commission confirmed then, as it does today, that it shares the concerns underlying the Portuguese Presidency' s statement of 1 February 2000.	1.5362198579636062
These concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them.	0.9602989934915751
There is no need for me to remind you of Jörg Haider' s political bias and of his many xenophobic and racist public statements, which are also anti-European.	1.3001289754752536
The fact that an openly extremist, racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a Member State of the European Union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other States that are taking part in the European project. The European Commission is certainly not indifferent to the matter either.	1.421300476884694
Secondly, the Commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaties, specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union.	1.1736732234802023
One of the most important innovations provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam was to clarify the basic principles which represent the shared heritage of the Member States. Another innovation was the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principles are being fulfilled, and which would react if any of them were violated.	1.3065125719001665
The Commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars: that of the rule of law.	0.9773742812206173
This principle means that the Commission must act within the limits laid down by the Treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 February was made.	1.4837969139606826
The Commission is not a State. It cannot and must not act as if it were one.	1.562647713385497
In order to give a precise answer to your question, Mr Ford, I must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union to be applied, there must be proof of the existence and I quote, of a "serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6."	1.4223790613402718
I repeat, a "serious and persistent breach" is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State.	1.372643502932033
I think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in Austria.	1.257951616306987
As a matter of fact I think that I am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of a serious and persistent breach of human rights and of democracy are never fulfilled, either in Austria or in any other Member State.	1.3360362079537857
I would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the Commission, as stated once again by President Prodi this morning, to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in Article 7.	1.3868494690746749
I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary.	1.0533456546778286
The values at stake are too central, too fundamental for us to accept dithering or compromises.	1.0697650748540997
Individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say.	1.0485562577061167
In Austria' s case, the statements are contradictory to say the least.	0.9799969807415565
On the one hand, any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the Freedom Party.	1.1087249572600704
On the other hand, the new Austrian Government' s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights.	1.1063874629819141
We will soon have our first opportunity, and an excellent opportunity it will be, to see which one of these two faces of the Freedom Party is the real one.	1.6053731567556224
I am referring to the position the Austrian Government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission' s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives.	1.46831596948919
One applies to the principle of treating people equally, without differentiating on the grounds of race or ethnic origin. The other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin, religion, handicap or sexual persuasion.	1.1632478594746753
These are significant texts, adopted in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty, which gave the Community jurisdiction to fight discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, sex etc.	1.2357271589537047
Lastly, I would like to assure you, Mr Ford, that the Commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities, should it prove necessary.	1.3534961101607068
I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question.	0.9868422542721159
But is Commissioner Vitorino aware, not only of Mr Haider's and the Freedom Party's words, but also of their deeds?	1.4419694259869198
Mr Haider has actually been in government in the southern province of Carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovene-speaking minority in that region who are Austrian citizens, where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the Roma and immigrant communities.	1.1549984108331808
Could the Commissioner answer two questions.	0.586795165838213
Firstly he talked about verification.	0.5413275885383436
Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it?	1.180827934742341
Secondly, does he not agree that were the current government, at a national level, to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level, then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6(1) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action?	1.493640252957856
We are not talking about words here.	0.9360277603175976
We are talking about deeds by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider.	0.9629841877682653
It is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the Commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Member States according to the procedures and standards that are enshrined in Article 6 and justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty.	1.291083558301675
Therefore I am fully confident that the Commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in Austria, as in any other Member State.	1.2904657343048735
If any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one Member State occurs, we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly.	1.113260040301812
I also rely not only on the cooperation of the Members of the European Parliament, but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organisations, which have always made an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the Commission.	1.212672348551252
Regarding the situation in Carinthia, we need to look at this in detail.	1.3469405571244437
The honourable Member raised the question.	0.6944565156926347
The protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the Commission has put before the Council.	1.2981960932433854
We should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question.	1.1953772495644541
That question calls for reflection, for debate and, if necessary, for action.	1.3878632116715346
I sincerely hope that all Member States will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directives that the Commission has presented to the Council to reiterate in clear and concrete terms their approval for the action plan and for the directives and their commitment to fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur.	1.4326872159578103
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino, for your valuable contribution to this Question Time.	1.3745747645064639

Questions to Mrs Wallström	0.33923132750227064
Question No 41 by (H-0021/00):	0.7262550849201995
Subject: Surplus electrical and electronic equipment Each year the European Union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment (6 million tonnes' worth in 1998), mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent.	1.3181662863543193
The environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances (lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chrome, PVC and halogenated flame retarders).	0.881152115634418
A preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions, the most recent of which dates from July 1999.	1.185601082578861
Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft, which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998?	1.1757778746995011
Is it true that the US Government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the World Trade Organisation (for infringement of Article XI of the GATT and Article 2(2) of the Agreement on technical obstacles to trade) if it is adopted?	1.2069300527858848
The Commission agrees with MEPs that the current method of dumping electrical and electronic waste is causing major environmental problems.	0.9720230170905746
Consequently, the Commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and, since 1997, has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned.	1.6538231528927008
The outcome of the discussions, as well as of the in-depth investigations which are being carried out in this area, are now being examined by the Commission.	1.3809924331794843
Some parts of the proposal have been criticised, among them the phasing out of some heavy metals and brominated flame retardants, as well as the application of the principle of making manufacturers responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste.	1.084872584031872
The United States' delegation to the European Union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper, inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned, as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers' responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste.	1.2156328132575382
The main argument put forward by the United States in this context is that the present provisions are, they say, incompatible with international trade law.	1.4449053983295492
The Commission is currently carefully reviewing the United States' arguments.	1.3502057026341914
I should just like to add that my intention is that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before Easter.	1.2015453531294
My question specifically concerned the reaction of the US Government to the text of the preliminary draft.	0.9082386702582994
There have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one, to my knowledge, dating from July 1999.	1.1291656936894479
Is this the text which you will be submitting, or an amendment to the original version?	1.4347850168656637
Version 3 is already much weaker than Version 2 following the comments of US industry as relayed by the US Government.	0.9563449546353243
I note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible, you are referring in fact to the rules of the World Trade Organisation.	1.3693053559829453
The arguments of the US Government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the WTO rules.	1.2223840621250048
This worries me because this means that, when adopting texts, we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the World Trade Organisation. This will fundamentally weaken European environmental legislation and particularly this proposal.	1.3533526230513404
Thank you for the follow-up question.	0.9903045900942316
It is important for me to have a chance to answer it.	1.2973752293380385
It is clear that in a process such as this, where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe, there is an on-going dialogue between the different parties concerned.	1.512914089231839
The dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal.	1.020416420904062
Parts of it have been strengthened, but other parts may well contain too many compromises.	1.1168072967396065
We are still in the process of preparing a text, and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment.	1.41557933064155
I do not think that the intervention of the United States should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations.	1.1417409630190918
I strongly oppose using the WTO and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the EU from introducing radical environmental standards.	0.8623557718977942
I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these.	1.131232786942473
However, I do want to listen to all the points of view.	1.329212637119446
For example, I recently met representatives of the electronics industry who put forward suggestions - including practical ones - for improving our own proposal.	1.3615133324985067
However, I totally reject any suggestion that I would allow the United States to determine the shape of our directive.	1.373562691610322
In fact, I believe that we should be showing the way, an intention that will also characterise the final proposal.	1.3320200564529006
Question No 42 by (H-0026/00):	0.6701941376120895
Subject: Gender and environment Practically all the contributors involved in the Rio and Kyoto processes - individual organisations, civic action groups, governments, the World Bank, the UN and relief organisations - believed that women should take a greater part in decision-making on the environment.	1.2700528726813347
More women in decision-making positions on various environmental bodies would extend the predominantly male terms of reference beyond business alone to embrace social justice as well.	0.9262066463397739
Is the Commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision-making in the environmental field?	1.1455636790728787
In 1988, the Commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men.	1.3948633918839002
Through the current programme, which covers the period 1997 to 2000, we are endeavouring to encourage a workplace culture in which the value of both men and women is integrated and where gender-specific needs are taken into consideration.	1.283638618963015
One of the programme's aims is to develop and supervise methods, strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision-making process and in positions of responsibility.	1.170745050023912
Within the framework of the action plan, each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures.	1.0963794216403042
One of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions.	1.1133140738859768
The new Commission's own objective is to double the number of women managers before the end of its term of office.	1.189509696477681
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women.	1.0676630272942846
Our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions.	1.1395596050806658
Currently, women hold 24.5 per cent of our A-grade posts, and we hope the number will increase steadily.	1.2993190392206615
Moreover, we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups.	1.4632883067452516
As regards our external partners, all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to democratise their decision-making processes.	1.1777720333003936
With respect to the general principle of incorporating a perspective of equality, as you know, this principle is included in the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1.1411806228084478
Article 3 of the Treaty states that, in all the activities referred to in this Article, the Community shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between women and men.	1.6734093400844465
The Commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field.	1.1711338610882593
I should, of course, like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role played by the European Parliament' s Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, particularly its chair.	1.075278584002862
I should just like to recall that, during the lengthy process of approving the present Commission, every Commissioner was questioned by the Women' s Committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field.	1.2111308690771685
We shall be monitoring each Commissioner carefully, so the other Commissioners have now been forewarned.	1.312022497942554
Thank you for your reply.	0.5091778424529624
I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields.	1.0952180189103535
I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes.	1.0318726710472717
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work.	0.9917896810960488
I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes.	1.143406524120068
This is a crucial goal.	1.4059220648294908
In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required.	1.2359973955158436
.	-0.0
(SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do.	1.3379233591658377
In the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General, issues of equality play a very important role.	1.2130482587121447
For example, I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission.	1.2716043956895426
If we are to be able to motivate everybody, I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or, if you prefer, from the bottom up.	1.405363811614724
My impression of environment-related work, broadly speaking, is that in many instances it is dominated by women.	1.251979913646395
This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field.	0.998353582929463
I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention, but there is certainly room for improvement.	1.2563297113946126
I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up.	0.8784221036571283
I hope that this will be of benefit.	1.2685441246233236
Question No 43 by (H-0045/00):	0.8169244138688353
Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance.	0.9435667607171612
However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission's insistence.	1.2242339352936502
What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation.	1.2441513397817652
How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area?	1.1461506944859965
Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area?	1.1491087239671285
The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour, but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member.	1.3283862023651494
The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan.	0.8972040262286399
The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive.	0.550492717951741
That means that any development that takes place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the Community' s Habitats Directive.	1.232780763798173
Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan, which are now designated a part of the special protection area, and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed.	1.3773309812688526
After investigating these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the Structural Funds - the Commission became convinced, in the summer of 1999, that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour.	1.3643215404655558
An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out.	0.891864291589194
The most serious harm caused by the project, the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats, was only to be temporary, and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats.	1.2657126813041155
At the Commission's suggestion, the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area, from which they had previously been excluded.	1.287506246211015
Furthermore, to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats, the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved.	1.2720909362817423
However, since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute.	1.487453130675501
Firstly, the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements.	1.0841030716118134
They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts.	0.8824921732214831
However, the new commitment included some minor changes which, in turn, led to a further complaint.	1.3814867656680543
In view of the fact that the Irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved, the Commission will not, for the present, propose that financial support from the Structural Funds should be suspended.	1.432878936713805
However, it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities, particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts.	1.1492264930349876
- I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said.	1.5268343454818973
The mudflat at Stregrennan, which was made a special protection area at the request of the Commission, has been completely destroyed at this stage.	1.2774812242047866
It is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives.	0.9915657571179737
You say there will be no further funding.	1.0039716078804968
I would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation.	1.2772116026213278
If not, why not?	0.616959217326673
If you are, when exactly are you going to do it?	1.4671312455161065
Is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence, and also the authority which basically takes the money from the EU and gives it to a company that it owns 100%?	1.2018489732080173
Is this right and proper?	0.7514939915601762
What is your opinion on that?	0.7969482934685723
Any EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of EU directives.	1.110434184635975
Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed.	0.9293091038927981
Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done.	1.1318076828988777
The first legal challenge followed the start of work on the port of development in early autumn 1999 without the compensatory habitat improvements being in place.	0.9864551840794116
As a result, the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means.	1.02477675316428
The use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge - that is what I referred to also in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlying mudflats and would cause the ecologically-harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary.	1.1898836939981046
There is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge.	1.0174738338330538
The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities, and does not require prior Commission approval.	1.320951485353657
The Commission' s role is to make sure that the standards required by the Birds Directive are fully met, and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging.	1.388741804992731
In this case, the Commission proposes to seek further clarification from the Irish authorities on the up-to-date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass.	1.0994100328284264
We are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the Structural Funds.	1.2650182414051807
Mr President, sadly, the specific case raised by Mrs McKenna is not an isolated one.	1.4664108148580888
There are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of EU funding.	1.0788575959396813
Will the Commission consider issuing instructions to all Member States saying that, if in future it discovers that European environmental directives have been breached or proper environmental assessment has not been carried out, it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already granted, in other words, reclaim the money from the Member States?	1.2208706305626966
It is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future.	1.027756015989445
.	-0.0
(SV) This is a very important question.	1.4504996453131331
As MEPs are well aware, in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the Commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concerning the relationship between the Structural Funds, money from the Structural Funds and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives.	1.191281702606624
The message contained in the joint text is still valid.	1.1068353582317807
We cannot hand out money with one hand and, with the other, take countries to court, where they may well be fined. It is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy.	1.4583978650094414
The result may, of course, be some difficult questions of priorities.	1.0479804336961416
In my view, the most important consequence, however, is that countries should do some careful thinking and, above all, make sure they send in their lists of Natura 2000 sites.	1.2370882039131827
Then we will be in a position to carry out methodical monitoring and follow-up procedures.	1.1181288584737485
In that respect, Ireland falls short, like other Member States, but we hope that the pressure we are exerting will produce results.	1.4588825119456472
I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good.	1.003455093010755
The Rules of Procedure do not allow this.	0.9075678974058674
You will have to discuss this outside the Chamber.	1.1090361749816977

Question No 44 by (H-0020/00):	0.7034817422724704
Subject: Partnership arrangements and the third community support framework for Greece The recent Regulation (EC) 1260/1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds places greater emphasis than the previous regulation on stronger partnership, involving the regional and local authorities and other public bodies, the economic and social partners and all other relevant bodies not only in the preparation but also in the funding, monitoring and assessment of the measures taken.	1.2234519801975596
However, local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that 'partnership' arrangements under the new CSF for Greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance.	1.1376672863415789
Has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies?	1.1568651137724033
In what way have the local authorities be given a greater say in the preparation and administration of the third CSF and what steps will the Commission take to ensure greater participation by the 'partners' in all measures taken under the new CSF?	1.2839980059769667
May I quickly add something to the answer given just now by Mrs Wallström to Mr Martin?	0.9617897330154472
This was a joint letter between our two predecessors and I consider, as the successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies, that this letter is still valid. I will actively endeavour with Mrs Wallström to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the Structural Funds with the EU environmental directives and policies.	1.3644068716662079
I am also saying this as a former environment minister.	1.1571235349109608
Turning now to the question posed by Mr Alavanos, who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject, the Commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor, during the preparation of the new programming period, the application of the partnership principle.	1.481408238383085
The involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community' s action is, as you know, one of the essential elements of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation.	1.273302952143516
With regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece, the Commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the 2000-2006 period.	1.3416911606956394
Mr Alavanos knows that I have been to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster. During these visits, I held discussions with the Greek Government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement.	1.218981854885248
As for subsequent phases, in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes, it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level. It must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the CSF at national, regional and local level.	1.2572211843207237
As for the monitoring and management of these programmes, I have not yet received the national provisions proposed by the Greek Government pursuant to Article 8 of the new Regulation.	1.4349394264036375
In the current negotiations on this third Community support framework, I have asked for the provisions on the partnership principle to be fully respected, with regard to both regional and local authorities and to non-governmental organisations and associations.	1.3143260734360178
Within the third CSF, this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partners in the monitoring committee.	1.234217497105539
This is all I can say.	0.8884230775191178
I thank the Commissioner, and do not at all question his intentions and interventions, which adopted a positive line.	1.3559038715380403
However, things are really quite different.	1.5002287238314915
The operation of the Community Support Framework is ruled by a centralising hand and indeed at this time we are experiencing state, government and party delirium as regards the European Union' s funding.	1.333224873188974
I cannot show you the television programmes here but I can show you the Greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections.	0.9812761630546242
In the Sunday papers all over Greece: the Ministry of Public Works concerning the structural fund: the Minister' s work; the Ministry of Agriculture: the Minister' s work - just a few weeks before the elections - the Ministry of Telecommunications: the work of the Minister for Telecommunications; the Ministry of Education: the work of the Minister for Education and a photograph of the Minister; the Ministry of Employment: the work of the Minister for Employment, a photograph of the Minister and a photograph of the State Secretary, and behind them all the symbols of the Community Support Framework.	1.2369899703897815
There are only a few weeks to go before the elections.	1.110141827457333
This is both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidates, financed by the European Union, the CSF.	1.0614747204462833
My question to the Commissioner is this: what is to be done?	1.5196851285622006
Will the Commission remain silent?	0.752318228539183
Will it discuss the matter?	0.5551916089545204
Will it bring it up with the Greek Government or will we persist with the pathological situation we had with the previous Commission?	1.081399718090463
Mr Alavanos, I see that you have thrown to your left all the documents which you have just cited.	1.34975609121732
Would you let me have these documents so that I can read them, after I have had them translated? I can then determine what they contain in terms of information and communication, which I can only welcome as the Commissioner for Regional Policy, and what is propaganda.	1.598815872151764
Then if it is really necessary for me to do this, I will make comments or recommendations to the Greek Government.	1.3872812167523738
I would therefore be very pleased if you could pass me these documents or I will come and get them from you later on.	1.2766488232345377
Having said that, I thought your question related more to the partnership issue.	1.301565772707872
Further to your questions on the pre-electoral period, I can only repeat my intention that local and regional authorities should be involved together with non-governmental organisations.	1.2304726740677323
I can only quote what is contained in the general Structural Funds Regulation which specifies that the Commission will work with the governments of the Member States. It is therefore the Greek Government which is my primary partner.	1.4763566552605958
Subsequently, if I need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised, then I will do this.	1.4274346446711494
I cannot do other than work with the Greek Government.	0.8254144234229922
I think that my colleague Mr Alavanos will be giving all these particulars to the Commissioner so that he may be aware of them, because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting Community programmes.	1.4171359853943748
However, turning to the substance, I should like to ask the Commissioner to bear in mind the following: that for all national and regional programmes, Greece is regarded as a region which expresses itself - at the level of its partnership relations with the European Union - via its central administration, its central government.	1.414992563912624
From that point of view, neither local governments and much less non-governmental organisations, for example the farming cooperatives which would be interested in further development of the farming sector, have any involvement in the formulation of proposals for the third Community Support Framework, nor have they had any involvement in the previous CSFs.	1.1924167970983561
What can the Commission do about that?	0.8891613503815351
Mr Theonas, I can only repeat what I said to Mr Alavanos.	1.2756023546976976
I will monitor this situation very closely. If necessary, within and pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation, I will make comments on the use made, not of Structural Funds which are not yet committed, but of the negotiations prior to the allocation of these Structural Funds.	1.5349095415235285
However, I am obliged to respect the national authority with which I must conduct these negotiations.	1.3767162416276637
Having said this, I will look at the situation objectively.	1.3805721421240114
As for the rest, if you have any recommendations or suggestions on the involvement of a particular structure - I think you spoke of a cooperative structure - I am ready and willing, on the basis of suggestions from MEPs - you will be acting within your role and I within mine - to relay these suggestions, provided that they respect the spirit and letter of the Structural Funds Regulation.	1.4497882720674191
Why would I not say that we have noticed in previous years, on the part of the Greek Government, some shortcomings in the application of the new Regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society?	1.3954745693544817
I am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted, this must be remedied.	1.1735794628243563
I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework.	1.2670473180508892

Question No 45 by (H-0041/00):	0.6448059134680388
Subject: Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period, 1994-1999, no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas?	1.2370145162495965
Can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period?	1.2544562291733923
What role will aid from the Structural Funds play, on the other hand, in the promotion of renewable energy?	1.2293549381988533
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional, renewable energy sources?	1.1011037030821686
Will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission networks?	0.837863797773138
On Mrs Isler Béguin' s first point I must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the Community' s priorities during the previous programming period.	1.2153676162688176
The support allocated by the Structural Funds for technological cohesion, or research and technical developments, within the Community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately EUR 7.5 billion.	1.2554789044763683
This is about 6% of the whole Community contribution.	1.4528114096881168
With regard to your specific concern, I can say that, as in the previous period, the Commission does not intend to directly finance through the Structural Funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission.	1.355378234664024
However, it is still the responsibility of the Member States' management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these CSFs.	1.443554506168651
Consequently, even though this is not a Community priority, a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area, provided that these projects contribute to regional development. The Commission does not have to be systematically informed of these.	1.5716689542434126
On your second point of renewable energy which, as you know, is of great interest to me, the Commission' s approach is given in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds.	1.304546808374362
These Funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources, where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level.	1.1117766886477471
I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit I made to the Azores in Portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy.	1.2585408182243456
The Structural Funds contribution which has enabled greater penetration of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the Transport and Energy Department.	1.0860049118012798
Finally, on large-scale energy transmission networks, the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation.	1.2626373915386595
This is particularly valid for the region of the Azores which I have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions. It is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains, for example.	1.4409881974359475
Commissioner, thank you for your answer. However, I asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled 'International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor' .	1.2185766956899877
This project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for Structural Funds, such as those listed in Objective 1, might welcome this type of installation.	1.0293960195337923
We would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific 'nuclear research' context.	1.1995208609101433
You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	0.8544058147670872
Could you please give an answer on this issue?	1.0880963676614888
You are concerned about whether the Structural Funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere.	1.1515819305643178
Quite simply there is no question of this.	0.9242987938073683
I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation.	1.0634325047670983
As a result, the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected.	1.3544855650720138
However, you are right to question me as this is your task, as mine is to answer you.	1.4597445375645604
As has happened in the past, the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification.	1.1948862421712352
I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point.	1.3310160348656765
The Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible.	1.1204841699009112
I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	0.667513784076885
The energy situation varies widely from region to region in the European Union. Assistance from the Structural Funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions, particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped.	1.2134223456568614
This is the only answer I can give you on the link between large-scale energy transmission networks and the Structural Funds.	1.0166116366350082

Question No 46 by (H-0052/00):	0.7400837165570845
Subject: Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality, I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality.	1.5113769212741708
In particular, would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States, with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries?	1.20671625777529
Mr MacCormick, the Commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated, for the 2000-2006 period, in Article 11 of the general Regulation on the Funds.	1.5464945077568961
As in the past, these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State.	1.28002803569628
In this respect, it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional.	1.2763859966272195
The cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure.	1.1699445638814614
Provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected.	1.0516747181081003
As for the budgetary provisions within the Member States, between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries, these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules.	1.217648193767875
Please excuse this very legal answer.	0.6216203910089934
However, after verification it is precisely in this legal manner and specifically according to the post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle.	1.4744998905121283
- I am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content.	1.2903069585661455
We are left with Article 11(1) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States.	1.0428947821377483
Very well: that is to be the unchanging rule.	1.4770982062592377
Does section 11(1) conceivably authorise the following practice.	0.7978047113222746
When an autonomous region's or country's funding from European structural funds increases, the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region, so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union.	1.1219726480329115
Is that really authorised?	0.5248431842211574
Unfortunately I do not have time to go into depth on this issue. If Mr MacCormick would be satisfied with my partial agreement with his reasoning, I will give him a full answer in writing by restating the legal bases of both Article 11 in general and Article 11(1) in particular.	1.4260540570367475
I am aware of the Member' s competence on these matters.	1.2749976117113146
I also know the particular problems in your constituency in Scotland where disputes and discussions are occurring on these subjects.	0.9723670455918477
However, on a general level, I would say that in all cases it is the Structural Funds expenditure which must be additional. This is how, provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds can be added to the national expenditure and we can consider that the additionality principle is respected.	1.4602198969823952
I will go further in the written answer which I have promised in order to set things out more objectively and precisely.	1.204532035469649
- Additionality is a major issue too in Wales, which I represent.	1.2547315480405368
Just last week it was one of the issues that brought about a vote of no-confidence and the resignation of the First Secretary of the National Assembly of Wales.	1.2560515434105681
As recently as 1991 and 1992 the Commission won a battle with the UK over additionality, at that time linked to the RECHAR funding.	1.1120486466225392
This led to an agreement being signed whereby the UK Government agreed to introduce procedures to ensure that EU spending reached the areas for which is was intended and was actually additional.	1.149384565678644
And yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland.	1.1128315099253816
Could the Commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the UK Government?	1.406724026593099
I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales.	1.264365902440926
I will verify this point and, if you wish, I will give you a written answer at the same time as the one I have promised to Mr MacCormick.	1.4107078450717792
Question No 47 by (H-0088/00):	0.7717834173373123
Subject: Amount which Andalusia will receive from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period According to the Commission' s estimates and on the basis of the criteria established at the Berlin Summit (which include per capita GDP, the unemployment rate and the population census updated in accordance with the 1996 register of inhabitants), what amount is to be allocated to Andalusia from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period?	1.2886818798801456
Questions to Mr Bolkestein	0.5998167413901193
Mr President, I will try to be brief in answering the Member' s question. The regional development plan submitted by the Spanish authorities on 29 October does not indicate how the Community funds will be allocated among the Spanish Objective 1 regions and therefore what your region of Andalusia will receive.	1.2771347953644796
As I did not fully understand the plan, I contacted the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Mr Rato, in a letter of 14 December which I have here, to ask him for more information on the document submitted.	1.542908943012998
In the coming weeks, the Commission will start negotiations with the Spanish authorities with a view to drawing up the Community support framework for the new period of 2000-2006. During these meetings I can assure you that the Commission will obtain the clarifications required on the regional allocation.	1.4400388111100333
Therefore, if you wish, as soon as I have this information by sector and region, I will personally send you the information on Andalusia.	1.5494159969530499
Mr Commissioner, the problem is that when Mr Aznar comes to the European Union to receive money for all the people of Andalusia, he counts all of them, but when he goes to the Andalusia Council to pay for services, he fails to notice 400 000 Andalusians, and this is very serious, because 400 000 children are the equivalent to the whole of Strasbourg or a city larger than Granada, full of children.	1.4378420712327604
This question is very important and I would like to know - since this is a kind of 'baby fraud' - whether the Commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the Andalusians, so that the funds which the European Union are going to pay to Andalusia, based on the census, will take into account these 400 000 children which Aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services.	1.4397742295569969
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matters.	1.5440030194955527
I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are differing viewpoints.	1.3811059001920747
I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government.	1.1707013114599927
You may answer the question.	0.5716098163636012
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I hear that you have a strong voice. I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me.	1.424279380125174
I have given you my answer.	0.7121147892592761
I am keen that the Structural Funds, particularly those in Objective 1, are allocated where needed.	1.1917067210615442
We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive.	1.1765301511652322
I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country. I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation.	1.53879308076486
It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible.	1.0285046284288886
I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today.	1.4623975291074078
As I did not have an answer, I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December.	1.3027930166931205
I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it.	0.9967905703857101
I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and, in this case, passionate intervention.	1.1655954050742832
I would like to remind all of you that Spain is about to hold elections, and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections.	1.42030442114173
It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time, since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again.	1.4124657036583121
I do believe it is important to say that Andalusia is going to receive 50% more within the Community support framework and that Spain also holds the record for the use of the Structural Funds, which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different Community support frameworks.	1.2867957727874195
Lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question: Do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable?	1.24927924466044
This is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related.	1.1803125076279044
Having said this, we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union.	1.1474971859118093
I am pleased that the Structural Funds are the subject of discussions in Greece and Spain.	1.1384880311452246
We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens, about public debates.	1.1973285059015768
The more we talk about Europe and what Europe is doing for daily life, even when we disagree, the better this will be, provided that we talk about this objectively.	1.3791857498039142
I am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the Structural Funds Regulation.	1.1291254336913408
This Regulation was adopted just last year in Berlin and I will be applying it for the next seven years.	1.3111247351665785
We will talk about this issue during the cohesion report which I regard as an important time for making an assessment with and before this House and for outlining future prospects. The time will come at the beginning of next year for any amendments to be highlighted.	1.2079853785848342
For the time being, please let me apply the Regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in Berlin.	1.2599029566996547
This is all I can say today.	0.945954654909784
Thank you very much for your replies, Mr Barnier.	1.2836083764070245
Questions Nos 48 to 50 will be replied to in writing.	0.4659073833672202
Question No 51 by (H-0049/00):	0.7382905583698957
Subject: New premises for the OHIM At present the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) is still operating from the same temporary premises, even though its new building was opened in June 1999.	1.2322463512054866
In view of this unusual situation, will the Commission say why the OHIM has not yet moved to its new premises?	1.292990951249288
The honourable Member asked a question on this topic in November 1999 and I would like to refer him to the answer given at the time.	1.2040891458939493
Furthermore, I have asked the president of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, that is to say the Office in Alicante, to comment further on this new question and I can, as a result, inform the honourable Member as follows, on behalf of the Office:	1.4370709693581067
The Office is not yet ready to move into the new building.	1.065411496467664
Unfortunately, a number of deadlines have been exceeded.	1.225109013425682
A number of technical provisions need to be made, such as the installation of a computer network, archives, a canteen and furniture.	1.1344575004113353
The OHIM is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by June.	0.9308116346822005
During the previous question, we were discussing electoral issues.	1.4430421189278009
I believe that this issue is relevant to my question. Commissioner, you were not present at the extraordinarily named 'official opening' of the headquarters of the OHIM on 9 June, in the middle of an election campaign in Spain leading up to both the European elections and the local and regional elections.	1.3536150491168097
If you had been there, I am sure you would have been ashamed.	1.4484748965010128
The President of the Commission and some secretaries were present.	1.1411812896345837
In the middle of an election campaign, a series of authorities, all of them run by the party in government, made clearly electioneering speeches which, furthermore, were broadcast live on television.	1.271511328844977
It was bizarre to see the President of the Region of Valencia praising the work of the Spanish Government, as well as his own work, although it was irrelevant to that event.	1.3157524224030952
The opening of a building which was not finished, in the middle of an election campaign, which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied, makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous.	1.2539281545036585
I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish, because at the end of the day it was their responsibility, but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing, through its presence, this absurd event.	1.5540936873250542
I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Commissioner: does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be opened during an election campaign?	1.186055059882734
Does it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the Spanish Government?	1.079542565976672
It does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one Member State or another.	0.9771003277587705
As such, I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described.	1.370371451677308
I have to confess that I fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony was held in Spain.	0.9360148453098817
What I can say is that I hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible.	1.2724408313745248
May I also add that I hope to be in Alicante myself at the end of May to speak at a conference.	1.3378509863818555
I hope that this building will then be occupied.	1.0604399269651767
I would like to point out to the Commissioner that it is not an electoral question.	1.2791614106480456
As members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons.	1.2633012747512555
A year later, it is still not functioning, which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening.	1.3458861832470523
We should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified.	1.079726193273878
I would like to reiterate that the Commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of Member State actions.	1.3369075864014812
It is, however, interested in official statements and actions.	1.0116963015554765
We do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in French un procès d'intention.	1.0420230739944958
We are concerned with public official actions and events, rather than any possible underlying motivation.	1.1618549459165173
This is why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question.	1.178728079094427
Once again, the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned. It only appreciates that a building for this Office is opened and occupied as soon as possible.	1.0889706834728792
Also, the Commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or virtual.	1.1212074288694533
As far as I am concerned, all expenditure is real.	1.0969173609328176
And any remaining skeletons, I intend to leave them in the cupboard.	1.0932863908393302
Question No 54 by (H-0117/00):	0.7393607605097905
Subject: Alcohol monopoly and the internal market What action does the Commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the State alcohol monopoly apparently being planned by Sweden, and the associated import restrictions, and to ensure that the rules of the single market are applied?	1.4159847967684993
I would like to answer these two questions as follows.	1.1980239418193601
When Sweden joined the European Union, it was allowed to retain quantitative restrictions on alcoholic beverages which travellers can bring into the country from other Member States.	1.178341957356539
This derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on 30 June of this year.	0.9214755624584049
Sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years, as this would be necessary to protect public health.	1.1976300379031866
My position on this is clear.	0.9214826129213236
Sweden has now had sufficient time - since its accession to the Union - to adapt its policies to a situation where such import restrictions do not exist.	1.2764163771849337
I cannot see a reason, therefore, why a further extension for this measure should be proposed.	1.2023440464590789
European citizens have the right to buy goods for their own use, including taxes, in any Member Sate and to take them to another Member Sate without having to subject these goods to controls and without possibly having to pay another set of taxes on them.	1.3023104922779274
That is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time.	1.263106040594754
We want to guarantee that Swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market, just like other citizens of the European Union.	1.031985177113188
This certainly does not mean that I do not share the concern in Sweden surrounding the possible health problems which can be caused by alcohol abuse.	0.9846735983125333
A recent study, carried out by Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund, however, has shown that abolishing the restrictions would not lead to a higher alcohol consumption in Sweden.	1.1562406576856972
I have already had a chance to discuss my position with Mr Ringholm, the Swedish Finance Minister on two occasions.	1.3375476979289034
I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week.	0.8429538952688279
It is now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measures.	1.372719498979343
Thank you for your reply.	0.5091778424529624
I should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the Commission. Instead of 2004, it should, of course, be 1 July 2000.	1.320143487011418
I have some sympathy with the Commission's standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally.	1.2939178210347932
Such a rule is only normal.	0.6410178103223488
Nevertheless, I should like to ask two questions: Are you thinking of embarking upon continued discussions with the Swedish Government about extending the derogations, for example for as long as Denmark and Finland have derogations?	1.259667299086018
My second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol.	0.8458959980476838
This may, of course, be seen as an issue concerning the internal market, but also as a public health matter for the whole EU.	1.4048281701597662
What are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the Commission's work?	1.3054279241438826
A Europe-wide policy on alcohol is not just an issue concerning the internal market. It also has important implications for public health.	1.342760999190845
If we had considered these aspects in their overall context, then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with Sweden.	1.2128410587635783
May I thank Mr Andersson for the supplement to his first question and may I answer that question as follows?	1.0482002368685
Firstly, Finland and Denmark are subject to exemptions to the basic rule of the free movement of goods until 2003.	1.1114864897661287
These countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 2003.	1.097784545523272
However, in the case of Sweden, the situation is different.	1.4664185547143134
In 1995, a five-year derogation period was decided upon, which is now lapsing.	1.227064568248757
I have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the Commission would need to extend this period.	1.3633300362328555
Secondly, the Swedish Government is being consulted all the way.	1.367156861727845
I can inform Mr Andersson that I will leave for Stockholm on Monday, 6 March, in order to talk to Minister Ringholm, to members of the Swedish parliament, and, if necessary, also to the Prime Minister or other ministers, in order to continue discussions on this matter. I am fully aware that emotions are running high in the political arena in Sweden regarding this issue.	1.41343387446326
Thirdly, I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important.	1.554502542956278
I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated, namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions, the consumption of alcohol will remain the same.	1.1696764332306393
The question is then, of course, where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers?	1.31664074384827
The answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves, and as Mr Andersson knows, this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity.	1.4266866482106892
Well now, Mr Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol.	1.3015653209724865
But in that case, not only Sweden, but all EU countries, should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol.	1.5494494501946154
We can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the United States.	0.996865771499327
Mr Andersson will be familiar with what was termed then 'prohibition' .	0.8844423269444462
He will also be aware of the effects the ban had on Mafia activity within the United States, where, eventually, prohibition was withdrawn.	1.2131659607426641
All this means that we need to protect health, of course, but not by banning alcohol, because that does not work.	1.4180894558365602
Mr President, the question at issue is the income from the Swedish alcohol monopoly and when the Swedish Government says that it must cover health costs, then this is proof of a distortion of competition because other countries must cover their health costs themselves, with no alcohol monopoly at their disposal.	1.2501282982263888
My question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate intake of good quality alcohol such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the Swedish budget.	1.027208206687845
I gather that Mr Posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter.	0.9673905551474363
I also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol products in Sweden goes back to the year 1638 and that since then, the sale of alcohol products has accounted for a significant portion of the state' s tax revenue.	1.2261390849962623
As is known, this has led to a state monopoly in Sweden which, in itself, is at odds with Union legislation.	1.2872305330324818
As to the healing effect of alcohol - to which, I believe, Mr Posselt also made reference - I could not agree more with him: I think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant, and perhaps Mr Posselt, Mr Andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this Parliament one of these days to share an aquavit.	1.5430830914193436
Mr President, I listened with interest to the Commissioner's reply about the need to apply the laws of the single market.	1.3476684123331342
I wonder whether he can say whether he considers his reply to be compatible with the failure by the Commission to take the French Government to the European Court of Justice on the application of France's Loi et Vin, which effectively prevents single market rules applying to the sale of alcohol products in France?	1.2706205567137878
Can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice?	1.400370581794704
I should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable Member, since this matter is now under active consideration by the Commission.	1.2646995518591249
The Commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice.	1.4321289795777534
My reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now, but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks.	1.3971823477095606
I ask for the Member's understanding for this small delay in the Commission's decision.	1.3882276266201128
Commissioner, do you have any reason, on public health grounds, for a difference in the taxation rates on, for example, Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague's Bavarian beer?	1.3614513523909724
Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe?	0.8712012368512512
The matter of excise taxes, to which the honourable Member is referring, is the prerogative of the Member State concerned.	1.4283485722853073
The Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products.	1.0806479246950005
Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States.	1.1901920594258657
It will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs, which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States.	1.32288531937786
For example - I believe the honourable Member referred to this - no excise taxes are applied on wine in France, whereas they are applied in the United Kingdom.	1.2537780815146513
That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom.	0.8962264766567433
The question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax.	0.9326753837038994
The Commission has no means of influence here.	1.2117874898450853
In the case of Sweden, the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol.	1.0795375262483502
Although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that by itself increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol.	1.250013240771924
There is ,of course, elasticity of demand, in this case a price elasticity of demand.	1.222497345020622
I am not sure exactly what it is, but it is not zero, therefore it must have some effect.	1.4634367709990375
My question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis, but I would like to press the point further.	1.2634020631101444
Granted, as you say, that excise duties lie within the prerogative of Member States, nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the Community versus others might still conflict with the single market principle.	1.3507240042640432
For example, if we take what Mr Purvis and I would be thinking of, the malt whisky producing parts of the Highlands - a very peripheral part of Europe, very hard-pressed, a whole farming community as well as a distilling community dependent upon it - a general practice of taxing the alcohol in Scotch whisky, Dutch gin or Danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine, seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the Member States.	1.2839284304659682
May I assure Mr MacCormick and other Members of this Parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between Member States is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market.	1.2650658448110055
We need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products.	0.7767507035508535
If one looks at petrol, for example, one sees that excise taxes in Germany are different from those of Holland, and consequently Dutch motorists cross the border and fill up their tanks in Germany.	1.1467243452433975
That is indeed distortion of the internal market.	0.6901072186865063
If I had my way, I would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxes across Europe.	1.24104817513951
As a result, smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than another.	0.9007915744282033
But I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way.	1.2002704624164673
This is an area of unanimity, as Mr MacCormick knows, and unless all Member States agree on the equalisation of excise taxes, it will not happen.	1.499355177357935
Once again, towards the end of this year, the Commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes, and I am obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report.	1.3108849673465741
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.47513528222732565
Today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of Alsace wine, although we do not know how much tax is put on it, but I suppose it is a lot.	1.5752361496508522
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 55 to 114 will be replied to in writing.	0.8541384455999856
That concludes Questions to the Commission.	0.4490878857968008
(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	0.47342613617941054
Community policy in the field of water (continuation)	0.8466848252387554
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy.	1.1015936476609745
Mr President, the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease.	1.3953102891743998
To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East.	1.0475487870729039
In fact, a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania, threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia.	1.0259674383824042
I understand that Mrs Wallström, whose presence here tonight I appreciate, is going to visit the area.	1.3156610848328887
I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin.	1.5217726706682795
The development of this directive has been difficult and complex, involving diverse interests and divided opinions.	1.1781738574386913
I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature, Mrs Lienemann, has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions, and has succeeded to a large extent.	1.4178309402749931
However, it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations.	1.316118347274518
I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain.	0.9806037981823056
The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity, century after century, year after year, day after day, and is still doing so today.	1.211738829310546
Therefore, it seems essential to us that the directive complies, in practice, with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions.	1.5418229877277232
In accordance with this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 (Recital 21), 13 and 49 (Article 11(d)), since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States, that is, the regulation of water resources.	1.4175979176385878
It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions, given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests.	1.3466418447758792
We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010.	1.0557655108977864
We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which, at the same time, safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development.	0.9142825695487976
I would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero, or close to zero, degree of pollution.	1.2046684211291772
In no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution.	0.8409571277225113
We will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions.	1.1960659375567297
I hope that, once again, this House will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, seeking a suitable balance between the environmental objectives and economic and social considerations, the three essential elements in achieving the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much.	1.3052156112125812
Mr President, Commissioner, this is a very important directive.	1.2691110805060088
Its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems.	1.1429329449335086
The public must have a right to clean water.	1.0100941131736332
It is important not only for the environment but also for public health.	1.4105084685617162
I am not speaking so much for myself, as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home.	1.3732735116135848
We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality.	1.1365161702009374
Action must get under way immediately.	0.6340732425573746
We cannot afford to waste time.	0.6128966406847592
It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one.	1.172396351212678
In my opinion, the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then.	1.131449516618679
It is a question of doing what is technically possible; obviously it is not possible to do anymore, but we must be sufficiently ambitious.	1.431319450691737
I would like to comment on one issue, which was spoken about earlier.	1.3981430404376027
I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water.	0.941354447013397
This is not merely a problem for Spain; it is one for the Nordic countries, and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters, when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive.	1.516756081378516
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, congratulations, Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work.	1.735063450593443
Water and air surround us everywhere.	0.6561732885448214
We share them with everyone on this earth.	0.8260858842224983
Water is a prerequisite for human life.	0.8271060919407981
And there are more and more of us in the world.	1.1207864211053926
Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal.	0.7798210445957883
Nothing could be further from the truth!	0.7002196585413547
It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so, too, the conditions for life.	1.237984096143641
It is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources.	1.0468065041894112
I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order.	1.238952141766281
Mr President, we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann, the targets it sets and the directive under discussion.	1.4510051265303516
However, we should look a little more closely at some points.	1.4192657176446104
For example, a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes, which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments, and which, of course, are a great risk to ground waters, water tables and surface waters.	1.426841969801466
I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place, the specifications common to us all must be very stringent.	1.1401818570898306
But the key issue is, in my opinion, planning how to restore water tables, the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes, which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind.	1.2280127782500638
I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding, because, at the end of the day, that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy.	1.1860122328083826
Mr President, here we have what is basically a good measure.	1.4676596097224957
It sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management.	0.9409959642150657
Its aim of good-quality water for drinking, for wildlife, the environment and economic purposes is right.	1.3355811028847433
The prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood.	1.0804740597699625
We have three outstanding problems.	0.6904958258526993
The first is the transfer of water between basin areas.	1.047915782575093
That is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom.	1.3320835024556839
Amendments Nos 4. 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed, be that arid areas or urban areas.	1.2925501892690536
Secondly, we have to have realistic targets, but targets nevertheless.	1.5049976879828617
Looking at Amendment No 7, for example, which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances, you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic.	1.2513531815305319
Also, some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English, that is quite a meaningless term.	1.4016700560557183
We need to look very carefully at those.	1.1387654168990151
The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better.	0.7904944217570986
Thirdly, I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky.	1.312015610434387
Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky, which is the best - requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream.	1.2652250623040693
Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk.	0.8326497886934332
We must make sure that Amendments Nos 49 and 87 leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in "high quality", which means it must use good, Scottish peat water.	1.0363658051082327
That is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole.	1.269832276570869
Mr President, first of all, we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water, but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against Yugoslavia, aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded, have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too, making them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous.	1.2421738999773901
Turning to the report, we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata, or even in the annihilation of small and medium-scale farmers because of the prohibitive cost of water for irrigation.	1.2908420122805968
We also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country, and especially on the islands, funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water, by increasing not its cost but its quantity. This should mainly be carried out by collecting the rainwater that now goes to waste, running off into the sea and eroding the soil, with all the problems that creates.	1.2325716235113595
In that spirit, we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos.	1.276219317795857
River waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought.	1.064623847610473
Finally, as regards the Council' s allegation, which the Commission echoes, that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein, this is chicanery.	1.4500565988779153
Its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action, which during the directive' s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business.	1.0676747021691453
Mr President, first and foremost, I want to say that protection of the aquatic environment, both surface water and groundwater, is probably one of our most important duties of all.	1.338092687691208
That is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is, to a large degree, about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future.	1.5071981072572245
We are all entitled to clean drinking water.	0.8242327614056729
I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann' s work on this matter.	1.1638236578301566
It has been a huge task, and I should like to express my support for all of Mrs Lienemann' s amendments. These are all improvements to the common position.	1.4428741725891947
Moreover, I shall only highlight the most important ones.	1.659192583702235
First and foremost, I think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years.	1.2452612775430356
I also think it is important that we should put pressure on the Member States to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position.	1.2029351485418027
And, finally, I want to say that I think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we, as consumers, are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and, at the same time, obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which, I believe, there is broad agreement.	1.3630395716479486
In this regard, too, I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate.	1.0253099224184337
Finally, I want to say that I attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges, emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but, at the same time, be set a target, namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero.	1.3119565890378388
If this cannot be adopted as the objective, then I am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020.	1.2445374282606152
I think that Mrs Lienemann' s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the Council.	1.3321585470426243
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in drafting this important directive.	1.1050059308892712
The second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in Romania must feature in today' s discussions and also more generally when we ponder the environmental dimension of Union enlargement.	1.2623383898308884
First of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act.	1.3526311676501679
The cyanide and heavy metals in the rivers are gruesome examples of how environmental negligence may ruin the waterways for decades to come.	0.8324494727672341
The event proves that in some countries applying for EU membership the environmental norms and environmental thinking are still light years behind the EU.	0.9793291830853699
The Union ought to reassess how aid for environmental projects can be allocated in a better way in support of a sustainable policy on water.	1.0901441744650335
With regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean, natural groundwater.	1.1151128259374554
In Finland surface waters are very clean.	0.6739552482404003
The production of so-called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of filtering a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves.	0.9478335933115513
The process does not require a chemical sewage plant.	0.817469239655858
The directive must not be allowed to endanger this work.	0.8130081816271169
Deviating from the Council' s common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water.	0.9570814056221979
This would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed.	0.9884297993413022
The ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by Union acts.	1.0153672027285643
The work should, of course, be regulated and subject to license in the future too, but the same rules cannot apply to, for example, Finland and Greece, which suffers from drought.	1.2851429708662108
Mr President, Commissioner, water is a precious natural asset, a vital necessity, and it is our duty to protect it.	1.305839412169867
I think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the European Union, which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources, and I congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view.	1.3964300626918176
I must say, however, that, there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water, and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way.	1.4119221742626178
There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water, and that should be taken into account by this directive.	1.312085583935212
In recent years, climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain.	0.9114710668658624
We agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled, whose aim is to improve it.	1.3858640828142776
However, we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water, granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers.	1.3770881250879636
In addition, amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage.	1.2559172670020444
The issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought, I think, to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it.	1.518268852076983
As for the time scale demanded for the directive' s implementation, it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive' s implementation will take time and considerable resources.	1.3483756506059081
In spite of these remarks however, I believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resources can be maintained.	1.4304418399106786
Mr President, Commissioner, the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans, comprehensive information and hearing rights, and close cooperation between the Member States, to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants.	1.2620396242728462
And considering how long this Chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind, I am pleased to be present here today, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us.	1.1938238907330123
However, it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted.	1.4373498105546219
I would still like to highlight this point though: this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for diverting water from a Member State' s territory against its will.	1.1930624297142818
And by way of reaffirming this once again, I have introduced an amendment - gratifyingly with the support of a large number of Members - and I would be very pleased if Parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow.	1.2788953033483939
It is all about making it clear that water - and this is not the first time this has been mentioned today - is no ordinary commodity but a resource which belongs to the individual EU Member States and which must be protected and treated with the respect due to it.	1.3456433946963318
I am aware, and the previous speaker highlighted this, that there are States in the European Union that have problems with water.	1.6387095838557897
I believe that every one of us, in every country, could improve the way in which we manage our water and could make use of it in a cleaner way.	1.5678497297650782
This applies to every country.	0.7521213733329438
But only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources, when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries, only then, in my view, should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage.	1.245099121681696
Mr President, Commissioner, we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading.	1.3836107885576578
However, I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality, it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings.	1.5263002992915768
Firstly, I believe that this directive is excessively tough, simplistic and reductionist.	1.2373930581190196
In many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the Commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done, although I know that this is not pleasant.	1.4431038514230126
It is not a question of having much tougher regulations, because in many cases the problems concern management. It is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative, the complications of which we are all well aware of.	1.3744221859090409
This is a reductionist directive. We cannot lump countries with navigable rivers together with countries which lack water, where great cracks open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperatures of 55ºC or 60ºC in the sun.	1.2769505631889906
I say this because the ball does not need to be in our court. This issue is in the hands of the governments and the Commission.	1.483203462252744
In the same way, this damage and these tragedies which are happening, as in Romania, are not the problem of the legislative, but of the executive and of the governments.	1.6246449334252326
Furthermore, it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas, climatic diversity, desert areas and arid areas.	1.1209195458789227
That is how the common position has been worded.	1.071005910099951
The same can be said with regard to transfers.	0.7884986189892327
Transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth, of solidarity between peoples and territories, because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less.	1.281983835859974
Lastly, I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact.	1.4163666205726875
It is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but, on environmental questions, we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people, how many farmers, could be ruined by having to pay the costs.	1.4715079112488436
Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read, and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice, rather than just laying down doctrine.	1.2731769208193062
Mr President, through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union.	1.3002376836224245
It is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface, ground, transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and, in our case in Ireland, cross-border level.	1.43264691338998
Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments.	1.489314171447306
A 25-year roll-out for legislation, for example, is hardly acceptable.	1.1571966083573417
We have no difficulty with the "polluter pays" principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial, commercial and agricultural level.	1.0913794949451117
However, I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge, a quota per household for drinking, cooking and sanitation.	1.2732827855592772
We must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly.	0.8682728019122392
The introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977.	1.078943031027102
Meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts, to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements.	1.297001374782529
The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU.	1.1812625808998742
Water is a scarce and precious natural resource.	0.7910981527028338
Ideally, I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges.	1.3635968172411213
That would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges, with each Member States drawing up its own scheme, so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected.	1.4053645029782036
If Amendment No 45 does not fall, I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services.	1.2625194406067037
All legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance.	1.0083651753175225
I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world.	1.1707598438667346
Mr President, Commissioner, at this point in the debate I am going to insist on certain aspects which, from an agronomic point of view, and since I come from a southern country, I consider to be absolutely essential to this directive.	1.529284011518082
These include, for example, costs and transfers.	0.8531088767268272
With regard to costs, I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about.	1.14501485963728
Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water?	0.6714558475866444
Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks?	0.9697336730894477
Are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services?	0.8301830140254531
Or are we talking about large-scale hydraulic works and reservoirs?	0.8192815491255995
All these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector.	0.9001675468895443
Transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas.	0.7559993113629746
Is the Commissioner aware that our country has one of the oldest systems of transfers in Europe?	0.9469195918319162
They already existed in ancient times: they had them in Roman times, although on a smaller scale.	1.0901752939244562
One of the most significant transfers - the Tajo-Segura transfer - which has been in use for many years, almost 30 years, has an allowance of 658 hm3 per year.	1.3876829349001112
The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200.	0.8894849553816101
We cannot be accused of bad management.	0.7941592976419533
Is the Commissioner aware that, of this 263 hm3, we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the Levante, 30 for water supplies in the area of the Júcar, 7 for supplies in the southern area of the Júcar and the rest in the Segura, equally divided between supplies and irrigation?	1.2926874445135534
We are not doing a bad job of management.	1.2067195547228753
We cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it.	1.0800450310889507
I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies, because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive.	1.39254525168515
Take good note: in this diverse Europe, which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation, we have to find diverse solutions, not single solutions.	1.546346890183722
I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council and this House so that, when voting, they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required.	1.5382346518543522
Commissioner, Andalusia is not Lapland.	1.0396564074786279
. (SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, of course, to begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she has put into the present framework water directive.	1.1182391489597054
Water is one of our most important natural resources, as many speakers have already said.	1.2296180768039413
An ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe.	1.2196423751344312
Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office.	1.2839339285999571
I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament.	0.8603135688927965
Many of them are based upon the very constructive, informal discussions which have taken place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading.	1.4538436892630127
Most of Parliament' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious.	1.035148327271751
The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle.	0.8554367740430593
Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary.	1.1707171376647982
With a view to these forthcoming negotiations, I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position.	1.4056906644693894
Firstly, I should like to mention some of my most important arguments.	1.454179275235386
We now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention.	1.0896625405995015
Rather than make these objectives legally binding, we must consider their political nature.	1.1742260348944193
This is also reflected in many of Parliament' s amendments.	1.2168489004446066
Where water charges are concerned, the present directive will constitute Europe' s water policy for the next three decades.	1.148139046580761
It is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost-effective way.	1.2004877384553432
It sounds good, saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge.	0.9863649112582427
But water is not free of charge, any more than houses or food are free of charge.	1.0564828727709714
It is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource.	1.205377649210364
I also want to add that, when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities, I support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules. I also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances.	1.3388547086229812
In the course of the debate, many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed.	1.2520388749832874
I just want to emphasise this further.	1.170046183452427
It is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them.	0.9740656284676169
This is also expressed in Recital 14.	1.105007581580171
Allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that, in common with my Scottish colleague, he need have no pangs of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again.	1.2332780498013558
We have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production.	1.3388281309694225
Allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail.	1.1132902228196921
Limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives.	0.9054393264516308
I am glad to see that Parliament' s amendments have focused upon this.	0.9972169998807405
The Commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the OSPAR Convention into the text.	1.0769962872914915
We must, however, keep to their precise scope and content.	1.0970032626100599
As I said, their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character.	1.0599030641726284
It would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable.	1.0457918427224593
It must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables.	1.114076693275463
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 .	0.8557084452292112
The Commission cannot, on the other hand, approve Amendment No 19, in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR.	1.2391541385050484
The Commission' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances, and so no definition is needed.	1.2644053219468967
Even if I too agree with the contents of Amendments Nos 79 and 106, these go beyond the commitments under OSPAR, and I cannot therefore approve these Amendments.	1.3930023403196015
The Commission can also, in principle, approve Amendment No 60, according to which a timetable is required for implementing the Commission' s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances.	1.206471058861199
Amendment No 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed.	0.869616075610879
This would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot, therefore, be approved.	1.0226162051404577
The desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved.	0.9248671429228226
Lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances.	1.0971453425456816
I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way alter existing Community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector.	1.1430860103897975
The Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive.	1.099393051480933
I appreciate the fact that Parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services.	1.1412408275476225
I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way.	1.1266203322247328
I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs.	1.064625044767333
I can therefore partly, and in principle, approve Amendments Nos 43-46, together with Amendment No 85.	1.2929413559021634
I believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector.	1.2926551885382223
This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured.	0.714602364855253
I therefore support the overall thrust of Amendment No 105, which is in line with the Commission' s original proposal.	1.2728032087263121
I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources.	0.9811409142550915
We are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals.	1.389566096264105
This must not, however, be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution.	1.121773482646355
We intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question.	1.1155425425453962
I agree with Parliament that the common position' s sixteen-year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced.	1.0799812411566627
The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years.	0.9845819688963834
Amendment No 28, cancelling the third extension period, is an important step in the right direction.	1.0633197256693772
This proposal can therefore be approved.	0.5417487704179466
A period of ten years, as proposed in Amendments Nos 24 and 26, among others, is, on the other hand, too short.	1.3169662550209926
I believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided.	1.2808560245384666
The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water.	0.9492412999204739
This applies to Amendments Nos 6, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 78, 80, 102 and 104.	0.680685041190741
These Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found.	1.0708032981672502
To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29, to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension, would be going too far, and these cannot be approved.	1.4258097257734055
Another important area is protection of the groundwater.	0.9677521849089926
We need both a starting point and a final goal if we are to reverse the upward trend in pollution.	1.0708841937288636
We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring.	1.0931106664954213
The most important parts of Parliament' s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle.	1.0338772645485261
The new definition in Amendment No 72 is, however, too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose.	1.301051568378146
I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution.	0.8483331514523014
Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater.	0.8698312900135023
The proposal cannot therefore be approved.	0.48837598795030235
The Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality.	1.0134342091314108
Instead, we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with Article 11 to promote activities in this area.	1.3408408507479714
The good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled.	1.005226497338829
This part of Amendment No 41 cannot, therefore, be approved.	0.9033923420083348
The Commission appreciates Parliament' s efforts to guarantee that the so-called combined approach is given a central role.	1.1180186747309293
This approach and its scope, which the Commission can in principle approve, are defined by Amendments Nos 22 and 47.	1.4364271648835207
In order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality, we wish, however, to reformulate Amendment No 47 and to add a de minimis provision.	1.4032533582512292
The transfer of water is already covered by controls, but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer.	1.1903781969940117
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can, therefore, be approved.	0.744257806664875
It is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted.	1.1588847665372508
The proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned.	0.995064583845874
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 cannot, therefore, be approved.	0.7183033655815952
The Commission approves Amendment No 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal.	0.8906102434117087
To summarise, the Commission is able to approve 72 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle.	0.9520939947172219
The following amendments cannot be approved: 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 71, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 90, 91, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 103, 106 and 107.	0.6706322963359534
Finally, I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views.	1.4462164143757943
Important progress has been made, and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions.	1.2125656455090381
A number of obstacles remain, but I am convinced that, as the legislative work progresses, we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of.	1.4696246231125627
Parliament' s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious, European water policy for the next three decades.	1.1900188259107878
I would like to hear the Commissioner's view on Amendment No 45.	1.2288429546185318
I may have missed it in the list she gave out.	1.008070858500655
. I accept that.	1.1285909128681828
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.	0.9168360875475176
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m.	0.4486518941132708
Financial instrument for the environment (LIFE)	0.6090345256997165
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0014/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Regulation on a financial instrument for the environment (LIFE) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	0.9576024570721404
rapporteur.	-0.0
(FR) Mr President, we have already had the opportunity, at the first reading, to examine this report and I was given to believe in committee that there was a broad consensus within this House.	1.4599679495676219
LIFE is the only budget line for direct assistance for the environment in the Community budget, and one cannot help but note that it does not live up to our ambitions since the amounts allocated to it have been stagnating for years. Despite the enlargement which has already taken place, when we renewed the first LIFE programme to move on to the second, despite enlargement, the level of appropriations remained the same.	1.4360856214778754
And then we see that, increasingly, the regions, the various operators, businesses, associations, are submitting LIFE projects, both for LIFE-NATURE and LIFE-ENVIRONMENT, projects that are of excellent quality, which following technical assessment by all the competent committees are unanimously found to be worthy of European Union support, but we still cannot fund them, for lack of budget appropriations.	1.4717441601206656
It must also be mentioned that this budget experiences a rate of consumption of appropriations which is quite exceptional within the Community budget.	1.0532067900981037
Patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement.	1.0303574993523876
I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular.	0.9379885988604392
We are well aware that, in the European Union, a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation. With LIFE-NATURE we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility, the validity of the objectives of these directives, and their capacity to be implemented.	1.4726436340550015
And, for want of appropriations, we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop.	1.3391799531703832
And so the debates taking place today focus on two major issues: firstly, comitology, an ongoing debate within this House, but Parliament wished to implement policies settled rather by management committees or advisory committees which give the Commission some flexibility and which do not give the Council too much scope to obstruct and have their intergovernmental philosophy prevail over the Community philosophy which we are here to stand up for within the European Parliament.	1.291759523165751
But we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the European Union' s financial programmes and instruments.	1.2647202726071445
I would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget.	1.4326513309794249
Let me point out that Parliament is asking for 850 million ecus in appropriations, not a vast sum in the Community budget, and that the current proposals are for 613 million ecus.	1.3432748838729767
I feel, at any rate, that for the ultimate application of LIFE, at least, there would be some way for the Union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment.	1.5390558421676235
Let me conclude with the matter of our institutions' way of working.	1.0911958574310856
This is the essence of how I understand the situation: we are being told that it is essential for us to reach a conclusion quickly, that, basically, the Members of Parliament should drop their claims, particularly claims on the budget, for if we do not soon, in line with the codecision procedure, get around to establishing the framework of the regulations for LIFE, then its implementation for the year 2000 is going to suffer a delay, and in the meantime the NGOs and the operators at grass roots level are waiting for our appropriations.	1.4773679099124433
I would, however, like to point out that the Council has plenty of time to formulate its ideas and that it is submitting its proposals to us only a few months before the fateful date.	1.3190811991039564
As for us, we our bound by the terms of the texts: a maximum of four months.	1.3493740042696265
We meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others, because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time.	1.3388121214404523
I think Parliament often protests about this method, not to point the finger at any specific party within the Council, and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs, since, the truth is, it is something of a tradition, which the Council has kept going for a long time.	1.5601292856761657
But I should like to stress the fact that, on this issue of the environment, the budget issue is a central one and Parliament cannot yield to the blackmail which requires it to be the only reasonable party in the deal.	1.525511183046028
I therefore hope, firstly, that our fellow Members will support us in the conciliation - but votes on this area are always very much in agreement - but also that the Council and the Commission will manage to listen to us and that we shall each take a step towards the other.	1.5882791280711002
Mr President, it is true that we are in open disagreement on some of the choices made by the Council and the Commission, and I will refer to this later on.	1.4511544634604967
It is equally true, however, that we should begin by saying that this regulation is better than those covering LIFE I and LIFE II.	1.3072864619451678
It is better firstly because the framework proposal made LIFE I more rigorous, more transparent and more rational.	1.156245855661965
Secondly, it is better because the common position includes some fundamental recommendations, which were advocated by the European Parliament at first reading. Specifically, these are: to promote employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting candidate projects, and to reduce the environmental impact of products at every stage from production to recycling and elimination.	1.5505753997937786
This is one of the aims that LIFE-Environment must achieve. Thirdly, the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of LIFE-Environment' s priorities is an extremely positive step.	1.3937099692676203
In spite of all its virtues though, LIFE III' s regulation fails in what is obviously the most important aspect of determining a financial instrument' s impact, which is its budget.	1.365776739982057
By persisting with their proposal of EUR 613 million as a reference amount for 2000 - 2004, and by refusing to accept the European Parliament' s proposal of EUR 850 million, the Commission and the Council are taking a decision which we do not feel is based on the same criteria of rationality and justice that they introduced, and rightly so, for other measures in LIFE III.	1.397724570125873
We want the Commission and the Council to know that we will not give up trying to provide LIFE with the budget it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that we are seeking to achieve with this kind of instrument.	1.4461092879333728
We have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice.	0.8208179895042472
Firstly, LIFE is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the European Union.	1.0883403584349038
There is no other such policy.	1.1239439569777292
Secondly, LIFE is an instrument that has already produced good results, and has enabled innovative methods and techniques to be developed and has an excellent rate of implementation.	1.477776127570848
Thirdly, the LIFE budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand.	1.1226914855754557
Fourthly, as Parliament ascribes so much value to LIFE, it has allocated ever-greater appropriations to this project in its annual budget.	1.3612271564135836
This means that approving the proposal put forward by the Council and by the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend.	1.4863731067045094
Our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue, however.	1.049578873487949
Climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the European public and which have deserved considerable attention from this House.	1.2062939593935764
We therefore feel it is crucial that as Amendments Nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which LIFE-Environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water, as well as for reducing greenhouse gases, they should be adopted.	1.1456844477665564
Lastly, I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her report and to take the opportunity to say to her that we will be voting in favour of her amendments on comitology even though, as was made clear in the Committee on the Environment, we would prefer LIFE to have been monitored by an advisory committee, we do want to contribute to allowing the solution proposed by the Council to be accepted as quite frankly, it was worse.	1.4944474620721946
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE is the European Union' s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment.	1.1911868077088974
That explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions, ambitions for which, of course, there is a price.	1.0774932178729133
Obviously, the basic item for discussion with the Council will be the allocation for LIFE III.	1.5282305427752845
The common position stipulates a total appropriation of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004. This is not enough.	1.2772458524458696
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million.	0.8066645567954162
We therefore support Mrs Lienemann' s amendment which observes that the allocation for LIFE was not increased when the Union was last enlarged, without even mentioning the next batch of new arrivals.	1.1137799761626783
The amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure.	1.018971466823542
Quite the opposite, it is still fairly modest in relation to the requirements to be funded.	1.4236528170413218
A drop in the ocean, I might say, in comparison with Europe' s structural policies.	1.3635923994008654
The environment is still the poor relation in the European budget, even though it is primarily an investment.	1.546455990158888
An investment in natural resources, of course, but also in employment, since it has been demonstrated that an active environmental policy generated new jobs, as shown particularly by the great success of LIFE, a success with NGOs, businesses, local authorities and third countries.	1.326792898283635
More than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998.	0.9531349736022723
A success which Parliament wishes and intends to see perpetuated, and this is why we also support amendment 14 outlining the fourth phase of the LIFE project.	1.1891648612305508
In matters of the environment, investment and ambition come in a variety of forms, and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term.	1.0651073369733133
This is the price of the future of generations to come.	1.4948079245799637
Mr President, Commissioner, I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that, as far as the Council is concerned, the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE.	1.4707926679842263
I shall therefore reiterate that, as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly, LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union' s policy on the environment.	1.3964319687236875
This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States.	1.2757501410131802
This financial instrument is, furthermore, deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisations.	1.0235610868467755
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of LIFE.	1.1617410573386564
Through the associations, then, LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly, and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community.	1.3711161139367318
Several million NGO members - millions, I say - recognise in LIFE the Union' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage.	1.28369961875305
LIFE is, moreover, the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe into which the Member States have put a lot, pursuant to Community directives on the habitats of rare and endangered fauna and flora and on migratory birds, and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our States.	1.249428019151118
I should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own States bear the responsibility for obstructing European nature conservation policies.	1.1885216774401544
This is a pity because everyone within this Chamber knows that LIFE is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by Member States, a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds.	1.2965149640577598
Let us not forget that, to date, LIFE amounts to only EUR 100 million per annum, i.e. scarcely 0.1% of the budget of the European Union.	1.154395001022039
For the record, the budget for agriculture, which has a real impact on the environment, amounts, as we all know, to EUR 37 billion.	1.4864497739374984
Against this background, my group thinks it essential to increase the allocation to LIFE and unreservedly supports Mrs Lienemann' s proposal to increase the budget to EUR 850 million, since we know, and I think it bears saying, how high the expectations of our fellow citizens on environmental matters are and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the Council' s compromise regarding the budget for LIFE is, especially as the LIFE programmes show exceptional implementation rates and have demonstrated the extent to which they made it possible to bring about new environmental practice.	1.326314671892661
The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those.	0.7672283635107903
Mr President, the European Union environmental programme, to which a considerable amount (EUR 613 million) has been allocated, gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds.	1.4240767164668533
A financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective, and this is not the case for the following reasons: poorly defined selection criteria, dubious uncoordinated operations, assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy.	1.0970858436067652
We are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows.	1.1594270304929928
Firstly, to reserve the acquisitions made thanks to LIFE funds exclusively to public bodies, subsequently, following invitation to tender, to entrust the management of these sites to authorised nature conservation associations.	1.262433654700576
It is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions, since private law associations may disappear or resell acquisitions.	1.163512218260218
It is shocking in philosophical terms and dubious in legal terms for 100% public money to be used to build up a heritage of private land ownership, even under cover of environmental protection.	1.1040937347772626
Secondly, to define the criteria for the eligibility and allocation of LIFE funds, in order to rule our any suspicions of clientelism or ostracism.	1.218141842807493
Thirdly, to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite.	1.3028917921819503
For example, the LIFE-Nature project in France, at Grand-Lieu Lake, planned without any coordination, led to a real ecological disaster, the de-silting operation which was carried out without regard for French law on the subject caused significant silting of the Acheneau, a water course located downstream, destroying spawning beds, filling wetlands, and who knows what else.	1.2202393014687896
The silt was in fact shifted 3 kilometres, at a cost of FF 6 million, the cure being worse than the disease, and a consequence that was foreseeable and actually predicted by the parties involved with the site.	1.3133689998789997
Result: a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself.	1.2078147273906958
This is the sort of thing that we want to avoid.	1.0854856760052607
Four, to include representatives of Parliament in the monitoring committee, at least one Member per political group.	1.459156112403585
What could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for?	1.1438648264221585
Fifthly, to publish an annual scientific, technical and financial assessment of LIFE operations carried out.	1.2308284222398824
Six, to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis.	1.2102295985569476
Seven, to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency: for example, in reforestation following storm damage, or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick, etc.	1.351125768154068
Here, Mrs Lienemann, Mr President, we are putting forward here a practical proposal, a common sense proposal, easy to implement, likely to limit local conflicts and to vindicate the proper use of public monies, before increasing the LIFE budget line by as much as 40%!	1.2768959770022104
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the report she has carried out, and also the Commission - why not? - because this report, this position, generally improves on the texts in force.	1.2563820790424918
Furthermore, it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent.	1.1400127263558857
I would also like to congratulate the services of the Commission, since the evaluation, control and monitoring of the LIFE programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects.	1.2407918320396971
However, I would like to insist on certain points.	1.032854583689669
Firstly, its continuity, which, in principle, I am not questioning.	1.6852991403692086
Secondly, the financial contributions.	1.5006853159394384
Sadly, only 7.2% of the projects requested receive funds.	1.4298157352866427
Of the EUR 1 919 million requested, only EUR 784 million have been granted.	1.054381580458913
Now the financial statement shows only EUR 613 million to cover more countries and competences.	0.8733742194930944
Parliament has proposed EUR 850 million, but the document repeats the initial proposal of EUR 613 million.	1.096808409192988
Commissioner, our environmental commitments are increasing in all areas, while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicated to the environment is decreasing.	1.4702010800735246
Is this not a contradiction?	0.9470431864922032
Let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves?	1.2779922231123735
Why do we all go on about the environment and are then not prepared to pay for it amongst all of us, but rather expect the usual people, the ones who live there all year, to pay for it and maintain it?	1.4284787938516068
Commissioner, we must be consistent.	1.5587706335046447
The cost of maintaining the environment, which we all enjoy, must be met by all of us, and the LIFE programme is the only financial instrument aimed exclusively at the environment and whose projects have generally been effective.	1.459215155611451
Mr President, LIFE has been the principal instrument available to the Community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy, both within the Community and in the surrounding third countries.	1.5261911946119022
On the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years, an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument.	1.3518871889663497
The funding of activities for the implementation, adaptation and development of Community policy in the environment sector and the incorporation of the environment in other policies, particularly ones that contribute towards sustainable development, are central elements of the regulation we are to vote upon.	1.3644514266692294
An important element of LIFE-Nature, which mainly concerns the realisation of the Natura 2000 network, is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities, so as to avoid the fragmentation of biotopes and to offer better protection of biodiversity.	1.183885796506263
In the second, LIFE-Environment strand, which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium-sized enterprises and local government agencies, the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed.	1.3174647269945696
As regards the financing package for the implementation of LIFE over the next five years, I wholeheartedly support the increase from EUR 613 million to EUR 850 million proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann.	1.2441620797924697
Unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection, there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years, and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies.	1.3240417108250013
Besides, we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the Union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries.	1.145089947303338
What has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the Danube and its tributary has been instructive.	1.07748161283008
Consequently, I consider that support for environmental action under the LIFE financial instrument will help to further Community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfilling the Community' s mission of achieving a high level of environmental protection and improvement.	1.2354757726346093
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment, ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening.	1.131450182447695
Two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic.	0.991833114757471
So I will simply appeal to the Commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue.	1.3489848649888094
For five years, I have been the representative of the Committee on the Environment in a regional organisation, which assuredly does not have Parliament' s broad perspective.	1.6023323340910884
The environment is in a parlous state.	1.1638737514118997
Like a number of previous speakers, I, too, wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects, which, in my view, should be incorporated into the pubic domain.	1.190085154922987
As regards funding, EUR 613 million is not enough. Even EUR 850 million is not enough.	0.9587275107714793
At the end of August 1999, I took part in a meeting of the Committee of the Environment in which it was said that EUR 2 million, or ITL 4 000 billion, should go towards eliminating or, at any rate, reducing smoking.	1.424348804485872
However, the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking.	1.245984078109292
EUR 850 million - assuming that such a figure is actually agreed - believe me, is not enough, in practical terms, to allow any type of project to be carried out.	1.3836869186391185
In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established.	1.1689434593907504
But creating parks with very limited financial resources, without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual.	1.0471453679311182
I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention.	1.3183585662644086
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the beginning of 1999, discussions have taken place between the institutions on the subject of the proposed regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment known as LIFE.	1.299458657307739
I would again thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have had on this matter.	1.0460087457992127
As a result of this, I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	1.0558304080228484
The Commission welcomes, above all, Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, which apply to the Committee procedures.	0.9933821690055828
In these cases, Parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the Commission had to the common position.	1.2631343914323312
The Commission can, in principle, also approve Amendment No 4 which ought, however, to be introduced into another place in the text.	1.504572568720782
With regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6, I want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water, together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect, are to a large degree covered by LIFE.	1.1631071873113503
The Commission nonetheless considers that, if this is stated separately, then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas.	1.4241617998054223
There is also a risk of overlap with other Community programmes such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technical Development and Demonstration.	1.1454320750614737
The present programme' s key measures - water quality, tomorrow' s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions.	1.1744874891750352
Where the question of the budget is concerned, I am pleased about the confidence shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	1.038474203366051
Amendment No 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position.	0.9029585644420338
I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential.	1.023785336964118
This instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget.	0.922248935989573
The amount quoted in Amendment No 12 does not, however, tally with the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000.	1.1457387813799964
Allow me also to add that, if the budget is increased, greater demands are obviously going to be made upon the Directorate-General for the Environment if an increased number of projects are going to be dealt with.	1.3900142333081205
Account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decision-making procedure.	1.2871444741950082
At this stage, the Commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position.	1.1970289565108212
With regard to Amendment No 3, which we did not approve at first reading, I want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives, conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid.	1.2846344599559711
It is therefore meaningless, and often impossible, directly to transfer projects from LIFE to other instruments.	1.3700924735341828
If other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project, more resources would, moreover, be required than are available in the present situation.	1.325468922214368
Now that the Commission has to consider carefully what resources are required for each activity, this is an example of the kind of activity we ought to avoid: one that is inessential but demanding in terms of resources.	1.2970811090292476
Nor can the Commission approve Amendment No 14, which is contrary to the Commission' s right of initiative.	1.3127197255336318
With regard to the discussion concerning the deadline, I want to say that the final date for beginning to implement LIFE - 31 March 2000, as set in the common position - must now be moved forward.	1.3607399880572413
The date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted.	1.0955813188063164
Finally, I want to repeat that I am convinced that LIFE will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the Community' s environmental policy.	1.3540858438498466
Parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument.	0.7068075624965496
I am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible, especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the Member States and in other countries, especially among the applicant States which are now being given the opportunity to participate in LIFE.	1.2751940236393426
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.	0.9168360875475176
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	0.28917441844220476
Modernising social protection	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000), by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)].	0.9133046290970745
Mr President, the issue of social security systems is an important one.	1.2353318014549755
This is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU.	1.2329009618992952
The basis is monetary cooperation, which has since been followed up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy.	1.2467615327732489
It is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems.	1.1182464974772972
These areas are mutually dependent upon one another.	0.6839231529513701
Economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment.	0.9100033001797745
It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision.	0.9639705342123379
But the reverse is also the case: a well-developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth.	1.1773642678673695
In other words, social security is a factor of production.	1.2026879958066852
Social security systems differ from one EU country to another.	0.7881141740536208
This is largely due to historical factors.	0.5972951019643755
We are now faced with a number of common challenges, however; demographic development, for example, which has to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the lower birth rate.	1.3578831292324716
The labour market is also changing.	0.7790587053057001
Women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers.	0.7902855266339684
Another challenge is presented by technical development.	0.7083134735969823
We must meet these challenges together.	0.6861582541239384
The Commission' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared, a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced.	1.2539777119890325
What is more, the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment.	1.30669779902666
This is good, but it is not enough.	0.9037613057083863
We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process.	0.7947591161792571
Clear guidelines and indicators are required. At the same time, the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans.	1.1153166166339232
We are creating a common model, but retaining the principle of subsidiarity.	1.1211304901089625
This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period.	1.1353136371641717
Parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high-level group, but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on.	1.4764605003218818
Like the work on employment, the Commission' s proposal is founded upon four pillars.	1.2459080510810496
These are: to make the systems employment-friendly; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term; to promote social integration; and to guarantee sustainable, high-quality health and medical care.	1.4385444479688312
All this is important.	0.805784492044906
In our report, we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the EU and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area.	1.483793451060444
Equality has no pillar of its own.	0.7994194492984764
There, it is mainstreaming which applies.	1.1723575756364422
All four pillars should reflect aspects of equality.	0.7141901561139181
This is something we have borne in mind.	1.2856642742274105
We are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect, for example, that there should be a transition to individualised social security systems; that parental leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life; and that the basic old-age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living.	1.1977850001621353
These proposals favour women especially.	0.5039196357254304
Parallel to this European strategy of social convergence, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required, together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees, accompanied by a concrete timetable.	1.1420816186670848
We expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme.	1.3654445270692503
Social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union, partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping.	1.1053549988800664
The Commission ought to consider devising a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement.	1.1170395902856296
We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee.	1.0769400186083429
We had a lot of amendments, but succeeded in agreeing upon a report.	1.1197386265179308
Now, the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen.	1.2783294514107892
This indicates that we have a broad consensus.	1.2881368398835304
A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading, and these I shall reject.	1.4360203314633442
I shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members, because I do not think that these add anything to the report.	1.4191622236408736
On the other hand, my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	0.8807389885421884
I think this proposal is a good one.	1.3374807637112949
Certainly, it resembles Amendment No 1, but Amendment No 14 is better.	1.3860989355329414
Finally, I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade.	1.4591045463276506
The EU is also a union for employment and social justice.	1.569260747619824
In creating a citizens' Europe, social policy has an important role to play.	1.0560391920219565
By means of this report, Parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of European society.	1.1707688138425605
We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy.	1.280578774694529
The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind.	1.1805289034207296
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion.	1.2756779392676336
In the capacity of coordinator of the European People' s Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which Mr Andersson put so much effort into.	1.1787986189164006
I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report.	1.2651219784601613
The goal of the Commission' s notification of June 1999, on which the Andersson report is based, is to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the EU in terms of social protection.	1.4249862035077248
Key sub-goals are: promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income; secondly, safeguarding old-age pensions and making these affordable; thirdly, promoting social integration and fourthly, guaranteeing affordable, first-rate health protection.	1.1788063170693477
Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals.	0.8718950038864363
I believe that congratulations are also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification, for these four points are, in fact, to a very large number of EU citizens extremely important - if not the most important points which merit further thought.	1.6299791839693187
The Commission' s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about European social convergence.	1.141788513949207
Macro-economic policy, employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together.	1.3391495340157462
The Commission has recognised this interrelatedness.	1.1343870230092348
It is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is, of course, underpinned by a sound macro-economic strategy and a sound employment strategy.	1.0995292943011028
These aspects are very much interconnected.	0.8306245293465148
It is, therefore, surprising that this topic has, to date, not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the Commission' s notification constitutes a break-through in a way.	1.4235316921173005
It brings me great joy to witness that the Council now seems to accept this break-through and also wants to bring it to the fore in Lisbon.	1.1482482663649625
We should, of course, not get overly excited about it.	1.053381029926354
It marks the beginning, rather than the end, of a process.	1.2934097994327447
Some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue.	1.0409674389555539
But it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion.	1.3810551207589534
The issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the European Union are quite different from one another.	1.314721090438024
The challenges are different.	0.6276108038296627
The levels of employment are different and this is why it is very important to set the ball rolling gently but to make steady progress nonetheless.	1.1920535519564441
In this way, we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges.	1.1421666778064998
The majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen.	1.2715587457577686
The funny thing about the Andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape; from this perspective it is not a pie-in-the-sky report.	1.1857203394625357
It is a report which tries to give direction.	1.160030557423727
There are, however, one or two aspects about which I have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific.	1.27005035842175
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this.	1.1006953382392917
But that does not take away from the fact that the report' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon.	1.3780329162483882
I believe that if it were to be adopted in Lisbon in this way, Lisbon will turn out to be a success.	1.2980138279119464
If it is not adopted, Lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past.	1.3513127136769378
As far as this is concerned, the report, albeit a component, may well be the key component of Lisbon, because it is really innovative, while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before.	1.4252106925169032
All in all, I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report.	1.5595767729704266
I hope that Europe, in terms of social protection, will make a step forward, taking into account subsidiarity, for without subsidiarity, this would not be possible.	1.5747284645981443
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like my fellow MEP, Bartho Pronk, please allow me to thank the Commission for this communication and, in particular, to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report.	1.4228563824084373
Commissioner, the fact that this report is no longer controversial within Parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance.	1.540515789526582
There have been times within this Parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward.	0.9356210601093312
It is also a timely discussion - as Mr Pronk said just a moment ago - at a time when preparations are in full swing for the Lisbon Summit, which intends to find out how we can put economic growth, employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe via the Information Society.	1.4624527759494277
Within my group, it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in Lisbon.	1.2902467706104122
My group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council gave the go-ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that, in fact, a group of high-ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the Council an initial report by June 2000.	1.2975460201279643
However, we, the Parliament and, in particular, the group of the Social Democrats, want Lisbon to go one step further now.	1.5187147603295001
It is of great importance that, in our fellow MEP' s report, this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence, based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy, that is to say it should encompass common goals, guidelines, national action plans and performance evaluations.	1.293709634397547
We believe that this course of action is ambitious, yet achievable.	1.2958187587830632
Needless to say, it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level.	1.190192575841043
The financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this, and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda, and why, in fact, scenarios such as Danny Peters' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground.	1.302361818499515
But this new course of action is very exciting.	0.9035665534431605
The employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary, for our social security systems are facing the same challenges, and in an EMU era, social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition.	1.4040697897342098
But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group: social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation.	1.301773156237779
They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation.	1.4377584684668614
I think that it also a good thing if, moreover, the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001.	1.288622077683264
I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group' s idea and we hope, Commissioner, that we can also count on your support.	1.286661565374856
Finally, we urge the European Parliament, both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process.	1.3899136186625247
The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support.	1.0859133416770208
Mr President, the four chief objectives which the EU countries' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows: that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable; that social integration should be promoted; and that sustainable, high-quality health care should be guaranteed.	1.3313068619661876
These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them. Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from.	1.1909561903248393
The Commission' s communication, which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November, is a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union.	1.3972208707967473
We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets, which is a problem for many Member States.	1.2007862310766213
If reforms are not got under way, we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security.	1.3136631758323642
It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda.	1.1779395687498577
In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression social convergence.	1.5763114361938566
As liberals, we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies.	1.3232648408882097
It is not, therefore, about harmonisation but about common objectives.	1.2210349727837682
It is, of course, a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy.	1.4103982264464607
We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and, in spite of there being many points of similarity, there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned. It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern.	1.3137176167971019
National policy is, of course, subject to a number of common parameters. That is the case with minimum social entitlements, which are established by treaty.	1.396168072140444
It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation.	1.4549266469617599
So coordination and cooperation are facts of life. But convergence should be about goals, not means.	1.3693951001756852
I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report.	1.105023478849555
I can support the report, but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste.	1.5255668569482883
I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems, if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient, or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries.	1.3731372272754971
I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly, and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold.	1.11231892624249
Dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended, but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same. There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions.	1.3095127582401682
Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security, I would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me.	1.2869524493401558
I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier.	0.9748965350208916
This seems to be a good thing and useful.	1.3673484466446135
I also feel positive about the essence of the communication, namely the strategic approach.	1.163286186857043
We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved.	1.0351537720456312
We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled. On the one hand, it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg, but we also think it is important, as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker, that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios, such as sole traders, etc.	1.3358908335355342
We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found.	0.9993310846841271
The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security, which, we hope, will be replaced by high-level convergence.	1.3007030383262606
I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union.	0.9078864989179053
It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments, in fact, the majority of them, appear to be downward adjustments, the remainder being improvements.	1.1494119761410027
The lion' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans: eleven restrictions and two improvements.	0.8336114219299819
In the case of unemployment benefits, we came across six restrictions and five improvements.	1.168535153073505
The reasons for adjustments are, for example, to improve employment, reduce social security expenditure, but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria.	1.3873545449564046
Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries.	0.8686119381931131
The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries.	1.2260791053531868
All in all, both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole.	1.2692807024265553
This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches.	1.10939353367367
To use a figure of speech, cappuccino is not always good for us.	1.072041074502022
Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled.	1.6036764264523702
The European Union' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy.	1.360158296295937
So far, social policy has remained limited in terms of set-up and resources.	1.1366452455353329
But under the influence of the free movement of employees, of the internal market and of the euro, the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated.	1.3957696934032975
This has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent.	0.9006584097164525
Cross-border workers, employees on secondment and migrating employees, as well as job-seekers, students on placement and other students, experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement. This is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection.	1.0670931130882708
In fact, the same phenomenon occurs in tax law.	1.153011144005195
In order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping, the Commission has, in my opinion, developed a well-balanced approach which steers a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention.	1.169293264988415
On the one hand, binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand, programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion.	1.0334854617157945
Based on a number of recommendations, reports and communications, the Commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high-ranking officials.	1.201941642011108
Both proposals have already been accepted by the Council and it is thus a matter of endorsing this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time, with knowledge of all facts and/or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be reorganised in the European Union.	1.3845652030089308
Indeed, expansion, globalisation, a sharp increase in the ageing population, individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable.	1.0897044309287478
Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection.	0.744206757466696
With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists, I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection.	1.17440084292641
Indeed, if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition, this would also harm social protection as a production factor.	1.3998660816549269
And less social protection means less purchasing power, fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees.	0.74636866488976
In respect of the super-Europeans, I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable.	1.1608652642285018
The discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions, rightful claimants, revenue or benefits, etc. It is thus impossible to bring all States into line.	1.167663133064736
The path which the Commission is walking is, in fact, obvious.	1.350667864485339
It has the advantage of clarity, and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid, comparative indicators and put forward recommendations.	1.1819265200451472
I endorse this view.	0.4741813530799597
I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter.	1.4411553822977385
Mr President, Mr Andersson' s report contains a lot that is of interest.	1.402194190982207
Unfortunately, what is most interesting is that the report, which purports to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy, instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere.	1.422029996549614
Social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States.	1.0289270327133602
Even though the socialists, now that there are so many social democratic governments, talk much less about unemployment than they used to, the unemployment in question is still high, and this in spite of the trade boom.	1.486601876867094
Something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so-called European model into a parody.	0.9631885902802535
Social policy must facilitate employment, creating incentives for employers and employees to, respectively, provide and accept jobs.	1.0284932305496535
Mr Andersson' s report demands social convergence, that is to say that systems should be increasingly standardised within and throughout the EU.	1.0580221281934485
The EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria, which would be binding and of real effect.	1.217208220507181
Mr Andersson also wants to see efficient and ambitious tax coordination, that is to say supranationalism in the fiscal sphere.	1.0119103835072238
The EU should also, on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty thresholds, table recommendations concerning what is called the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the Member States.	1.1378669167260127
The EU should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created, whatever that may mean.	1.1980401901613602
It is certainly not going to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulations and forms of interference.	1.21400901001611
Those structural problems which make unemployment higher in Europe than in the United States will become even greater.	1.0104191003756557
There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area.	1.217234043927779
The Member States can devise their own systems in the social sphere, each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences.	1.3771866459962492
It is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the EU.	1.028136458096818
Mr Andersson thinks that the less wealthy Eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too.	1.0940680922647115
It is obvious, however, that these countries, impoverished within a Communist economic system, cannot cope with a social policy like, for example, Sweden' s.	1.428800838060541
Talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present Member States and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant States are concerned.	1.1901618206291424
Mr President, as others have done, I should also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for the report he has produced.	1.4281142667398372
He has done a great deal of work on behalf of Parliament in producing a wide-ranging consensus on what is, by any definition, a thorny issue, not just in this Parliament but in virtually every Member State.	1.5250447706492454
I also welcome the Commission's communication.	1.180759078786802
It was slow in coming but well worth waiting for.	0.7975584582531746
It could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe, providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it.	1.254304123899535
We can, and must, take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century, a century which is globalising fast.	1.1515054989311249
I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world.	1.252134991587787
To be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy, our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense, are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole.	1.4714683642408228
We have to ensure that our ECOFIN ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which is creative, has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens.	1.4811388716287017
This is not an option for us any more.	1.2009346790788613
It is an imperative.	1.1460778016676072
European citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings.	1.0571970036434655
We do not want the US model - a model which has spectacularly failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life.	1.4230837434537265
What it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States.	1.086633329671375
That is not what we want to do in Europe.	1.3329602354191208
We have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things.	1.4598927022544244
But we have to grasp the tools to do that.	1.333189160107876
I therefore urge that we not only implement the high-level group as proposed by the Commission but also go further and have a Luxembourg-type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection.	1.3909828142137768
Mr President, Commissioner, this is one of the social areas to which the European Union ought to pay much more attention.	1.366976701179142
Macroeconomic policies, the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people' s lives, specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes, particularly of the minimum pensions, and through fighting social exclusion.	1.3488524345035744
This situation is particularly serious in countries such as Portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn, is the lowest in the whole of Europe.	1.1601908221156974
Therefore, while the Commission does not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policies to create more jobs of quality, with employee rights, which is a fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a solid, public social protection system, we harbour serious doubts as to its position.	1.4696967306050543
Although the Andersson report has gathered some positive proposals, including some that we put forward ourselves, we are still critical of some of the bases for the Commission' s proposal and we still have concerns about the strategy for modernising social protection.	1.2618423556278113
Mr President, in my previous life I ran two manufacturing businesses, one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands.	1.5329401932458673
As the UK business grew, we invested in more people, as the Dutch business grew we invested in more machinery.	1.3105994653441138
The simple reason for this was that social costs in the Netherlands were just too high in comparison.	1.2091461204869638
I am in favour of social protection, I am in favour of the original Commission document, but I do not want to see people priced out of jobs because social protection costs become unrealistically high.	1.2521601327874932
That is why in committee I proposed some form of business impact assessment, so that costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account, and the EPP-DE Group supported this amendment.	1.3698569937991398
But I must record that other groups, led by the PSE Group, guided by my countryman, Stephen Hughes, voted this out.	1.0665669474414623
I accept that Mr Andersson's report is very well-intentioned, and I respect him for the work he has done, but in my view the way the report defines and promotes social convergence would drive social costs higher throughout the EU.	1.458502204791759
This would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by showing how remote we are from the real world.	1.1098525889218023
I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal, which was very well-balanced, stand unamended.	1.3931107669592977
Mr President, we are unable to vote for this report.	1.2071877117173844
The European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe.	1.2312652158970976
Social rights should determine economic choices, and not the other way around.	1.3197392235733185
This is why, when it comes to social protection, we are opposed to schemes copied from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale: broad economic guidelines, then convergence criteria and, finally, social issues, dealt with as the last resort.	1.36500524672991
The European Union should proclaim one general principle, to wit, that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted.	1.5362403897339418
Any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator.	0.8381061865535075
In order to strengthen the funding of social security systems, we need a policy of general wage increase, the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State.	1.348711966439219
In order to fight poverty, entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights.	0.9320152206272547
Finally, in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity, the European Union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system.	1.3558821915161692
I sincerely hope, in conclusion, that social Europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes.	1.336202703772162
For millions of people the situation is too tragic for that.	1.0671047222988512
Mr President, Commissioner, the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the European Union is certainly an admirable one. Just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the Luxembourg Summit was commendable.	1.3283135243795285
The labour market and social protection are, in fact, two sides of the same coin, that require harmonised policies and rules.	1.5534299372224445
If the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment, flexibility and salary discipline, then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function, and vice versa.	1.226179268869427
Until recently, the European countries fixed, it could be said in an autarkic way, the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets.	1.5849588083449364
Budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability.	0.7701955390709553
With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency, budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness.	0.8353338259462192
The structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot, therefore, be rebalanced through budget deficits and trade.	1.2200053711620555
That being the case, in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union, and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level, it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria, the so-called exogenous asymmetric shocks.	1.2231237212078814
And therein lies the paradox.	0.5301543787094686
Political and monetary convergence in Europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems.	1.0619083300200607
But, at the same time, the single currency and the absence of labour mobility, as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy, force us into a situation of non-convergence in terms of salaries and welfare, in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels.	1.105074297928277
Hypocrisy and fine-sounding words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernisation and concerted action are not going to extricate us from those contradictions.	1.029199509494857
Either the European Union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources, genuine free movement of workers and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regimes, or it would be better not to deceive and be deceived by hopeless paths to convergence which sound impressive but which, in reality, only cause harm, above all to the most vulnerable.	1.3818952435183278
That is something we would do well to recognise.	1.0094578171674096
Mr President, unlike several of those who have spoken in today' s debate, I am inclined to endorse the Andersson report, one of the reasons for this being that I can see clear differences between the report and the Commission' s communications.	1.5505115736964663
In particular, I am referring to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the European social model' s approach, which is one based on solidarity.	1.3643164485126105
I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping, together with the right to a basic level of social security, the goal of social convergence, and, in particular, the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy.	1.3375560325330753
I can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state, model.	1.2928066930161077
All in all, though, I deem this report to be worthwhile.	1.3282533880669918
Mr President, I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection, which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe.	1.321073206477873
This message is contained in the excellent report by Mr Andersson.	0.8227281347932406
Europe, the European Union, although it is very strong in economic and political terms, will remain shaky, weak and limited, perhaps inadequate, if we are not able to strengthen it from a social point of view.	1.4272560677859778
I believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it, but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged.	1.3700478607356517
Bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income, I believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the European Union.	1.325688394066646
Let us not forget that, in 1999, 717,000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate.	1.0783521748432654
In social terms, it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain.	1.5309372479390753
We must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes, mergers, take-overs, new technologies etc.	1.1795434727926855
What is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs, for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity, because sometimes, as the title of the film states, the postman always rings twice.	1.4278563670667037
In my humble opinion, it is the responsibility of all European, national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion.	1.3269846970492674
It seems to me, Commissioner, that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities.	1.3365172326662478
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work, which is the reason why there is broader agreement, and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution.	1.3718431499564674
I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said.	1.1845240890079203
First, I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled: "The future of social protection" and there have been statements from the European Parliament, those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk.	1.521187555433571
Today, we have the statement by Mr Andersson.	1.5186152950745253
I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection.	1.2981753488346806
The second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate.	1.5266423961257245
You know very well that the Treaty provides no legal basis for policies at European level, but there is the agreement expressed at the last Council, there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience, as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the Member States.	1.3489717932216558
The third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses, which relate to paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social convergence and lastly quality in health care, there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies.	1.3962484365435512
The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken.	0.8569376629382397
As you know, a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency, which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June.	1.386811389729417
The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things: sustainable pension systems and social accession.	1.0533871901200025
I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group.	1.2942668034208882
Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems, the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States, I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion.	1.3804012395842475
Of course, we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness, but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment.	1.4391414649915197
I think the statement' s content makes this clear.	1.1115864839960414
Ladies and gentlemen, the aim is that in the next year, and after a unanimous decision by the Council, we should progress to a first level of coordination, exchange of views, listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies.	1.474041053721786
As many of the speakers have said, I believe a first important step has been taken.	1.4421421197463744
Already at the Intergovernmental Conference, social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase, in which social policy will, to a large extent, become a European policy.	1.5036582496883852
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.	1.1865179062804914
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	0.28917441844220476
WIPO treaty	-0.0
The next item is the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)].	0.8865803382479959
Mr President, we are now taking a stance on an important issue, an international agreement, which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many Member States.	1.5226629487939183
In my own country, Sweden, one of our biggest export industries is affected, namely the music and sound recording industry.	1.0637963259324619
It is about artists' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products.	0.9593502357800756
It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty).	1.2816743684895073
Without protection under intellectual property law, creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed.	0.8473037223493982
Forgeries are big business.	0.4906441655683553
It is estimated that, in Europe alone, income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy.	1.2279086812305844
The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry.	0.8930087714475704
This is an historic agreement because the EU is the contracting party. This is the case, in spite of the fact that it is not the EU, but only the Member States, which belong to the organisation.	1.623069747746085
There exists a special clause which requires Parliament' s assent in two cases.	0.9382510154941779
With regard to the present agreement, both these conditions are fulfilled.	1.5269800080032987
A new institution is being created, an assembly which, in the future, will monitor the agreement and its consequences.	1.4767330841310895
The agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure.	1.1134198063394587
Parliament must therefore give its assent, because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence.	1.1961276749264933
The future will show whether it is right, by means of this new parliamentary assembly, to reduce the Commission' s powers regarding these issues.	1.5059277765202939
Parliament cannot, in any case, at present do anything about the matter.	1.327561534668731
The agreement complements the Berne Convention in regard to literary works.	0.673793486543779
It creates international legal protection in connection with distribution, sale, rental, public reproduction and the making available of works.	1.0954949920267192
It also creates protection for software and databases.	0.6307790477495838
There are problems regarding the term "author" .	0.8572917053427415
For example, it has not been defined.	1.41551011166811
Another issue, which is somewhat problematic, is that of intermediate storage.	1.5632778409409882
This too has not been solved.	0.8430134542065378
It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition.	0.9156072248166283
If no definitions are provided in questions such as this, it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world, with no uniformity of approach.	1.23505667606412
That would not be a good thing.	1.0613025690326785
The question of arbitration procedures is still to be resolved, too.	1.1772904502394115
Parliament cannot change these details.	0.5599821558080423
We can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands.	1.2346930397682636
Yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies.	1.0527267820447987
Both myself, as rapporteur, and the committee think we ought to say yes.	1.578006742157931
We have here an agreement which, in spite of its defects, constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright.	1.2534758624258653
We have of course discussed at length whether Parliament and whether the EU should have powers in regard to patents under intellectual property law.	1.0561527846853955
I think they should have.	0.928389736060565
However, there is still no Community legislation in the areas of patent law and protection of designs, and there needs to be.	1.449996337394253
A European patent is in the offing, and that is a good thing.	1.294164988788539
Now, the Union and the Member States are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law.	1.3556599696885054
It is good for us that we have the power to do this, in spite of the fact that we are not completely satisfied.	1.4872828871806103
In that way, we can act as a model for the applicant States.	1.25715405660244
We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement.	1.2378164274606298
I want to thank the Commission for its efforts in this area and for the cooperation with the Commission' s officials, which has been quite excellent.	1.567879597750763
Finally, I also want to thank this Chamber for being so good as to listen to these words at this late hour.	1.2312532399339295
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, on her very serious work.	1.2151896772899493
She has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation' s treaties.	1.0748039289238467
Their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property.	1.2670654750885748
It is a fact that the road has been a long one, mainly because of the legal problem that arose in connection with the extent to which the Community could be considered to have absolute competence in matters of intellectual property.	1.3145458578279259
The problem has been overcome.	0.517191776091991
Today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties: the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations, performances and phonograms.	1.2931907725598648
As regards the first of these, it seems to provide an effective solution for the long-standing demands by the creators of artistic and literary works, while at the same time creating a framework of protection in relation to issues such as distribution, rental and the presentation of their works to the public.	1.2532658998289594
As regards the second treaty on performances and phonograms, it must be stressed that for the first time an international treaty signed by the Community as well recognises exclusive rights for performers, interpreters and artists for reproduction, distribution and rental to the public, and the right to fair remuneration for radio broadcasts.	1.1921955423864847
In that context a noteworthy and important step forward is the treaty' s treatment of the right of reproduction.	1.106943114415644
Even though, as the Commission says, the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development, it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created, performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the Treaty of Rome or even by the Community directives.	1.318642139767616
Interpreting Article 7 of the Treaty, we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in recordings, but also protection against copying, whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary, and protection against any other form of production.	1.2407264138669818
It would be appropriate, however, for us also to mention some points which should be at the focus of future WIPO work or the work of other diplomatic conferences.	1.3577258336534153
First, there is the right of distribution as referred to in Article 8(1).	1.258845605900642
The option accorded to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the Treaty' s most negative points, since there is nothing to prevent States from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right, a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists.	1.3031192335164479
As regards rental rights, on interpretation of Article 9, we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists, interpreters or performers, only if this is laid down by national legislation. I think this conflicts with Article 13.	1.4674327810935013
To conclude, I want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights.	0.9675270916406701
In the 21st century, the century of knowledge and the invisible economy, intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will, in many cases, be more important than traditional property.	1.2687349201548
We are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created, where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large.	1.214461199621955
Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which, nonetheless, concludes that, as a Community, our accession to these two WIPO treaties must not boil down to a mere institutional development, however important that may be, i.e. the opportunity for the European Community and the WIPO Assembly to work together.	1.5049846613659188
This ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of Europe.	1.1783633935047517
However, an objective is emerging behind this issue of Community accession, one I find as yet too theoretical but one that some Member States, nonetheless, find too offensive.	1.3972042009067853
This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy. In this connection, I expect our three institutions, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, to be in agreement.	1.6365567901492808
Cultural policy means, in particular, defending the role of the arts, recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards.	1.0674227839339685
In addition, at a time when Europe faces the task of defining a new policy on copyright and neighbouring rights, there is an urgent need - as has just been pointed out several times - to define and redefine what exactly an author is.	1.4478773559623928
Our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them.	0.9605453549518647
Mr President, Commissioner, the adoption of the WIPO agreements was a very positive step in the direction of the global information society.	1.331689369986677
The agreements crystallise the decades-old legacy of copyright, and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights.	1.068214083315332
The entry into force of the treaties and their final form is, however, in addition to this recommendation, dependent on implementation by the parties themselves.	1.2482189205664542
In the United States the WIPO Treaty has already entered into force, having been enacted into law by means of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the Treaty by means of this legislation.	1.1808284736304442
The EU too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the WIPO.	1.156486133339883
It is worrying that the position adopted by the previous Parliament does not support this balanced WIPO system.	1.0135652211690978
The opinion on the copyright directive at first reading was very distorted, and, furthermore, the balance is moving in a harmful direction from the point of view of Europeans.	1.178555982831585
The recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe, on the contrary.	1.2564524332379285
Parliament' s amendments would mainly improve opportunities for the media enterprises that are well established in the market to move their old, in excess of 80% market share to a new environment with rigid, excessive copyright regulations.	1.2264231122235267
I am not now speaking of Charlotte Cederschiöld' s recommendation, which is an excellent paper, but of the matters of copyright that the previous Parliament discussed.	1.4831886260891558
On one point of detail, I would like to thank Mrs Cederschiöld for having clarified, for example, the concept of so-called temporary copies in her opinion.	1.0924908669428806
There is no consciously adopted position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copies.	1.1425596924523949
If these, which technically speaking are copies, were covered by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information - as the recommendation quite rightly states - expensive and complicated for no good reason.	1.3325187482400593
It would be as if the deliveryman had to pay a copyright fee whenever he carried a book to be read by the purchaser.	1.0129592456959293
The real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the artist directly to the user, the consumer.	1.0993924250556595
The new operational environment is, above all, a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before.	1.1796659863395351
It is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account.	1.0536295084616178
Parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation.	1.0934128767721751
. (NL) Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out.	1.124470894664657
The Commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively.	1.1604709015757522
This is important.	0.5144527243763727
It befits the Commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur.	1.1801314366655795
I would like to present the Commission' s conclusion to you without any further ado: it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and, therefore, with ratification by this Parliament.	1.4381811148591128
I would like to stress the importance of both Treaties.	1.0031097941089102
Both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbouring rights and are, as such, a considerable improvement on the Berne Convention and the Treaty of Rome.	1.0710359014181146
Both Treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters, but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks.	1.1089434046444364
The two Treaties explicitly permit the Community to become a party to the Treaties and to play an important role in managing them.	1.203302771671477
Consequently, approval of the Treaties by the Community is of major importance, because it illustrates that the Community sets great store by intellectual property rights.	1.473013246566033
In addition, assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the European Union' s role in terms of copyright.	1.2093685034851238
At international level, there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly.	1.0507844448480583
These have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States, including the United States.	1.009942925254949
The entry into force of treaties largely depends on the European Union, because thirty ratification acts are required in order for treaties to enter into effect, and these acts that are signed by the European Union and the Member States, including associated countries, are of vital importance in order to reach this number.	1.42475250956552
The developing countries, too, expect the European Union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide.	1.2193204272443514
In this context, Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society, which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999.	1.270771159289716
This directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the WIPO Treaties.	1.0849213261362647
The European Parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of Article 300(3).	1.1292040971203483
It is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world, in the form of this recommendation.	1.0962871404208687
In a nutshell, I would like to reiterate the Commission' s conclusion here: it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property.	1.2841896589604564
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30a.m.	0.5587495291043448

Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	0.4510321946745718
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	0.3735514178617478
Are there any comments?	0.1337831580886173
Mr President, I see in the Minutes that two Members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to Strasbourg on Monday.	1.2008568926604368
I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam' s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled.	1.0281223222032896
We were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport.	0.5704153675928985
We were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival.	0.7931428001001064
In fact, it took 45 minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport.	1.1409017406043347
We finally got here, on Monday at 8.30 p.m., after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling.	1.277996569392887
This sort of service and difficulty in getting to Strasbourg on a Monday is quite hopeless.	0.8753497937067408
If the French Government insists that we continue to meet in Strasbourg, it could at least ensure, where flights are diverted to Basle, that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted passengers, otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on Monday and attend to any kind of business.	1.3142064866856065
I wonder if that could be added to the Minutes.	0.8625375535679646
Mr President, I was booked on the same flight and I am rather embarrassed to admit that the airline was KLM, our national airline company.	1.4188797415482155
I hope that next time, also if any other airline company is involved, things will run more smoothly.	1.2181116084729893
(The Minutes were approved)	0.08791063492812108
Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today' s agenda. We decided on Monday that the Council' s statement on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Geneva Convention was to be postponed.	1.2281115030435348
I would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today, and not about the Geneva Convention.	1.325376078790899
This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March.	0.79695536601189
It was erroneously included in today' s agenda.	0.6355505838692673
Mr Swoboda, I can confirm what you have just said and there is, in fact, a printing error.	1.4663557303369519
The document that has been distributed contains inaccuracies, because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate.	1.2349620382752418
Mr President, I just want to say that, as I was walking in this morning, I noticed two people smoking outside the Hemicycle.	1.366544025957086
The smell is absolutely disgusting!	0.5776125353718379
Can you please do something about it?	0.8570476710502839
I cannot do anything about it myself, but you are quite right. We need a quick way of educating people, including those who do not obey the rules decided upon in this House.	1.4840535377188289
Regarding the problems caused by air travel delays, perhaps everybody who has had difficulty reaching Strasbourg for the present part-session should form a small group - although I am not sure that it will be small - to discuss the precise nature of the problems encountered.	1.2775436112722038
Coherence of EU policies with development	0.17169691557073588
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of EU policies with development.	0.9737342433059426
Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency, particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament is bound to play in the near future, given the need to strengthen development policies at European Union level.	1.5514479615250576
The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today, is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy.	1.3090451848237268
I shall, of course, give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making. I would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel, at EU level, to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years, which has benefited people in all walks of life, throughout the world, in terms of well-being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that, at the same time, there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world.	1.3695692952948901
This endangers the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace.	1.1242621282589746
We are all therefore duty-bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet.	1.1896042179860364
The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets.	1.3200176457289776
A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged, which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments, which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies.	1.3672788668699025
We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas:	1.291472900549304
Firstly, there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players, by which I mean donors, requiring greater coordination, greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems.	1.2520626172798512
At the same time, however, there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate, particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems, together with a need to focus special attention on these countries' own policies for reducing poverty.	1.2704413984685277
The second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development.	1.2749194231933434
This means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy, but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance, trade and investment. Furthermore, this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries' own policies.	1.3687035450406608
A third aspect of this new model that I would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives.	1.2109993484543666
Since 1995, following a concerted international effort between the main donor states, involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD' s Development Assistance Committee, it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies, both at national and international level.	1.2805677651138772
As you will know, the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50% by 2015, by increasing compulsory schooling, by significantly reducing child mortality rates, and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective.	1.3147259104412157
This would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world' s population lives, and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively.	1.4579211538911436
And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise. Particularly in recent years, development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter, and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership.	1.3807048033807812
The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here, as has the Bretton Woods system.	1.3500646517100814
I have in mind, in particular, the important impetus given to this debate by the World Bank, especially through its Comprehensive Framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund, where, for the first time, an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto unimaginable link, for a body of this type, between debt relief and poverty.	1.404362446088281
This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context.	1.2502302090565016
The Portuguese Presidency has highlighted the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies, and to create greater scope for coordination, in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system.	1.6525061348668881
If we are to strengthen the European Union' s role in international development policies, we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action.	1.1376004825919412
Firstly, we need to make the EU' s development policy more effective.	1.3454132411603434
As you know, an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies, and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency.	1.3538392586695531
The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues.	1.218723401964087
The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies, the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union' s present cooperation policies, the need to make the EU' s aid management more efficient and, in particular, to review its mechanisms for intervention, and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid.	1.4027373823444254
A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more.	1.1857230398593732
It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States' national policies, which are not always complementary or well coordinated. A great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the European Union and its Member States is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual Member States and the proposals and actions of the European institutions.	1.3379397232633676
In this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost, as soon as possible, to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary.	1.5414680475384945
The third aspect I would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of EU policies, the central theme of today' s debate.	1.2308544152471896
Firstly, we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other European Union policies, so that development objectives can be achieved, not merely through aid and support, but also, first and foremost, through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development.	1.413855110671719
As you know, a Council Resolution was approved, in June 1997, under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports.	1.3661527162725584
The first such report was presented to the Council in May 1999, and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination, notably in the fields of peace building, food safety, fisheries and migration.	1.286739671035768
But as you will also be aware, we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence, together with the communication on development policy.	1.446699651127318
Over the coming months, that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency, this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us.	1.3822104681227707
It is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the European Union. Only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies.	1.24739591407248
But, quite apart from this, we would like to emphasise that, if we are to strengthen the coherence of European Union policies in the present circumstances and in the economic situation currently facing the Union, we need to give serious consideration to various issues associated with the dynamics of the European Union itself.	1.450780066433563
By this I mean, of course, the internal dynamics of the European Union.	0.9747754126162287
We know that the European Union has its own dynamics, which stem above all from the Treaty of Amsterdam, which has reinforced its political dimension. This inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development.	1.4992323830662664
We will also have to await the outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference as regards enlargement, to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the European Union are directed towards increasing the coherence of its policies, and, as regards development in particular, to what extent it also contributes to appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving this objective.	1.4178512183608891
The second aspect that we need to consider, in relation to the coherence of policies, is development policy in the context of the Union' s foreign policy.	1.372916911622631
We know that the Union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy, and we know that, with the creation of the High Representative, of the Rapid Reaction Force and of the military crisis management capacity, there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the European Union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies. We also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue, with the adoption of common positions or joint actions, with the preparation of joint strategies, with preventive diplomacy, and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management.	1.5528933716162434
There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union' s foreign policy.	1.145625749372526
It has to be said that, in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy, the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies.	1.322457110266481
The success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy, so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy.	1.1834637083138104
In this context, we are convinced that we need to move away from the post­colonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid. I say this because we know that, in Europe, development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain Member States, in view of the post-colonial concerns of those states.	1.4187264807481883
The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States' policy.	1.2589161319361517
Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States' policies with the European Union' s development policy.	1.2036701577901456
If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies, it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy.	1.1421002686349075
Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention, regarding development policy, is, of course, the Development Council. There have been discussions, especially in recent months, about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies.	1.471270360716231
As you know, there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other EU policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the EDF' s financing, or rather lack of financing.	1.2080413851376484
It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union' s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions, which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils, in other decision-making forums, ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council. Up to now, the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions.	1.4049519552371472
So without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which, although it directly impacts on the European Union' s development policy, is largely being dealt with outside this decision-making forum, it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objectives.	1.3577451017252267
The views of the European Parliament on this issue too, will certainly be both timely and welcome.	1.5545671020963643
. Let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries.	1.064196273520298
I would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations.	1.2916399796277733
I saw Member States working as a team, which was indeed a wonderful experience.	1.2329088040696718
There was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over, not just because it was over, but because we all knew that we had achieved something together, the EU and the 71 ACP countries.	1.3909901574967223
That is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation.	1.442089332878534
I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement.	1.2583964113648158
We explicitly address corruption; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever.	1.2114458539761366
We promote participatory approaches, we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reforms and policies to be supported by the EU.	1.3373654671702666
We refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies.	0.7159791581657973
We base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country's needs, but also of its policy performance.	1.2959295430520987
We create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector.	0.9499335273632104
We rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming, allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme.	1.0940319823896902
We decentralise administrative and, in some cases, financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective.	1.1187447635343042
We improve the policy framework for trade and investment development.	0.9076944081322122
We enhance cooperation in all areas important to trade, including new issues such as labour standards and the linkages between environment and trade.	1.161949823103509
After Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements.	1.010886886548899
Let me turn to some of the more important points.	1.017837933686354
Firstly the agreement on political issues.	0.8442844165285429
The new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active Community support.	1.3116337712839643
Secondly, a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.	1.1071856276415735
In comparison with the current procedure, the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process, with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation.	1.4023819676291354
In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements, measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified.	1.2910694832922063
Thirdly, the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption.	1.3093910946650436
This is a real innovation, both in the EU/ACP context and in international relations in general.	1.2652253932749185
This procedure will be applied, not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money, but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development.	1.201012154759084
It is thus not confined to EC activities.	0.8282384652109375
This is a very important aspect, taking into account the fundability of public finances.	1.1228638757171248
By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement, the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors.	1.1389042606911695
Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration.	0.9393758128158153
We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area.	0.9167344206459433
This new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999.	1.3136662237776826
The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions.	1.1854135198278695
The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration.	1.3500935214810885
We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration.	0.7657515466108934
The EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining, within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country, the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party.	1.1939952353591012
This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons.	0.8019781444423694
These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance.	0.8765950110668017
The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid.	0.9777588002521703
We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters.	1.1898887170280779
We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned.	1.351863721520886
Negotiations will start no later than 2002.	0.655397587405049
This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries' capacity to conduct trade negotiations.	1.0159001447663523
A six-year period is programmed for these negotiations.	0.8384759396488243
We will take account of the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways: firstly, through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and, secondly, by helping the ACP states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral forums.	1.3698397075747972
This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime.	0.8416215129334383
Economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners.	0.9661028021030836
Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred, all of which will boost the ACP countries' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy.	1.133864360424595
In addition, the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor.	1.423731585771549
They will lock in the economic reforms, just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties' commitments under the agreements.	1.1128002274622213
The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction.	1.1297297080804367
Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU' s trade regime for all least-developed countries, 39 of which are actually in the ACP group.	1.2408306503831534
This process will take place in the coming five years so that, by 2005, the LDCs' exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market.	1.3618281826461898
As regards the volume of the next EDF, the EU has made its financial proposal.	1.4228863776701324
It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective.	1.0914675673928393
Today about EUR 9.5 billion of previous EDF resources are uncommitted.	0.8748659088444791
The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances, plus the new EDF resources, over a seven-year period, that is to say, before the entry into force of the next financial protocol.	1.1621226167219476
This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period.	0.9611924691713012
We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity, we are moving into a period of increased activity.	1.2643654756485598
Such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides.	0.848806418224247
There is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such, and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries.	1.715171515901772
Turning to our development policy, I would say that the global context has changed drastically.	1.30049651228548
The marginalisation of many economies, increased poverty in the world, the need for better management of environmental interdependence, the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns.	1.177914240612102
It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves.	1.0978738827834127
Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned.	1.0766763540747701
To focus on the input coming from the evaluations, I would mention the following problems: the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence.	1.1850261785695975
This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States.	1.1183992753639826
The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures and institutional mechanisms.	1.1856215719996108
Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities.	1.014759216218818
Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage.	1.0938948954476246
On average, to manage $US 10 million of aid there are 2.9 staff at the Commission, compared with 4.3 at the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in major Member States.	1.162211250868594
This is a real problem: there are too many different financial instruments, each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings.	1.4320102707675237
This is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system.	0.9622760819732281
In order to face and solve these problems the Community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament.	1.1707476720916647
It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework, that is, the Council and Parliament.	1.44183385480731
The lack of concerted action among the 15 Member States themselves and between them and the Community also needs to be addressed.	1.0110390109946936
By focusing the Community's development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States.	0.9906989049576761
This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado.	1.074515292021969
When we talk policies nowadays, we engage in a process of convergence.	1.4572850076449078
This is part of the solution.	0.7390752791401359
We are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for Community action.	1.0405364793791871
Everything has become more and more complex.	0.7577457283157895
This is also true of development cooperation.	1.496755647179016
No single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes, ranging from macro-economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting themes such as gender, environment, good governance and institutional reforms.	1.1225277717809303
It is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country.	1.1397691521545055
This should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for Community action.	1.0960892120744616
This is where we want to go.	1.310840755355295
To identify the EC's priority areas of support, account has to be taken of the Community's specific features in relation to the Member States and to international institutions.	1.4305032253870449
I will mention just a few: our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation; our neutrality and defence of overall Community interests; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to do relatively large jobs compared to what individual Member States can normally do.	1.158598152704374
Also, our presence on the ground: basically, I find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves, we are seen as a neutral, welcome partner for this experiment world-wide - something which nobody else can claim to be.	1.3537720296379911
It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework.	1.1133643256312098
It is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up, by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement.	1.5021799534776175
We will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested.	1.2892455540126195
I see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate.	1.1648952776129684
Parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect.	1.1919140080490562
This will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing.	1.1735958456552227
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson.	1.13323981567105
I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF.	0.9688529535895298
The problem, however, should not be sought within this Parliament or the Commission; it is the Council that needs to make a decision on the EDF budget. This sermon, therefore, really belongs in the Council.	1.4826740321630656
Mr President, I thank Mr Nielson.	1.4309135413782939
He has talked extensively about the new Lomé Convention, although this is not really the topic of this morning' s meeting.	1.3600183653285713
We want to talk about coherence.	0.9046874314090729
This is the topic.	1.169956554281909
Ever since the early nineties, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognised that this coherence of European policy is leaves something to be desired, especially in the field of development cooperation and in other EU policies.	1.496990371167968
This problem has been highlighted on several occasions, to whit in 1992, in 1995 and 1997.	1.23299573339669
The examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us.	1.0523451635565255
I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now.	1.0218855468696686
In fact, the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997.	1.255382613601043
In 1998, it was agreed that the European Commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements.	1.4192249680544589
But what have we seen since then?	0.6383165567004808
Fine words, as is the case again today, but no report. It is too crazy for words, really.	1.7515536485318888
It is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy. Time and time again, good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented.	1.2124156836449895
It is, therefore, with good reason that we bring this up here today.	1.1726096277107454
I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions.	1.2245450769068735
A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production.	0.7947372713305113
In the Union, sugar is produced from sugar beet.	0.9547825322090504
In order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive EU sugar, a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar.	1.1877534118815993
The result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the Union is significantly restricted.	1.2417652825233128
At the same time, we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid.	1.0455514966172867
A Minister from one of the Caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me: If you just allowed our sugar access to the European Union, we would not need your development aid at all.	1.2537841300149173
Another example is cacao.	0.5154887422476364
The European Union intends to permit 5% of alternative fats in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market.	1.1040141343610796
This could just as well be 0% - the internal market would still be harmonised.	1.2591714223225612
By pitching the percentage level at 5%, which is now likely to be the case, it is almost certain that hundreds of thousands of small cacao farmers in developing countries will be put at a disadvantage.	1.348445834836499
It seems to be heading this way nevertheless.	1.0765310546590299
What are we actually doing then?	0.8032371712575266
This is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what Brussels actually does?	1.0578985820595939
It seems that European industry is more important here than our own principles, our own coherences and the interests of the developing countries.	1.261478445939217
There are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes.	1.0364068485894329
Why institute an oil boycott against Haiti and not against Burma, where an elected President is imprisoned, parliament has been sent home and some of the MPs have been put in jail or even murdered?	1.1211186944944243
Why not institute an oil boycott against Sudan, where a great deal of the fighting is still going on, with weapons, no less, funded by the oil companies which are based in the same areas where the refugees are?	1.2873978345176949
The inconsistency is astonishing.	0.41265794079867746
Here too, Mr Nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new Lomé Convention.	1.0985166816482514
If the new Lomé Convention is simply put into operation, without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy, the policy will then be built on shifting sands - to use a biblical expression.	1.370348430923729
The Council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time: in agriculture, commerce, in conflict prevention, in the peace operations, in the fisheries sector, migration and environment.	1.4826162006360566
Mr Nielson, what we are waiting for is a good report on these inconsistencies and a number of specific proposals to eliminate these from the policy.	1.2606931237931502
Once again, all your fine examples, your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary of State in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground.	1.29523133759781
This is also at the request of the citizens.	1.1547400413770565
We have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992: this is the topic of this debate.	1.3361610058831528
I hope the message strikes home and I really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures.	1.2894669986315634
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the same line as Mrs Maij-Weggen, I believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate.	1.0790152942857911
The topic touches the very core of the European Union.	0.6823934373431209
Let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating. Article 178, Title XX of the consolidated Treaties of the European Union reads as follows: "The Community shall take account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries" .	1.2418513239415325
What are the objectives which each EU policy needs to take into account?	1.2271457559027412
Article 177 specifies these objectives as "sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them" , the "smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries" .	1.2384718801058632
Mr President, these are no arbitrary objectives. These are articles, statutory articles, which form part of the European acquis established by law with which the European institutions and Member States must comply.	1.5660896416389243
Every statutory article should, of course, not just be judged on its regularity, but also on the importance of its contents.	1.349158987116721
I am of the opinion - and luckily I am not alone in this - that the principle of policy coherence is essential to every government which aims to be a credible servant of its citizens.	1.3758610227026224
The interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government.	1.24969852938763
This is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society, and also important from the point of view of effectiveness, for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently.	1.3866355003858373
We should not make reality out to be more rose-tinted than it really is.	1.1915060859844253
Reality is obstinate.	0.3380706879234157
It is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner, without any backhandedness.	1.2531427608498944
The government is obliged to show up any of its dilemmas, and to show where, when and why, problems occur with coherence of policy, rather than sweeping it all under the carpet.	1.3910430355232506
What we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure.	1.241471962431948
Poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention.	1.0054770978432603
It is only natural that we in Parliament guard the interests of our citizens, but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable, international environment, in which the goal of human safety is pursued.	1.5581988138277407
This is a moral interest, a safety interest and is, ultimately, even in the interest of our economy.	1.3778621776837403
In whose interest is it really if European taxpayers' money is used to support economic development in Namibia, and if, at the same time, the economic activity of poor cattle farmers in the same country is drastically undercut by rigorous export subsidies, financed by the same tax payers?	1.1710283059911568
We are all acting as if this is not really happening, but we all know that it is.	1.6100737987979181
It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand.	1.1429205361165604
The general interest of policy coherence is, therefore, a responsibility of the Commission as a whole, of the Council, and of the European Parliament.	1.5934868189225755
This responsibility cannot only be borne by the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, however much we like to see him or hear him talk, or by the Development Council or the parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation.	1.3827563814440516
What we need here is an integral approach.	1.0745407571912242
After the lucid and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson, I would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals, not only by Mr Nielson, but by the entire Commission, in order to make the policy coherent as a whole.	1.3783474426119722
This is why we urge the Commission, in this sharp and clear resolution, to develop specific instruments.	1.6144850672406896
We need to pinpoint, and draw up an inventory of, the problem areas for coherence.	1.47731080031512
We need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved.	1.3866908226581227
This is why I advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent.	1.1150172772598368
This is why we need to set up inter-service task groups in the Commission, in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence.	1.4340667105632128
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if our neighbour' s roof is leaking, we can lend him pots and pans to collect the water, but it is, of course, more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof.	1.2764951083301836
The crisis in last year' s Commission has been solved today, but the Commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach, which, no doubt, the entire Parliament will soon demand in the resolution.	1.4962965861332247
I would wish the Commissioner all the best in his battle within the Commission and wish Mr Amado the same within the Council.	1.1902424173266943
Mr President, let us be clear from the outset: when it comes to cooperation, coherence is far from being the watchword.	1.5036143655831395
The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but, as the previous speakers have explained so well, there are various distortions to these declarations.	1.5175678074147574
The first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the Union and the Member States on individual cooperation policies.	1.1260262950406796
This gives rise to serious malfunctions, because some Community programmes duplicate national programmes, whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done.	1.0565184386219475
And let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop.	1.0571803365935855
The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes.	0.9416839787942063
We state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State.	1.0583639185106806
The third area of incoherence is human rights.	0.7538353302199251
We say that we want to protect human rights.	1.1587318473303854
We encourage developing countries to respect human rights.	0.8215691153287173
We even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights.	0.6396777054876611
We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns.	0.6980824309244992
And yet, at the same time, we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti-personnel mines.	1.1568459836521108
Nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations.	0.8407310001800002
The fourth area of incoherence in the European Union' s cooperation policy is this: how do you expect to help development by pillaging the natural resources of the people you are helping.	1.2549423431329343
The European Union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries.	1.0541644215709245
We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them.	0.7537134010685101
I will not even mention oil; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa.	1.2477589016815813
Furthermore, and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence, we demand respect for biodiversity, for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature; but at the same time, and this was apparent during recent negotiations, we force ACP countries to sign TRIPS agreements.	1.4130354278046044
These agreements risk being extended to living organisms, which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto slavery for small-scale farmers in the south, at the hands of the multinationals.	1.261007962318569
And yet, and this is the sixth area of incoherence, we do not defend the application of the current Treaties.	1.4364207256353205
On the one hand, we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and, on the other hand, we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same TRIPS, despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the AIDS massacre.	1.3125178852663226
Similarly, during the WTO negotiations, at a time when, to quote the second paragraph of the Schwaiger report, "the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries, especially the poor" , the European Union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring ACP countries, albeit with a transitional period of several years, instead of strengthening it, especially for the poorest countries.	1.3403009090617168
The eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature.	1.272314185346386
We are always saying think globally, act locally.	0.8182817330375326
And yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs.	1.028565623736141
And what about agriculture and the environment? Still more problems, still more areas of incoherence which I might have highlighted, not to mention research, emigration or health.	1.2809929454624251
In short, we claim that we want to help developing countries and, at the same time, we encourage the liberalisation of trade, which we acknowledge runs counter to that very objective.	1.317907039052213
I say it again, the European Union' s cooperation and development policy is not coherent. and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament, the institutions and the Commission to make a joint effort, at long last, to put some coherence into our policy.	1.6512875490211203
Mr President, I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate, not just because development is in general an important issue, but because it is also a topical one.	1.5504270588176994
Seattle was a failure, and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.	1.2711324582086185
The meeting held in that North American city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries.	0.8718407108006634
The Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is being held right now in Bangkok, and is suffering the consequences of that failure.	1.3227319634743429
In the meantime, however, as has already been mentioned, the negotiations on the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded.	1.3441424744198736
This goes to show just how topical this subject is.	0.7615620429779454
We could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April.	1.0740219117857348
However, I would also like to add that any analysis, no matter how superficial, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north-south relations, including those between the European Union and the less developed countries.	1.4470266514191186
You only have to realise that the category of "least developed countries" has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years, and now represents 13% of the world' s population, yet this category only accounts for 0.4% of world exports and 0.6% of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23% since 1990.	1.1613820783464743
Furthermore, the recent Community budget cuts in this area, for the present financial year, are part of this trend, as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message.	1.4177714494604607
Michel Camdessus, a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund, said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference, and I am now quoting, that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other. He was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries.	1.4194330909652733
It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position, but he did indeed say this, and I heard it with my own ears.	1.4678260844444284
This comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation, and I accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north-south relations and break the mould.	1.339110818243278
In particular, we need to reconsider the role of the European Union in this area, as I am certain that one of the Union' s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order. It is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation, bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based, and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries, particularly in this context.	1.4660974110880953
A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries.	0.8223630427923522
This is a positive development in itself, especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue.	1.312539777898896
We will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth, but meanwhile there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time, even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points.	1.4067807085182116
Certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these.	1.0942722327078178
This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions, and this is certainly true of the European Union, especially in the field of good governance and trade.	1.3151333076680707
But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group, which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle.	1.375098060664193
I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging, especially as regards trade, and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area.	1.3526437723576756
Lastly, we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries.	1.3031904353180352
I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects, indebtedness, assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety, humanitarian, educational and health-related issues, and also fields such as the environment, investment and access to information and new technologies. This also applies to the sphere of trade, where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies, and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States.	1.269365379838402
We cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed.	1.1385724924892258
Mr President, having listened to the Council and the Commission today, I just had to look at my agenda.	1.5715143105174347
Yes, it does say: 'Coherence of different Union policies with development policy' .	1.188815727957153
But we have not heard a single word on this subject, and I find that deeply embarrassing.	1.5336389679899414
We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years.	1.2077906691841975
It ought to have been here in writing today and, after having heard Mr Nielson' s speech, I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission.	1.4320371763263502
I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence, and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today.	1.4121801263678158
Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence, I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism, namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new, relevant legislation from this aspect.	1.351232112958285
I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the EU' s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries: dumping of beef in Sahel and South Africa, tomato purée in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica.	1.032886202220826
The examples are, I hope, all well known. In any case, they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU-subsidised products.	1.3554284656236633
European taxpayers contribute EUR 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the EU.	0.819364004486662
This is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries, which accounts for 69% of the total work force there compared with 1.7% in the EU.	1.2077059434141213
Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34% of the developing countries' gross national product, compared with 5.3% in the EU.	1.2081487582444104
There is neither coherence nor human decency here.	0.6556646470217107
Why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact?	0.8048590483969602
Mr President, how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental.	1.315313292287641
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council.	1.1549990043380949
They pointed out that the UK, France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population.	1.3080885277981935
They then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto.	1.1721678375468647
Is the Council discussing this issue?	0.8584544177651
Is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of Council members, rather than a vote reflecting the population in Europe which they democratically represent?	1.11557487233907
Have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what, if any, consideration has been given to it?	1.173833960954868
As this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union, surely it should receive priority consideration.	1.2975657241698906
How decisions are made is all-important.	0.8101820763315373
co-president of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly. Mr President, I thank the Council and the Commission for their statements this morning, but I will concentrate on coherence policy because that is what the agenda says we are talking about.	1.3683784129616914
Much as I agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different Union policies and development policy, I question whether today is the time to be holding it.	1.3602212783621916
However, the Council statement gave me hope for the future.	1.4273454694520733
It is quite obvious to me, as someone who specialises in development policy, that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations.	1.3766895862937938
I will give some examples shortly.	0.9853353674061412
However, I remind this House that, back in June 1997, a Council resolution acknowledged the fact that there is a serious lack of coherence in some of the EU policies in relation to its development cooperation policy.	1.5328617153689874
This was followed by a request from the Council to the Commission to provide an annual report, the first of which was to be discussed in 1998.	1.55118161273806
We still await the first report, and that is why I believe this debate was premature, as the Commission had little to say on coherence this morning.	1.6370398663482093
The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important, such as peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution, food security, fisheries and immigration.	1.3061535273332503
Some of these issues have been discussed in depth.	1.395780556068184
I personally feel that issues such as peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of African Heads of State, with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU acting as arbiter.	1.283073176298694
The issues that are really affected by lack of coherence are in areas such agriculture, trade, environment and biodiversity, but herein lies the real problem: these are the highly sensitive areas of policy within the European Union as a whole and in this Parliament in particular.	1.395393512302967
Members of this House will have differing views, even within the same political parties, depending on (a) which country they come from or (b) which committee they sit on.	1.1765630349001541
There are areas of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the members of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries.	1.3672098278715161
As a lack of coherence, one can cite as Mrs Sandbæk did, the exporting of milk products to Jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the Jamaican dairy industry.	0.9963132904207921
We have beef exported to southern Africa, to Namibia and South Africa, which then sell their indigenous beef to Swaziland, so that Swaziland can fill its export quota back to the European Union.	1.1233936820762116
Remember too, some countries blocked an agreement with South African trade for four years.	1.1918451583746328
If we simply import raw materials from these developing countries, rather than allowing them the add-on value of producing their finished articles in their own country, we deny them the very poverty-eradication that we have set as our top principle in helping developing nations.	1.1842764435245228
I am not surprised the Commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development.	1.3241551978355357
There is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment.	1.21655831862352
I wish the Commission well in its task of producing that basic document.	0.8634945654385098
Mr President, this morning' s debate is very important.	1.5093489791306451
I therefore thank the Commission and the Council for having made a statement on the coherence of Community policies in relation to development, because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective.	1.3595361426843497
However, if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy, we will end up totally frustrated and, furthermore, the result will be negative.	1.4314515872658733
As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics, it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out.	1.168530455470161
The result of this absurd game is not zero, but rather a minus number, as a consequence of the material, financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise.	1.28979983090432
With regard to policy, this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another.	1.1710664124377659
In today' s globalised world, this fact is all the more obvious.	1.2237538516436355
There are no boundaries for Community policies.	0.9272527895246223
I am therefore glad that the Commission and the Council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of Community policies, and that, together with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the services of the Commission, they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union.	1.3843633853243806
Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state, in their respective working programmes, that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries, but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence.	1.507109307919059
Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied.	1.1240606949603966
For example, the Commission, in its long term guidelines, says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity, supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account.	1.259669335461397
The Commission is addressing a very important area, that is, commercial policy.	1.2679945195181197
However, this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development, agriculture, fisheries policy, immigration, our position in international financial institutions, the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform.	1.3583704501748655
The Council - and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time, it is true, being in November 1999, and also on other occasions, such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results.	1.4317108872519684
Since the Development Council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say, as some previous speakers have pointed out.	1.587559931565929
However, as Parliament, we wish to propose - as others have said and as the resolution states - the creation of an inter-service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different Community policies, which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves.	1.5265136095718295
What we really want, however, is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination, complementarity and, the most complex one, which we are discussing at the moment, coherence, will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union.	1.483221765488335
Let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the Intergovernmental Conference, the reform of the Commission - which will also affect the development services -, this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement, to perfect a more coherent political union.	1.4971582745137033
We therefore hope that the Commission, in the report it is going to present to us on global policy, will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of Community resources and the specific management of public interests.	1.4763327870158387
Mr President, I too should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their reports and, in common with others, express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence.	1.32718512585009
But we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is.	1.0564034974114191
I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of, in my view, useful figures.	1.0993641786927988
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, real per capita income in the world' s richest countries was three times higher than in the poorest countries. In 1900 it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher.	1.2318607140848863
And there is no sign of this trend' s being reversed.	1.1834955920904984
On the contrary, it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further. This is shown by the following figures: the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30:1 in 1960, 60:1 in 1990 and 74:1 in 1997.	1.1236918799385556
These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off.	0.8380598729088099
In other words, there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries, including the EU countries, are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale.	1.339964034941146
In a global village, major discrepancies in the world will not, in the longer term, be tolerated by the poorest section of the village.	1.3019429380839829
At some time or another, there will be a revolt, and it will be fully justified.	1.4053998886475578
I would therefore urge the Council' s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and, above all, to conclude it in such a way that we all of us, including the people of Europe, realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide.	1.4073005440595299
The EU on average is far from providing the pledged 0.7%.	0.8173356674487143
It may well be that others are worse, but that does not place us in any better a light.	1.1465374461028162
Above all, however, we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us.	1.3457225117267302
As far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word "trade" at all.	1.325196666533412
I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States. I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up, not only in the Commission but also in the Member States.	1.4869479775881818
I should also like to say that, in my view, what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from, respectively, the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development. In that way, we should perhaps have a basis for discussion, instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission, which is scarcely likely to produce results.	1.447408800564171
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution.	1.172557197925464
As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels, we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications.	1.316068189353106
Let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries.	1.1927577914968375
This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and, in this connection, the EU can set the agenda, leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities.	1.3399577615887193
Mr President, "The EU' s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired" .	1.352812470317737
This is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week, commenting on the Union' s development policy.	0.9148580110060883
This is not new.	1.0394094988672657
Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation, its effectiveness and quality have been called into question.	1.1425132005839047
Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror.	0.9361299372261284
Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally?	0.9405984379483185
One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy' s internal conflict.	1.4108960450178483
In terms of trade and agriculture, in particular, the European policy is in conflict with the development policy.	1.490952443845309
We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries.	1.1157252155158597
This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation.	1.0675077442520688
We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations, but as a policy in its own right.	1.2922180968591908
I advocate transparent, joint and efficient development policy.	0.7506432124838267
As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money, it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States.	1.2274955498022244
Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible, so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way.	1.339157240648975
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense.	1.411969728599395
As various Members have already commented, we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies, whose objectives run counter to development in those countries.	1.3118993424032366
And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and industry.	1.3521875568278576
We are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies.	1.4460271344404403
So there is a whole raft of contradictions.	0.9408186892525846
In my opinion, these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies. They are, if anything, more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States.	1.4333207591584003
We have to be aware of this.	1.1477739514653513
We often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world, as was recently the case with Indonesia, when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment.	1.1803827220384797
For me, these are the most serious contradictions in all this, more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies.	1.2700091523730965
We obviously know that, even within any one country, there are always contradictions between various policies.	1.3734033678506643
That is a fact of life.	1.3869308362958679
And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies, in this case development policy.	1.5257174699857938
We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them. The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one.	1.350146291516213
I believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between Community policies and development and cooperation policy, and that this monitoring centre' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to Community policies, but should also cover Member States' actions and policies, including the actions of economic groups, which I think are also important.	1.5045857122994197
This monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction.	1.0356527531970843
I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House.	1.2531450223452187
Our objective of minimising contradictions between development and cooperation policy and other policies has to be a valid objective, not merely within the European Union, but also at world level, given the increasing globalisation of the economy.	1.4250027335836277
If we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next WTO round of multilateral negotiations, because it would be contradictory if the European Union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself, only for the United States and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint.	1.4079774975466033
That is why I consider it to be essential - and fair - for these principles to be established at the next WTO round.	1.6267471321661575
Mr President, the Director-General of the DG for Development has said that to produce a report on coherence of EU policies with development policies, before this spring' s paper on development policy itself, is like putting the cart before the horse.	1.2798866189315592
Never mind that the Commission' s requirement to produce an annual report, set out clearly in the Council resolution, has produced only one "non-paper" , the real problem here is that at the time of rising world poverty this particular horse is climbing uphill and the cart of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being pulled slowly backwards.	1.3375850965208975
Time after time development policy is forgotten or is an afterthought when the major policies of this European Union are considered.	1.1984679975912718
Take the new chocolate directive, which shows that EU countries spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid.	1.0859178453538612
There has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries, 90% of which are our ACP partners, estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15%.	1.159575775483346
Take the fishing agreements, where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the EU waters.	1.1379988594475434
We are, at the same time, negotiating joint ventures allowing increased access for Europe' s large-scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small-scale fish workers in those countries world-wide.	0.9077691454495879
Take the trade agreements.	0.5379639450820979
As Mr Nielson said this morning with regard to Lomé, preferential access is only for "essentially all the products of the least-developed countries" .	1.0636358713900638
In other words, when EU commercial interests are concerned, poverty considerations go out of the window.	1.2504221410524814
In the stance that we took at Seattle, why such a silence on the EU' s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the GATT, including for the crucial textile sector?	1.205354380966897
On the common agricultural policy, the biggest culprit - no development impact assessment of the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms.	1.3460964086791591
Everyone now knows of the scandal of the export refund scheme which dumped 54 000 tonnes of excess subsidised beef on West African markets, slashing prices for local cattle farmers by half.	0.8531441244362473
Today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes.	0.633811206672459
Who will be next, quite literally, for the chop?	1.5011934867747032
I welcome Mr Amadeus' statement this morning, which acknowledged the difficulties of non-budgetisation of the EDF, which called for a more active role for the Development Council and which called for development priorities to be central to the EU' s emerging common foreign and security policy.	1.1691147570798177
I welcome too the Council declaration of 1992, its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the Treaty of European Union.	1.3163743082368489
Action simply has not been taken.	0.8612064126954387
That is why we want annual reports, we want an annual inter-service group and we want a complaints procedure, to make sure action is actually taken.	1.6727433538691276
I ask Mr Nielson, in his summing-up, to directly address those points in the resolution.	1.2911499012912684
Mr President, I would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture.	1.0549238176568223
Over the past couple of years, a considerable share of the funds has been channelled towards the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in the developing countries and, more especially, the Lomé countries.	1.2176477811206532
The results are certainly not what we expected.	0.9902930216815177
What could be the cause of this?	0.839662251590589
I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries, barring a few exceptions.	1.242585825090685
I think that the Commission could do a great deal there to help this develop.	1.4398894296521327
No farmer, anywhere in the world, will produce something if prices are too low.	1.0992955760233718
The governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma: whom should they support, the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food?	1.2041668523761815
This fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the Commission, and not by the Commission on its own. In most countries where the Commission is active, development aid is also granted by the Member States themselves.	1.6631671525276344
It should not be the case that the policy of the Member States contravenes that of the Commission.	1.181327701358688
It is up to the Commission' s delegations in the developing countries to assume a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all countries follow this line of approach.	1.2345641652866413
Special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production.	1.1970621043170613
Far too often, artificial fertiliser, veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge.	0.865919813348655
Once the project comes to an end after five years, the policy of free gifts also ends.	1.2543383013644605
I think, therefore, that the cost element should be built in right from the outset in the policy of all projects, and as far as I know, this is not the case by any stretch of the imagination.	1.437487511303107
Finally, I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use.	1.3405130996177237
Every year, I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund, that they are far behind in spending the funds.	1.515810436593958
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted, which is a pity.	1.158573638080286
We should really talk about coherence in the development policy in the presence of Mr Prodi, for example, who has missed a great chance right from the outset, for he has allowed the development cooperation policy to fragment over three Commissioners - and this is better than four, I have to admit - but this does not really make for a coherent policy.	1.442461634852133
We also note that, as before, there are still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments.	1.2207777910365893
The President-in-Office of the Council came up with a good suggestion, namely to budget the European Development Fund.	1.0942057236442984
Parliament would, of course, welcome this with open arms. If this were possible, it would be a huge, historic victory.	1.325664253562688
Since Amsterdam, three terms have taken centre stage: complementarity, coordination and cohesion.	1.0587158913721986
I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields.	1.286494872596114
If a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion, if a request is made at all, then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult, unless one simply admits that there is no cohesion at all.	1.3666403086990722
I would prefer it if a report were to be written on the present lack of cohesion, and if a systematic strategy were to be developed to reach a certain level of cohesion, for it is a long way off yet.	1.4012002294326094
One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council.	0.6789179411392987
He stated: "Contradictions in policy can lead to balance."	0.9581440638164561
It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand, and vice versa.	1.2202150215815057
But this leads to status-quo and self-deceit, and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes, indeed, but changes which have only made poverty worse.	1.1922998945633903
This is supposed to be our priority, would you believe.	1.0575159112441197
I know that we do a great deal of good, but let us start with this very essential aspect.	1.5833831061430623
Mr President, we have already noted that there is no report from the Commission, but I intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the Council presented in its 1997 opinion.	1.5794246833767531
The first is concerned with conflict resolution.	1.2663933714065665
For many years, I have tried, through the Council and the Commission, to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in, and working for, conflict resolution in the Western Sahara, which is occupied by Morocco.	1.5474129135693726
The UN has a peace plan.	0.817893019705641
We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end.	0.8764585360573286
I also want to take up the subject of migration.	1.0841377230936857
I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries, which might make it easier to expel immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds.	1.1834237859677499
I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms.	1.032517730498505
We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds.	1.0888791855277848
Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age.	0.8076929439195011
This is not because of a lack of food, but because of what we have talked a lot about today, namely increasing poverty.	1.4611711151976718
Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests.	0.8734944285144434
I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply, specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason.	1.1643690872288974
I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce.	1.4868994159844902
Women appear to be completely absent from all areas, especially development policy when, of course, we are not in reality absent at all.	1.2333003304177448
Mr President, the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid.	1.1028580280238458
The level of aid is naturally important, and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased.	1.3952497938157349
This ought to be done with, in particular, a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity.	1.4314648949424866
However, the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries.	1.2313020257939513
A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed.	1.1364140604130903
The latter include trade, agricultural and fisheries policies.	0.8783159750888032
Other important areas are, of course, the flow of private investments, cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with, and finances solutions to, a variety of global problems which affect us all.	1.2427691810506456
These problems include questions of climate, health issues, biodiversity etc, and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation, that is to say the new economy which is developing.	1.3275618829410052
In this economy, the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked.	1.1566542229194277
In my opinion, what we are discussing here today is partly the EU' s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance.	1.3630926756661468
The report, or survey, which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded, showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be, is naturally quite crucial.	1.2976676959097369
I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more.	1.1206730541887102
The Commission is new and has to be given time, but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the Commission.	1.5469111863470213
I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the Commission.	1.2228202736321023
In addition to a report of this kind, I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character.	1.3249688239006627
An analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries. These include technology, trade, cooperation in the field of research etc.	1.2439232883460687
It should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting.	1.4747102771056935
Finally, Parliament recommends, in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution, that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence.	1.7688574839877578
I believe it is only a coincidence, but the Commissioner for the Environment is also, of course, to participate in this group.	1.589591768505232
Let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed.	1.7288234464731018
Policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other.	1.1538493801111702
There are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest.	1.0056909896612318
Mr President, the Seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less- and least-developed countries, it is purely a rich country selfish interest.	1.3233905753340667
Yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent.	0.9310788096318686
There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs, allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain.	0.9833187145406902
It did not work; poverty became worse than ever.	0.8675407792005477
The medicine may not taste too good in the short term, but opening one' s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term.	1.1418559960524775
Is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular?	1.3517466302796908
As Mr Nielson said, this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity.	1.2945538685557847
Yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough.	1.006663734118512
We also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries. Parliament' s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU.	1.1702000977542493
Eliminating all remaining barriers to imports, tariff barriers and quotas and, just as important, non-tariff barriers, such as Mrs Maij-Weggen mentioned in her speech - eliminating these barriers would do more than any amount of development aid to secure for developing countries the economic progress which both we and they desire.	1.167385334906107
It is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminishes our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for Europe and our fine words.	1.0893795353274993
Mr President, in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence, coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the Community and of the Member States.	1.5255895004022488
There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union' s ability to match words with action.	1.198579930880757
I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti-personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes, to post-conflict reconstruction, and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world, particularly in developing countries.	1.3100469546927132
Over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance, assistance to victims and related activities.	1.0589463744296754
The Member States have spent similar amounts.	1.264567804019951
But there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span.	1.1960493567752373
Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States.	1.0216050278336055
This has been talked about for years.	0.8183456391976309
The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes, strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions, ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell.	0.8729663994687852
It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes.	1.1161495497496021
A proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines.	1.083246740831594
It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational, procedural, financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union.	1.2181787478311072
Are these afflictions of the past, or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations?	1.4061595211149585
Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence.	1.6665521046501572
And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously, and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent, rather, we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect.	1.340288313369077
For these are prerequisite to any development.	0.7953050323002453
If these criteria are not adhered to, then development does not stand a chance	0.9915950889142647
The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow.	1.0906597259504505
I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba.	1.4984084637406856
After all, we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International.	1.0486583992631577
It may well be that you, having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships, view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber, and that you have problems where good governance is concerned.	1.3693738643901066
Nonetheless, these are important criteria for the European Union.	1.214528449110536
There is a second issue I would like to raise.	1.3006030128530064
We are discussing coherence here.	1.026763611721154
Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent.	1.16729638047471
In my view, however, the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too.	1.3754660810906942
There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another.	1.44674181498096
Nor is there coherence vis-à-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union' s budget but the EDF remains outside it.	1.1255347993440263
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13.5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control, and to bodies such as OLAF, then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability.	1.1286873931805084
This, to my mind, is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do, i.e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union.	1.3427433360726282
Mr President, we certainly must concede that, on balance, this text is full of good intentions, but we did not vote in favour of it in committee, nor shall we do so in plenary. We had two reasons for this, both of which gave rise to amendments which I should like to explain here very briefly.	1.6309387453762472
First, the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF; clearly that is misguided.	1.2390547236418792
In our view, cooperation is, and should remain, an intergovernmental exercise.	1.57218749005136
With Europe preparing to enlarge, communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget, quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy.	1.1081321009336762
Lastly, the Commission has, in the recent past, had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid transparently, as Mrs Maes has just reminded us so opportunely.	1.5203918230056848
Why should we add to them?	0.7681159336631124
Secondly, we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie' s report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because, in the final analysis, this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission is taking ever more frequent recourse.	1.3594056284125364
It is perfectly astounding that the Union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank.	1.4409369926136735
And let me say in passing, it is even more astonishing that the Council allowed it to.	1.2854828931987488
As a result, we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed.	1.379181104587749
The part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the Union ends up paying producers to stop producing sherry, port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law. Imagine the potential cost of such a precedent.	1.1975109684324472
It is proof, as if we still needed it, of the fact that immature diplomacy, which defends no interests, unless of course they are individual interests, and is caught between the dogma of free trade and pressure groups and more or less friendly NGOs, is not just inefficient, it is positively dangerous.	1.441809052975163
Finally, a word on the general thinking behind the Corrie report.	1.3272056933991963
Nowadays, let us face it, the Joint Assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatisers in Geneva and Washington.	1.1990864964715675
It was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened.	1.0870338316656714
The Corrie report missed this chance and we must, regrettably, punish it for losing so much.	0.8359373984786946
. (PT) Mr President, by way of both a conclusion and a summary, I would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate.	1.188000929143857
First of all, many speakers stressed that globalisation accentuates regional imbalances and social inequality, and increases poverty.	1.150933106899308
This suggests that something must be done, failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or worsen.	0.959150944481397
Secondly, it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context, taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality.	1.2465366246807517
I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union' s role in international development policies is significant.	1.222161881552341
Everyone recognises, indeed this was the theme of today' s debate, that, if the European Union is to play a more active and leading role in development policies at world level, it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development-related policies. I note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in EU policies is not a matter for the Council, for the Commission or for Parliament alone.	1.541127303917754
Quite the contrary - it will have to be the subject of a concerted effort in terms of discussion and legislative and institutional preparation, be it on the part of the Commission or of the Council, or even on the part of the European Parliament itself, and some Members have in fact already suggested that a monitoring centre or a working party could be established to monitor the impact of various policies in the specific area of development.	1.4083049054260237
Finally, I would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency' s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union' s policies, and in particular in the context of its foreign policy.	1.4429886679538064
We believe that this is absolutely vital, failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies, and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning Europe' s status in the international system.	1.3078238684153993
For this reason it may be necessary, as I have stressed, to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies.	1.3045090788443978
In this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention, which succeeds the Lomé Convention, is an important instrument of renewal, and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process, as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle.	1.4888236187656598
. I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate.	1.177537551594038
I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion.	1.2990968123282605
We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence.	0.9223749192717899
This discussion is not new.	0.5056614815068933
We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it, as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence.	1.6022391268712626
I have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda.	1.422973615701641
This also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the Commission system which may very well include, as suggested by some of the political groups in Parliament, the setting up of a special intra-service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission.	1.2836052768126265
I have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything.	1.3831735176724036
I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist, and we certainly do have them.	1.2703848433361575
Much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every Member State, as has been very honestly said here in this House: people more or less identify with their spheres of interest, and all this is legitimate.	1.3248004353933647
I would, however, warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system.	1.0507513646587745
This exists, but it is only a small part of what we are discussing.	1.3043976389931085
The major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on, and this is the problem.	1.3074823216965872
Mr Mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low.	0.9917111193325973
This is true in our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective.	1.2692563808919173
They farm, not just for a living, but in order to live, and this makes a difference.	1.7072591509087356
Subsistence farming is not based on price calculations, it is based on the hope of rain in the next season.	1.2356314193765636
This does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty-focusing which we need to deliver better than so far.	1.1213084359419074
From that perspective, what I am saying here is of deep relevance.	1.236886116779665
Other issues have been mentioned: cattle-farming in Namibia, tomatoes and milk powder in the Caribbean.	0.9093430620019077
We should not be too masochistic.	0.933396053903647
There is a limit to how useful that is.	1.0234935869355586
All these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of.	1.1150095666819928
The intervention prices have been regulated, and the problems we had with beef in Western Africa and in Namibia were actually solved by reducing the intervention support.	1.190147413338718
These are real problems, but they have all been dealt with.	1.276039685783392
As regards the issue of cacao, chocolate: I repeat that the 5% has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries.	1.240067950041572
What we are talking about here are the local nuts which are as important to the people collecting them and making a living out of them in Burkina Faso as coconuts for farmers in Ghana.	1.1863543620817845
This is not a clear case of incoherence, it is more a case of a competition between suppliers.	1.5509374635992395
What was mentioned concerning sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated.	0.993473203121385
In the Overseas Countries and Territories Framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem, but it may be that what we are talking about here has more to do with promoting the interests of some European companies than with generating income in the Caribbean. In any case, this is a matter which we are currently dealing with.	1.3438721642809872
I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa.	1.3507494938405242
In all modesty, I would claim that this is something that documents that the Commission is willing to walk or fly the extra mile in order to ensure coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of trade interests.	1.354960159997182
We certainly have done our share to solve that problem, and I sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement.	1.3394253483031842
Finally, I thank you again for this debate.	1.5049436059111385
We will come back again with material on these issues, because these problems, in one way or another, are here to stay, simply because development cooperation represents basically doing something in the world that is different from taking care of traditionally-defined trade interests, etc. We have to reconcile those different approaches.	1.3650912516894618
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.	0.920242417336676
I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	0.9149227959933235
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	0.29695966651602207
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission	0.36602131691075035
The next item is the statement by the Council on EU priorities for the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission on 20 March 2000.	1.1503973189573755
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union played an active role in the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held in Geneva in March and April 1999.	1.0952207175514777
It tabled resolutions on the human rights situation in Iran, Iraq, in the Israeli settlements, in Burma/Myanmar, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Sudan, and negotiated statements to be issued on behalf of the chairman on Colombia and on East Timor.	1.3296756994200325
For the first time, the European Union tabled a resolution on the death penalty, which was enormously successful, and led work on a resolution concerning children' s rights, which was a joint initiative with the Latin American group of countries.	1.3760305608857726
The Union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission to be held in Geneva in March and April.	1.0939235807009036
In particular, as agreed at the Human Rights Council Group on 9 February 2000, the European Union intends to table draft resolutions on the Israeli settlements, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burma/Myanmar, a draft chairman' s statement on Colombia, and, possibly, on East Timor, together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries.	1.34161648416078
The European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March.	1.1565024949929439
In particular, there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty.	1.094787333594349
To date, the group has not reached agreement on the strategy to be adopted in this respect, and in particular with regard to formulating a compromise to be tabled in the last resort in case of any amendments to the contrary, including Article 2(7) of the Charter of the United Nations, which refers to sovereignty.	1.4918864882603509
We have tried to reach agreement in advance on a compromise text, in view of the difficulties that arose at the 1999 session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, at which the Member States failed to agree on an amendment introducing a reference to Article 2(7) into the draft resolution sponsored by the European Union on the death penalty.	1.3446534918689692
As you know, at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year, the United States decided, at a very late stage, to table a draft resolution on China.	1.3926268200481584
This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no-action motion.	0.7469715150583771
The European Union voted against that motion.	1.2212125036340307
The European Union' s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China, but an EU vote against the no-action motion.	1.2638960280050073
It is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote.	1.1806008297853072
The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution.	1.2187514321786386
This initiative has provoked a strong reaction on China' s part: the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union, in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States' initiative.	1.2679876346986771
This initiative is being discussed within the Union, but with no hope of a decision in the near future.	1.3607910144709525
It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible, and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000.	1.3867893781208969
In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission, we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close.	1.323557053034286
It is therefore important this year, too, that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution.	1.4786539862571157
In this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.	1.3197081860761977
The European Union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party, the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground, and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission, potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing.	1.5190510190963944
The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues, and whether or not it agrees with this initiative, this is in any case legitimate from this point of view.	1.3995529994322735
The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon, and will include seminars on legal issues and on women' s rights, and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part.	1.2334670423087906
The next human rights seminar will be organised by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000, and, during the last round of the dialogue in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the European Union' s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the United Nations International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the United Nations' International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, both of which have been signed by the Chinese Government.	1.384602236454417
The European Union is discussing issues on which it hopes that China will take concrete measures, and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union hopes China will announce positive measures at the session on 25 February.	1.3177318323999825
The presidency will also present to the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern.	1.0896724450014184
The meeting held in Beijing in October 1999 confirmed that, on the one hand, the Chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues relating to the dialogue itself, with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal forms of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention. On the other hand, they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity.	1.2958709830987662
Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue, while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage.	1.2987131602788204
On various occasions the European Union has reiterated to the Chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue, and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas.	1.3636823762904775
It was decided that the dialogue should continue, but in a more targeted and effective way, given that China has agreed with the European Union' s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars.	1.3894400340961472
Lastly, during the next Human Rights Commission there will also be a debate on rationalising the work of the Commission itself.	1.444621270904696
A working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission' s mechanisms. This working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous, especially in the financial field.	1.4142453200664866
The European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission' s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level.	1.3032955136213442
. Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for Geneva on subjects like racism, civil and political rights and the right to development.	1.17471619450202
As the presidency said, much remains to be done, despite the understandable request by Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should set out its position well in advance of the Geneva session.	1.3306357638776982
That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues.	1.2220394875099998
For example, discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases.	1.3180613842209334
It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult.	1.6735567042912092
That does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference.	1.2036401462749877
However, let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues: the death penalty, Cuba and China.	1.271510555655233
I am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks.	1.046950933500325
We are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission.	1.029752116237416
This has always been a subject about which I personally have felt extremely strongly, I have always voted against the death penalty.	1.2469834238282829
Spurred on by Amnesty International and others, one of the first decisions I took as Governor of Hong Kong was to abolish the death penalty.	0.9489503926086632
We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly.	1.000280007796228
We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid.	1.0476672508571019
The New York stage is different from Geneva.	0.7487244266350768
Last year' s debate in New York on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues.	1.017443623918022
It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty.	0.7016420003877296
The debate in Geneva, however, is more focused on human rights issues.	1.27866848784423
We may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there.	0.8805146585964722
Secondly, Cuba.	1.5447190702462597
I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously.	1.1536754875464361
We are extremely concerned about moves by the Cuban Government over the last year that have further curtailed public freedom, moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty.	1.0921081197872824
We are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions.	1.0793990974129306
We are monitoring the human rights situation through the reports of NGOs and the work of our human rights working group based in the EU embassies in Havana.	1.242017965994923
We have regularly put our criticisms to the Cuban authorities, and this Parliament has done the same.	1.2956380675207957
But I do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate Cuba.	1.236820309971732
We want a fair and open society in Cuba, a Cuba which respects the principles of the market, the sanctity of contract and the rule of law.	1.1772101898585572
We want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	0.9274338795640085
My views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which I wish to deal, namely China.	1.326199431397068
Quite simply, I want us to be engaged with China.	1.3534105156774527
It would be self-indulgent and self-defeating, as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity, to want anything else.	1.0638127354451912
I also want to see a China transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy activists or religious believers.	0.9363645853847616
So what should we do?	0.7871525491823164
Naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms.	1.0640567509432624
It is a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which does not include China - or Russia, for that matter.	1.5202856430872407
But I do not believe today, nor have I ever believed, that our burgeoning economic relationship with China - manifested, for example, by China' s EUR 25 billion surplus with the European Union - should silence us when it comes to China' s human rights record.	1.384582477729422
For me the question is not whether we should address the question of human rights in China - we have a duty to do so and a legitimate interest in doing so - but rather what is the most effective way of doing this?	1.5600602399413364
So what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year?	0.9700790416043525
As the presidency has noted, the Union as a whole is considering its position.	1.3740970864320812
But I strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the Member States ought to take proper account.	1.0335216028212575
First, while some people question whether tabling a Geneva resolution makes any difference, several of the most distinguished Chinese advocates of democracy strongly believe that it is a valuable move, not least because of the message it sends to people in China itself.	1.3164888842266382
That is a point that deserves serious consideration.	1.0998007782354389
Secondly, we will all want to take proper account of what has actually been happening in China in recent months, for instance, the heavy sentences imposed on democracy campaigners, the detention and recent punishments meted out to members of Christian churches and the arrests and sentences of the members of Falun Gong.	1.2877216419640412
Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet.	1.2346809603933626
We have made our views very clear to them.	1.0229332085354186
While we all know that for many people in China there has been a real long-term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties, there is a dark side to the picture as well.	1.310967317537968
Critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with China.	1.2131291128572008
That is true and potentially valuable, although I have to say - and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked.	1.5326797816174988
Of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres.	1.2049040178777821
That is very welcome and I also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level.	1.122636388731703
Naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long-term process, but I wish I could point to more real gains.	1.3832080651472893
The next dialogue in Lisbon on 25 February will be an important test.	0.9978793721963605
It will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not.	0.8835555662635332
What, finally, do we want to see as the first steps?	1.5715584825245772
Well, for example, we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them.	1.21417765003722
I wish we were closer to that.	0.6653693017838748
Where does all that leave us this year?	0.7114191957021507
I repeat that Member States will have to make up their minds.	1.2057713824612262
What I hope is, first, that we in Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it, that we will not allow some to be picked off, that our position will not be based on self-delusion or pretence, that it will be a common position and a sensible position.	1.589559598756169
I know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions.	1.2009134394562955
But if that is true, then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward.	1.4010877173652527
If we are to rest our position on the human rights dialogue, then we need to be able to convince you, the NGO community and the public at large that it is actually getting somewhere.	1.4184174936132454
That, in my judgement, is the challenge for the next few weeks.	1.65539401862214
I am grateful to the House for its concern about human rights around the world, and particularly in China.	1.1849099157080565
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	0.618741388554918
We will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission and proceed to the vote.	1.0631800001009994

. As Mrs Wallström explained during yesterday's debate, the Commission is able to accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13.	1.034953874448101
The Commission can also accept Amendment No 4 in principle.	1.1668678979146414

Recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Ms Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the proposal for a Council decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (11221/1999 - COM(1998) 249 - C5 - 0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC))	0.9378779290087607

Before the final vote:	0.7348281323712066
. (DE) Mr President, following this vote, I would like to ask the competent Commissioner, Mr Byrne, if, now that he has seen how much support there is in this Chamber, he is prepared to adopt the proposed amendments?	1.5017566057927063
. I regret to say that I believe that the thought-out position I advanced yesterday is the correct position.	1.4438340528748816
The comprehensive approach that the Commission intends to adopt on this issue will be brought forward as soon as possible under Article 152 where Parliament will have a codecision function.	1.3223457872546118
That is the appropriate way of dealing with this.	1.1559421846663809
Mr President, in accordance with Article 69 (2), I call for referral back to committee.	1.1993003486272749
The reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure, as proposed by the Commission.	1.2076976310665548
We have accepted this but have proposed further approximations of the legal effect measures that affect this directive, in particular the adoption of a text - which has been approved by the Commission overall - for the use and labelling of genetically modified organisms.	1.4617852257088828
We take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time, but the Commission will not adopt this.	1.470183667220464
I believe that, in accordance with Article 69 (2), we must endeavour to enter into discussion with the Commission, and I would therefore urge my fellow MEPs to decide in favour of referral back to committee.	1.300950956891096

Before the vote:	0.5613656424947105
Mr President, permit me to say quite publicly to Mrs Stenzel, who is a member of the ÖVP executive, that many MEPs are horrified that you have entered into a coalition with Haider, and that we wish to denounce you for doing so!	1.3925131993612256

. (DE) Mr Cohn-Bendit, I do not think that the European Parliament has any business intervening to such a huge extent in a country' s domestic politics, in the way that you are doing.	1.416939507114674
I can speak for my party, which championed Austria' s membership of the European Union in the early days.	1.2236313314349452
As a political force, we serve to guarantee that Austria will continue to embrace European values.	1.2350293529343765
I refuse to allow myself to be ostracised for internal and party political reasons!	0.9017807286542852

This is perhaps an appropriate moment to welcome to the official gallery, a delegation of four members of the Moroccan parliament, led by Mr Brahim Rachidi, Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Representatives.	1.2335213033883183
We are honoured by the visit of this delegation which is taking place shortly before the entry into force on 1 March 2000 of the Association Agreement between Morocco and the European Union.	1.0506922855370588
On this historic occasion we welcome these developments in our relations and the prospects for closer ties between our two parliaments.	0.9427184305607242
It is in this spirit that the delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries will be visiting Morocco on 20 to 22 March.	0.8914089381252257
I hope the delegation has an excellent visit to Strasbourg.	1.0773874993569093
(Loud applause)	0.04062958545577951

In particular, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 6, 16, 21, 28, 31, 33, 34, 44, 45, 46, 48, 52, 53, 65, 67, 68, 75, 76, 78, 80, 84, 85, 88 and 102.	0.962955831045974

The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 30, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 50, 55, 56, 57, 58, 63, 69, 73, 79, 86, 89, 96, 99, 106 and 108.	0.8433082128778385

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000)	0.932569005217671
. (FR) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE.	1.3126868278583788
I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries, whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean, countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries.	1.1257873978509656
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have, for the most part, been retained in the common position adopted by the Council.	1.073531502445759
As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%).	1.2724910437980201
In my opinion, the most important amendments concern the following:	1.0761721013465217
LIFE' s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment, particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies, as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment;	1.400677993517981
Improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE, procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public, and procedures for cooperation between recipients;	1.1122287608386998
The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere;	1.348017465155951
The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation.	1.2611645314233844
I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe.	0.8927119322416653
The other candidate countries (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries.	1.0636355594451778
The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004).	1.1347894468971405
The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million.	1.1812544384580603
I support Mrs Lienemann' s firm stance.	0.8387639957271422
The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created, even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement.	1.3335637586442808
If the report is adopted in plenary session, then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme.	1.3210260748961502
This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions!	0.9712454805358536
Böge report (A5-0023/2000)	0.5790797719469467
. (FR) As an MEP and, more importantly, as a consumer, I welcome the European Commission' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union.	1.3814958784231934
This proposal has two objectives: first, to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and, secondly, to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species.	1.1753814546366754
What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie.	1.2094128330273488
What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis.	1.2560223746751027
I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs.	1.3129574632963896
These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie.	1.0631277084815949
A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic.	0.8705081892769246
Even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective, especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie, it is still a notable improvement.	1.3367960698065746
It is a pledge to European citizens, who have voiced their concern, as regards European food policy, on many occasions.	1.648683952191311
The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard.	1.3975191579965431
As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution, traceability, responsibility and transparency, the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety.	1.2682184472738554
This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence.	1.2810012533772945
It is up to us, as responsible Europeans, to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive.	1.2676352371705244
Cederschiöld report (A5-0008/2000)	0.48712515156901104
Mr President, I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament.	1.319031236555302
In my view, products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products, namely, those that can be seen and touched.	1.1692539068261454
The fruits of the intellect and science, which are intangible, are of inestimable importance. Therefore, the European Community should be more energetic in providing practical encouragement, not just through upholding patents but through concessions and other forms of support for scientists who are striving, through the knowledge and experience they have acquired, to give future generations something better than that which they have today.	1.3658664323911025
. (DA) We oppose, on principle, the European Community' s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the Member States.	1.4235598536371024
We are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the Member States and the Community. At the same time, we appreciate the fact that the WIPO treaties are a significant step forward in the direction of guaranteeing the rights of distributors and practising artists.	1.294087917923877
We are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation.	1.3273669669806922
- (DE) The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because, in the plenary debate of the previous day, Commissioner Bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding EU accession to the WIPO Treaties.	1.3317818246770134
In institutional terms, there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties.	1.1570633386690738
In addition, there is a clear tendency, in matters of international jurisdiction, more and more often to obtain a pure EU jurisdiction.	1.3858278681915723
When it is, then, still not clear to what extent the EP can participate in the decision-making processes, the question of legitimacy arises.	1.2933031898355754
Moreover, the concept of 'author' is not defined in the Treaties.	1.0789388206984578
In this regard, too, the Commission has not answered the question as to what definition it wishes to base its discussions on, and whether it wishes to settle foreseeable conflicts by imposing its own definition of the law on others.	1.2014618784084792
One of the trickiest aspects is the public interest: will ratifying and applying WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture?	1.0666619082611515
And, finally, the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarified. Regarding this, too, there has been only silence by way of a response from the Commission.	1.1986325834497689
If nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation, then we must at least abstain from voting.	1.0674171818802052
Graefe zu Baringdorf (A5-0015/2000)	0.9144895294220248
. (PT) Food safety issues are in the spotlight following the BSE and dioxin scandals.	1.173857839118467
GMOs are still the subject of great uncertainty, both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health.	1.1268859812785355
The precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty.	0.955251584203563
The use of biotechnology needs to be studied in greater depth and not just "packaged" for immediate sale to boost the profits of a few multinationals in this sector.	1.112458054656973
The profit motive is very much behind the present food safety crises.	0.9403731655555849
This is the context that the rapporteur finds himself working in, making a legal link between the issue of GMOs and feedingstuffs, and noting that the latter "shall be authorised only if ... safe for human health and the environment" .	1.3441579028568944
Furthermore, he considers that "genetically modified additives shall be clearly identified as such on any label or any document, official or otherwise, which is affixed to or accompanies the additive" .	1.2281699953249277
This will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer' s freedom of choice.	1.1005418396974016
In view of the Montreal Protocol on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), I welcome the fact that the rapporteur has included these issues in his report, and I have therefore voted in favour of it.	1.3660140234245994
Stenzel report (A5-0034/2000)	0.6786244731801083
Mr President, I would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote, on behalf of the PPE Group on the EQUAL report.	1.2853754865392
We have followed a nominal list which was identical to that which we had agreed upon beforehand with the Socialist Group.	1.034536944975381
The Socialist Group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been.	1.457505142853031
This is why we are abstaining.	1.065779721558443
We want to ensure that the EQUAL report, which is very important for refugees, the elderly, the handicapped and women, simply goes ahead.	1.4877784251615926
It is regrettable that, due to the procedure, the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session.	1.2578816505445474
I am convinced that the rapporteur' s nationality has played a certain role, which should not be of relevance in this Parliament.	1.2137370819385218
This is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament.	1.0986960047431065
These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report.	0.8407913275798349
We want EQUAL to go ahead.	0.6733954766726836
We assent to the main thrust of it, but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage.	1.3139458745383377
Mr President, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party in the European Parliament, I abstained in the vote on the EQUAL initiative because, although it provides more support than in the past for projects aimed at combating age discrimination, its proposals are not sufficiently trenchant or specific.	1.3653892632152926
I also abstained for another reason. I think the time has come for the European institutions to stop experimenting and trying to establish best practices for doing what we should do and begin to give European citizens some firm indication regarding what Europe wants Europe to be.	1.29475541752776
The time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice.	0.893456920759623
. (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for EU initiative programmes (CIP).	0.9121437449736555
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote is only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have simply adopted a position on the issue.	1.2497796179488418
We think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report.	1.2171055320866178
. (FR) We did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market.	1.2046280319031657
Nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague, all too pie in the sky.	1.231818406232565
And yet, in the chapter on aid and training for refugees, the report marks a step backwards from the initial text by stipulating that they no longer apply to refugees as such but to "refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Convention" .	1.1671540231674657
This restriction is inadmissible at a time when countless refugees throughout Europe are in a drastic situation, with no protection, forced to work on the black market, and to hide, while so-called democratic governments and state police forces hunt them down.	1.4335013756017259
The first thing we need to do in this area is to give these stateless people the legal means to live a decent life and be able to work without being relegated to the status of pariahs, the victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple forms of administrative and police harassment, the main form of which is having to live in permanent fear of expulsion.	1.3251163029815705
.	-0.0
I voted in favour of Mrs Stenzel' s report on the EQUAL initiative as I believe that it is essential to continue the work begun under the previous NOW, HORIZON, YOUTHSTART and INTEGRA strands of the ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT initiatives.	1.2016314375956079
The lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on.	0.979105716436008
EQUAL stands for "equality" .	0.6743970862049264
It must be seen to deliver.	1.166200223625357
I welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market.	0.9291032465916385
I also favour the desire to move away from an out-dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment.	0.9026594129926616
There must be flexibility.	0.7529412156005263
I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative.	0.92656058872332
In the last programming period 9% of Structural Funds were available for Community initiatives.	1.173909117035227
The figure is now 5.35%.	0.6907690447335639
This means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated.	1.0481521921802686
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee adopted several of the amendments I put forward, concerning for example, the emphasis on access to start-up capital, how to exploit new business opportunities in cities, towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business.	1.2573481239124304
This often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities.	0.7983349101682032
The positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process.	0.8948655696911734
I also stressed the need for prevention.	0.7609789148804942
The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted.	1.0546549564437615
There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority.	1.0261442734822885
There must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets.	0.948017173660684
While there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way, overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported.	1.4354508049336894

(PT) The Commission intends to use the Community initiative EQUAL to replace the Community EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT initiatives and various subprogrammes in these areas, such as NOW, on new opportunities for women, HORIZON, for disabled persons, YOUTHSTART, for promoting the labour market integration of young people, and INTEGRA, for groups threatened with exclusion. Unfortunately, this involves a significant reduction in appropriations.	1.4448237201881529
Accordingly, the Commission will use this initiative to develop what it considers to be new ways of fighting discrimination and inequality of all kinds in the labour market, based on the four pillars of the employment policy guidelines.	1.1825541561456157
This is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations.	1.3724430000518908
However, in order to give this new approach some chance of success, the Commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal, a more simple and direct one, involving the NGOs from the outset, so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way.	1.4701350110886948
The Commission did not do that.	0.7854594690762003
We hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned.	1.3989002357292621
Mr President, some of us in Parliament will remember the successful film, "Cocoon", in which some elderly people drank a special kind of water that made them young again.	1.4288439440947467
In my view, it is, therefore, immensely important to exercise extreme vigilance over the water we all drink and, consequently, to study and approve the provisions referred to here.	1.2070389397965093
For that reason, I approved these measures, but I should also like to express the hope that there will be particularly rigorous monitoring of water purity at the point where it enters our houses, to ensure that it is of the highest level.	1.3961874651925705
In the measures that have been adopted, I note that support for people who purify their water in their own homes has been omitted. I trust that this will be remedied in the future.	1.3903642713521263
Apart from Amendment No 76, which was an error, since I intended to vote in favour, the rest of my votes can be explained by means of the following fictional situation:	1.4490438571215356
Supposed draft environmental directive: "European Parliament and Council Directive establishing the obligation to maintain, during winter, a temperature of no less than eighteen degrees centigrade in the streets, squares and parks of the cities of Europe ".	1.2746299297253538
Guidelines of the Directive: a) each city shall provide the means, in terms of energy and technology, sufficient for this objective to be achieved by 2012; b) the full costs shall be passed on to the inhabitants of each city by means of electricity prices.	1.1667709352566116
Opinion of an MEP from the north of Europe: "This Directive would be unfair since, for example, the cost for an inhabitant of Stockholm would be two hundred times greater than the cost for an inhabitant of Naples ".	1.0589431937083933
Opinion of an MEP from the south of Europe: "Nevertheless, this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions".	1.2401002569667805
(End of fiction).	0.608780821803557
In explaining my vote, I must say that it is positive that there is a Community directive on water, but I believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of Europe, but will lead to legislative caricature.	1.4636537572292958
We cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts, such as the Mediterranean countries, and countries with northern levels of rainfall.	1.0836089962369388
Furthermore, it would show a lack of solidarity to make transfers of water, between different river basins, practically impossible in the future.	1.2670777741979422

In adopting the water directive on Wednesday 15 February, the European Parliament confirmed its wish to protect surface water, coastal wasters, inland waters and groundwater.	1.0546342978894028
Europe now has a framework which will allow it to prevent any deterioration in the quality of water, promote its sustainable use, protect eco-systems, help fight floods and droughts and eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.	1.0509360063551607
We have thrown water a life-belt.	0.7346226658597187
. (FR) It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy.	1.0716305701605624
The ecological disaster on the banks of the Danube is a reminder, as if we needed one, that all too often human negligence jeopardises natural resources such as water.	1.3146413512445583
The objective of this proposal for a directive, which dates back to 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water, coastal waters, inland waters and groundwater.	1.170902012035341
It provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration, protect ecosystems, promote sustainable water use, help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.	1.0255323391731328
Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework.	0.9203170376309459
The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy.	0.7979414959133085
The proposal for a directive was amended twice, first in 1997 and then in 1998.	1.3251484255044206
A technical working party made up of Council and Parliament representatives met in January 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions.	1.081136938774504
However, the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments, most of which I support.	1.3963984471242417
As far as the timetable and objectives are concerned, the Council' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive, while the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years.	1.1771327329667511
The committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020, the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020.	1.2805772791288774
The Council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years, but the Commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years.	1.215932087953303
All the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years, not 16.	1.1785185624803984
I must say that I support these reduced deadlines, especially as provision is made for derogations.	1.2020646233200036
As far as costs are concerned, I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources.	1.2852343792104997
I likewise expect the European Commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012.	1.2171437633377482
I will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, which needs no further comment: "Water is not a commercial product like any other but, rather, a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the European Union and which must be protected, defended and treated as such" .	1.2953875563307238
. I wish to put on the official record my concerns with the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote.	1.1162362622134923
We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water.	1.101760975385337
There is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur.	1.168646388323861
However, the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which, under the rules of subsidiarity, should be left to the Member States for decision.	1.4762319902160899
In my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue.	1.0135621728322621
In Ireland all the major users of water, commercial, industrial and agricultural, already pay for their use of water.	1.0995769811821356
This is a decision of national and local government, and this is where all future decisions should be retained.	1.4969975358708048
These are the main reasons for my vote.	0.8530795134543854
. The European Union is currently in the process of adopting new EU water legislation to update and to establish a long-term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters.	1.2721209010226582
I support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy.	1.1236315476828023
However, I do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used.	1.3185232255933115
Water, in this context, is a commercial commodity.	1.5161676770293147
It is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life.	1.0692721849909024
We see it as positive that an attempt is being made to reverse the trend towards water degradation, which is most alarming and which governments all too often tend to sweep under the carpet.	1.0948280961073613
We all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved.	1.1592251942917182
But it is also essential to bear in mind that the various elements of water policy cannot be separated, and that action on this aspect will affect all the others.	1.4730267821363896
The "physico-chemical and ecological quality of water" was highlighted during the debate and in the proposals, and the adverse effects of other aspects was, at best, touched upon marginally.	1.2768301880884143
It is essential to be aware of the widely varying situations in different Member States, such as specific climatic conditions, water regimes and fluctuations in them over the year, the social, economic and ecological effects of applying standards, and also of the failure to do so.	1.3171892205490738
It was because of our concern about these issues that we disagreed with some of the proposals put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and in particular those relating to an excessively restrictive timetable and to the scant attention paid to social and agricultural aspects, which are very important for a country like Portugal, which suffers from water shortage problems and also inadequate socio-economic development.	1.2252162101118322
But we also believe that, in many cases, the proposals put forward by the Commission and the Council represent too much of a step backwards, which is why we would like to see a vote balanced between the various requirements in the proposals presented to us.	1.5096816776976112
. (FR) We are disappointed by the Council' s common position on this proposal for a framework directive.	1.461031681453172
It is minimalist on a number of points, especially with regard to the dates of entry into force of far too many provisions and the number of, and conditions for, implementing the derogations.	1.1940143621909152
However, the main problem is with the definition of the objective which the European Union wishes to pursue with this text.	1.5466285437253253
The objective is of course to create, first and foremost, a clear general framework which will allow the law in this area to be simplified.	1.3645699883403986
However the Union should be seeking, beyond that, to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater.	1.2650816357051289
Public health and the supply of drinking water are at stake, as are biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural areas and species.	1.331638989857833
From this point of view, the common position is weak.	1.131173086805
I should like to see our Parliament defend a more ambitious position than the Council' s position, but I should also like that position to be equally credible.	1.4256435962688612
The "zero input" and "zero pollution" requirement, including for substances naturally present in water, is not realistic.	1.2676353983494364
I am not one of those MEPs who thinks that it is essential to adopt "extremist" amendments at second reading with the sole aim of gaining room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiations with the Council of Ministers.	1.117911299776644
On the contrary, I object to this systematically applied strategy.	1.136151351068048
It damages Parliament.	0.34653630476353464
Our messages to our citizens and to the Council are muddled and lack credibility.	1.3975559500830492
Overly strict, unrealistic environmental objectives will not be applied because they are unattainable.	0.9906426789352876
Is that the message we want to send out?	1.2281112726897983
There is one other specific point which is dear to me: Member States should be able, if they so wish, to set up trans-national water transfers.	1.4064256607865488
This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity, which we have always defended, and, as such, should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds).	1.4098985021469277
I would like to remind the House that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European water networks two years ago and I would be most obliged if the European Commission could shortly tell Parliament what action it has taken on that report.	1.3545923784431946
.	-0.0
(ES) We have seen a report concerned with water quality in Europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war.	1.184406373624708
We all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective, above all, given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment.	1.0654017060734615
It is clear that this model' s logic of private profit has been harmful, and therefore the 'polluter pays' principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences.	1.2231734870430937
However, apart from these principles, there is the consideration that water, as a common resource, cannot be subjected to the rules of the market.	1.481659132663765
Surprisingly, I imagine with the best of intentions, this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers, and especially the agricultural sector, responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality.	1.3335698625424655
In fact, water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market.	1.2161149233281525
This means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water.	1.052288721184334
By failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant, and is therefore not a problem, from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity, stifling the chances of any economic and social development, we are perverting the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon.	1.3185132393978045
In the same way it is somewhat ironic that we are hindering the possibility of sharing this commodity, which is scarce in some areas, while regions where there is abundant water are giving advice on austerity with regard to its use, to those who live in drought areas.	1.3748052716314356
As a result of this lack of sensitivity and solidarity, my vote has been consistent with what I have said, as an MEP from one of the dry Mediterranean agricultural regions - although one with prospects - namely, the Region of Murcia.	1.3470077995025522
. On behalf of the European Parliament Labour Party, I wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the Lienemann report, we have certain reservations.	1.4989233235543002
The timetable set in the report of 2020 is unrealistic and impracticable, but the timetable set by the Council of 2034 is too far in the distance.	1.4798390879813539
We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	0.8538574402573964
We have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater.	0.9260814997250377
We believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near pristine standard.	1.0529943674710138
The foregoing is the reason for our vote.	0.9564351948621219
.	-0.0
(FR) Water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed.	0.9689223983137446
The framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area.	0.976928922252768
It has clear, ambitious objectives.	0.7481861179292039
We share them.	0.5197186520548769
It sets environmental parameters close to zero.	0.6407523097244506
But we feel that it would be wiser not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet.	1.0691189820280143
We need a timetable, by all means, but a more gradual timetable.	1.5819733153105149
The legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation, i.e. to stop discharges within 20 years, would in fact mean a ban on all identified substances.	1.3088541254473727
Such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross-border areas and in candidate countries, thereby complicating enlargement.	1.0711772651385123
I should like, naturally, to refer to a specific sector to which I am very closely attached, i.e. agriculture, the main water-consuming sector. Agriculture must accept its share of 'polluter pays' charges, and has in fact already started to do so, but account must also be taken of its special characteristics and constraints, especially in arid regions.	1.5178681768483173
As regards the amendments concerning radioactive substances, I am of course in favour of controls, but the question arises of the legal basis, which comes under the Euratom Treaty.	1.513206361924713
Andersson report (A5-0033/2000)	0.5775362296155915
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the Andersson report. This does, of course, contain a number of good observations.	1.2014770656908138
For example, it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that "the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the Member States make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the Member States' social security systems" .	1.326309735983745
Now, the concept of "uniform harmonisation" is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question. It is also true, as it states in the explanatory statement, that harmonisation could be damaging as "it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security.	1.2473056772736795
No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation" .	0.6154479861301028
The situation, however, is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation, and uniform harmonisation into the bargain.	1.2463465585505082
Paragraph D points out that "the Union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria" , and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the Ecofin Council and the Social Affairs and Employment Councils.	1.4013949073264331
Finally, paragraph 7 emphasises that "the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" . And, in this regard, we approach the heart of the matter.	1.427029534715348
This project, with its social harmonisation, does not constitute social policy. Instead, it is an extension to the EU' s EMU project, which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside EMU and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship, namely Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark.	1.420445771896738
It is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project.	1.2323878699178292
) Mr President, I voted for the Council's strategy for modernising social protection because, in my view, it constitutes a step towards the establishment of European social and pensions legislation, although it does not actually go the whole way.	1.2976533763598974
I was sorry to hear what was said in the previous explanation of vote, since I believe that, in essence, the report aims to provide much better protection for the elderly, despite the fact that, as we all know, the governments of the 15 Member States would like to reduce pensions to the minimum.	1.5207177775119183
I hope that Parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pensions.	1.4187187586479666
The elderly are waiting for the European Parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with greater dignity than they do now.	1.2714624154491119
The countries who have made less progress in this field should attain the same level as the countries within the European Union that guarantee better social protection.	1.2322791634299404
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted today in favour of the report by our Swedish Social Democratic colleague, Jan Andersson, on the Commission' s communication concerning a coordinated strategy for modernising social security.	1.1907407288332654
The starting point for the Commission' s communication is the implementation of EMU which, with its demand for stability and growth, creates the basis for the Member States' being able to maintain their social security arrangements.	1.3422755899272565
The report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but, rather, better use of available resources.	1.192542909770221
We also notice that, according to the explanatory statement, modernisation does not mean harmonisation of social security arrangements, either, and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time that competitive considerations might exert pressure on others to cut back.	1.1346035703250834
No-one would benefit from this situation.	0.6250201515600682
Both in the communication from the Commission and in the report by Mr Andersson, it is emphasised that it is the Member States which have responsibility for and, therefore, also determine the content of, social security arrangements.	1.5745974064771757
Cooperation on these matters within the framework of the EU should create added value, based on the exchange of experiences and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policies are developing, the aim being to define best practice.	1.3270752000749888
. (SV) We consider that the report contains many practical proposals, which we support, but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report.	1.4074551504653903
In particular, we oppose the sections which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the Commission' s becoming involved in telling the Member States what to do (see, for example, paragraph 7).	1.3331289927770855
We wish to emphasise that the sphere of social and social security policy should chiefly be the domain of the Member States, even if the enlargement of the EU requires a greater degree of coordination than there has been in the past.	1.3006315530969146
. (FR) The current difficulties faced by our social security systems derive mainly from a shortage of income as the result of unemployment, poverty and an ageing population rather than from excessive spending.	1.0001468536945923
The policies of the European Union also have much to answer for in this situation.	1.3566791264192841
Of course we need to modernise these systems.	1.0099835185764485
In France, in particular, we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions.	1.069347484945229
We also need to reform archaic management methods which create injustices, chaos and waste.	0.8306935054431919
More importantly, we need a family policy to promote demographic growth and an economic, monetary and fiscal policy to promote growth and reconquer the internal market so that we can create jobs.	1.2904537716311169
The Commission and the Andersson report are not proposing a social policy; they are giving Brussels exorbitant decision-making powers as regards funding, i.e. as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of Europe, which is why we voted against this text.	1.3645533598189228
Social protection should be an expression, first and foremost, of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost, exclusively in fact, under the jurisdiction of the nation state.	1.2919590877404454
Social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences.	1.1374933336838753
Otherwise it is merely the financial processing, at the expense and to the detriment of European citizens, of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration.	1.4312117151368025
.	-0.0
(SV) We have abstained from voting for Jan Andersson' s report on a coordinated strategy for modernising social security.	1.145117124086638
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.	0.912113918479518
As Swedish Liberals, we see European integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management.	1.1881456789970808
In these areas, Europe' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity.	0.9535977293256446
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect.	1.3009889728745831
That is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see.	1.3286405641422667
It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with, which is to say cross-border issues.	1.429911554762955
All other questions ought to be dealt with at local, regional or national levels.	0.8568592864137677
Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU ought only to have limited powers, except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union.	1.2026868517009293
Each Member State ought to have full responsibility for, and the right autonomously to decide upon, its social security systems.	1.3825182037177501
Health care, child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational.	1.0536089466494805
The same applies to labour market policy.	0.7579134607598568
We do not believe that common European legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security.	1.406781654470335
For us, it is important that the EU should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use.	1.3554729999661248
That does not, however, prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere.	1.2061043148930368
Equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our Liberal agenda.	0.9398938038815864
We wholeheartedly support, at national level, many of the ideas presented in Mr Andersson' s report.	1.2092884787055438
. (IT) The report gives a clear impression that the concerted strategy for modernising social protection in Europe will be accompanied by an analogous process of cohesion.	1.2597274049273939
We therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intentions.	0.8370219806333095
Numerous policies have already gone in this direction, albeit laboriously, and many more still need to do so before Europe, in terms of subsidiarity, is seen as one house, not only by its own people, but also by those in the candidate countries.	1.5084258200095864
Moreover, the European welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation.	1.4623395893767879
Consequently, if such systems are to continue to sustain development in the future, in light of the economic and employment changes taking place, as well as the requirements of society, modernisation is absolutely essential.	1.476390929130194
There are three main aspects that need to be highlighted.	0.9374484093006423
The first is that economic policy, employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional.	1.3598248387149727
The second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them.	0.8715517703223205
Nowadays, it is becoming more commonplace, as well as efficient, to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes.	1.4087342674017262
But, in our view, that does not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduced, either as regards the universality or, we hope, the quality of the basic social protection provided.	1.5123604918701319
It is, to a large extent, a principle of justice that imbues both health and pension schemes as well as social assistance, where, in particular, strategic coordination by the public authority is essential, even though it has been modernised.	1.357643033587597
The third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the European Union.	1.1896848122624013
Today, a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking, and the current systems are, in the main, run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual Member States.	1.522366739946159
Therefore, any modernisation process has to take account of economic, employment and social protection differences between the various countries, whether Member States or candidate countries.	1.5751170111875783
What is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process, which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences, should have the will and the know-how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse.	1.2849621152606867
It is, after all, a matter of civilisation, progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community.	1.2846486025958392
. (SV) The basic values common to the Member States of the European Union are based upon democracy, human freedoms and rights, and a social market economy.	1.4644428366088025
These values must be given expression in the form of solidarity with the weaker groups in our society and in the world around us.	1.2122239554081304
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is the Member States themselves which devise their own social security systems.	1.1515404597862702
Inhabitants of countries in the European Union ought, nonetheless, to be able to benefit from a minimum network of social protection, irrespective of which country they live in.	1.2286649445934996
The report seeks "effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" , without going on to define more specifically what this means.	1.072602366957812
As we see it, such a position constitutes unduly large interference in national fiscal policy and cannot, therefore, be supported.	1.0652179726899833
We are therefore voting against paragraph 7 of the report.	1.0081951600502406
The report emphasises the social dimension of European cooperation, which is something to be welcomed.	1.1825820378297438
It is nonetheless important to clarify what role the EU is to play, and not to play, with regard to social security.	1.345617803630098
Clarification of this kind is missing from the report, which is unfortunate.	1.3507221815064114
. (EL) On reading the Commission' s statement on social protection, which is animated by so many good intentions, one wonders whether its authors and the working people in Europe are living on the same continent and in the same social reality.	1.444380112013728
One also wonders whether this 'coordinated modernisation strategy' is not just another misrepresentation of the coordinated and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquired rights of working people.	1.1613786697721955
We agree with many of the rapporteur' s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the Commission' s and the Council' s intentions and plans concerning social protection.	1.2477385754620933
The general lines of the implemented economic policy, the Stability Pact and the strict convergence programmes, which are a constant menace to employment and which promote employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations, and the organisation of labour, along with Commission and the ESF decisions relating to salary and wage restraint, and the insistence upon austere budgetary discipline and upon achieving much-vaunted monetary stability at all costs, leave no doubt about the new strategy' s objectives and aspirations.	1.2973307896297974
Its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security, and for flexibilising social protection itself.	1.2182063795317508
When social security has repeatedly, and in the words of many influential people, been characterised as a 'cost' and an 'obstacle' to greater competitiveness and when ways are being sought to transfer that cost from companies to working people - always, of course, on the pretext that this will create jobs - it would surprise us if the existing model of market economy without accountability, with its dismal monetary-economic approach to everything and total dependence on monopolistic interests, were to take under its protection the fundamental right of the citizens to social protection and care.	1.3312534159939877
Clearly, what is being attempted is to move away from organised systems of social security under state control, towards systems based on private insurance agencies, which will generate new profits for capital and place even greater burdens on working people, who besides the higher cost, will 'enjoy' even more degraded social provisions.	1.2517427728203678
The fostering of illicit competition between public and private social security systems and between the systems of the Member States is not only unjustifiable, but, on the contrary, makes manifest the political expediencies and intolerable pressures imposed upon social security systems to weaken or even do away with them, to the benefit of the private sector and the law of profit.	1.2668034886100255
It is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems.	1.063239574657354
So how is it possible to speak about healthy and economically sustainable social security systems when we are faced with the millions of unemployed, impoverished and marginalised people, the 'working poor' of part-time employment, and working conditions that are dissociated from the policies implemented?	1.2115065056045733
Social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in Europe, and were achieved after many years of battling against the aspirations of big business, and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people.	1.1627741274465888
Today, in the Europe of unemployment and underemployment, it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people, but this demands a different system of economic and social development, which the EU cannot possibly create, because of its nature and character.	1.5225208571747584
On the basis of these views, we wish to express our categorical opposition to the 'modernisation' of the social protection system that the Commission statement is promoting, and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is under discussion.	1.5238194520925885
That concludes the explanations of vote.	1.0693158865388868
(The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	0.5015563376244329
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission (continuation)	0.827518542979658
The next item is the debate on the Council declaration on the establishing of the EU priorities for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (20 March 2000), including the situation in China.	1.3138479749294647
Mr President, I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. This is a Council declaration, and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate.	1.5065920889359008
I think it is worth reminding you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflects the need, which has been expressed by all the political Groups, for Parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue, one which is so dear to this House.	1.4177487170660688
Following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see.	1.372776263030011
At a European Union level we must recognise that the situation is not completely satisfactory, since, for example, although the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a common instrument in all Member States, not all subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all of them.	1.4316601189004963
Another clear drawback in this area is the fact that the European Union itself is not a signatory to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails.	1.3148362171608814
I hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights.	1.371409151513035
With regard to foreign affairs, I believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism, Mr President. Issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world, demand a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union.	1.2955888956787263
In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would like to stress one in particular, that is, the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations.	1.4607369320209562
Mr President, in a world such as this, which is increasingly dominated by the phenomenon of globalisation, and not only in the economic field, our responses, in order to be effective, must be concerted and coordinated.	1.5720372188767762
In order to make our actions effective, we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present.	1.3947372441641392
This Parliament therefore advocates the principle that we need to participate in the Commission on Human Rights and other international fora which deal with these issues and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this Parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible.	1.2996127222339615
Soon, in May, the European Commission intends to present a communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratisation in the Union' s external relations.	1.6159638778406702
I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to take good note of this need for coordination, which I have just mentioned, and to seek new formulas which will strengthen the role played by the European Union in the field of human rights and, in particular, by this Parliament, especially from the point of view of coherence, recognising the good will of those third countries which accept the inclusion of the democratic clause.	1.4486515580622146
I believe that this should be applied to all areas, in particular also the budgetary area.	1.572943829350584
Lastly, I must recognise the important contributions made by civil society in this area, as well as the often underestimated role of the numerous non-governmental organisations who act on the ground.	1.4083039891135314
The Union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work.	1.1441940107940218
Mr President, Commissioners, when this House is called upon to debate human rights it is taking a chance, if you will, that is reinforced by the conditions that prevail when we are called upon to discuss such a crucial issue.	1.3475325191437113
The absence of the Council, as well as of the majority of MEPs, shows just how great the divide is between our noble, elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day-to-day policies when it comes to human rights.	1.1210170012402858
I believe that, as a beginning, Parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the Geneva session to narrow that divide. It should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support.	1.397856357888606
We must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the headlines or abuses are being punished.	1.0848202523984904
The role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on, particularly at the level of prevention.	1.2373377708712254
In that sense, we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law.	1.0758556769063221
It seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed.	1.1737987858046206
Nowadays, there are many, perhaps too many, treaties on human rights. If those treaties remain mere expressions, they are no more than useless depositories of people's thoughts.	1.4469121529869877
The time has come to move on to a new and crucial phase, namely a phase in which the provisions of the treaties are applied on a daily and binding basis, although we ought not forget that some basic treaties are still to be transposed.	1.440867119596498
I refer to the Rome Conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 Member States of the Union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court.	1.1262127457080904
In my view, we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally.	1.2803135776127528
We have often employed instruments which, at the formal level, make us feel comfortable, but which, in terms of practical results, are totally ineffectual.	1.4421643520705323
By that I mean the use, and often abuse, of embargoes during recent years, and the over-cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the European Union and third countries, where there have been human rights violations.	1.4877661233041415
In particular, we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded.	1.2974511525424155
Globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process.	0.827909489069531
Many countries are currently questioning the principle of the universality of human rights. The belief is widespread that many human rights, including the right to life, contradicted as it is by the death penalty, depend on certain variables, while globalisation, which often has a negative connotation, is in danger of becoming the catch-all for rights, actions and policies everywhere in the world.	1.3470521012377432
We should therefore do what is necessary to update the areas in which we can intervene, with renewed strength, to safeguard human rights.	1.4644390117554467
In that context I would mention the following: social rights, workers' rights, quality of work, the need to ensure respect, where necessary, for all the criteria laid down by the International Labour Organisation, the right to tolerance and to respect - a right to which all minorities are entitled, particularly within the European Union.	1.5394289282055915
I would also mention the right to develop. It is the right of all peoples who, in turn, are the sum of countless individuals each one of whom has the right to develop and to a future that, most importantly, is full of hope and personal growth, within each individual society.	1.5435328384686269
All those aspects should be part of a rationale, a discourse and a contribution which the European Union should bring to human rights.	1.3517522486549411
I hope that Parliament's participation in the Geneva session turns out to be more than just a token presence and that its representatives do more than just listen to and give evidence. First and foremost they should use the occasion to affirm that we regard the aspects I have just mentioned as central to the identity of the European Union and of the European nation, and that we also uphold the principle of the universality of human rights that transcends time and place.	1.4168371317934743
That is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments, even if it goes against their interests.	1.3583301571524673
Mr President, one of the saving features of this Parliament is that here we practise a consistent and active human rights policy: the flag flies high, as Mrs Malmström put it.	1.3839335218995208
At the same time, however, we shut our eyes to the Union' s own problems: to the violence, inequality, and fourth world reality, which is part of everyday life in the EU.	1.387737187182994
It is absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violations of human rights that are to be the subject of talks in Geneva.	1.2092133298537897
The rhetoric that we use, however, often smacks of smugness, verging on the sort of narcissism we associate with human rights attitudes in North America.	1.0139858973712774
It is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non-EU countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum-seekers, whose position is now becoming more difficult in the EU.	1.060354000940883
Let us, in particular, focus attention on the re-admission clauses, which present a threat to the Geneva Convention and which should be blocked.	1.2998326712553716
Unless we can maintain high standards of human rights with respect to refugees and asylum-seekers, we are not worthy of those European values which make up the European identity, as Vaclav Havel said here today, and among which he particularly mentioned respect for human rights and solidarity.	1.2936622742761563
I worked for many years on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it was really moving to see how a nation in such difficult circumstances was reaching out for a more open, European-style, pluralistic democratic society.	1.2107357689601908
I fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction, towards European exclusiveness and apartheid.	1.2126140937239291
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, the question which needs to be raised in Geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty.	1.101145879622169
We have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in Geneva.	0.9957741587611372
We failed at the General Assembly last year on a fallacious pretext, I refer to article 2.7, which we are otherwise happy to adopt for all other texts.	1.3897677307963148
The question of the death penalty should therefore be raised at this year' s General Assembly, certainly not at the Geneva session.	1.0263576074607343
As Mr Patten said, and I would like to thank him for the positions which he defended, the crucial point is China.	1.2744847918473174
Unfortunately, the positions taken by the Commission and the Council, or at least the presidency, are more than just a hair' s breadth apart; this is serious, especially in the light of the Council' s macho position on Austria.	1.4221070978445836
In my view, as far as China is concerned, and knowing that the European Union' s policy towards China has been a total failure, allegedly constructive dialogue has got us nowhere or, worse, it has given the Chinese new pretexts for increasing repression and for strengthening religious repression and the repression of freedoms (as Mrs Wallström has said with regard to the Internet) in all sectors, in Tibet, in inland Mongolia, in eastern Turkistan.	1.3749839597978994
There is regression in every sector of Chinese civil society.	0.7254611236139598
It is a fact: China is the major threat, the major threat to us, the threat which we must confront, the threat to peace.	1.6530612005528083
It is the antithesis of democracy and you know as well as I that the Chinese, the Chinese leadership, is Communist first and Chinese second.	1.3931148980448487
China likes doublespeak.	0.34656666519980434
Until we have a firm position, we will achieve nothing with the Chinese authorities.	1.447598400607105
I think we need to seize the opportunity.	1.0710398384581723
We need to associate ourselves with the American initiative.	1.0770849525986206
We need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted.	1.263706167048618
We need to work.	1.1213014837168178
The Fifteen need to start work right now, with all the members of the United Nations; we need, at long last, to issue a firm condemnation and then use that as a basis to gain a negotiating position.	1.3045242754518458
Mr President, I would like to try to put a different perspective to this.	1.116257506473275
As you know, on Monday an unmanned spacecraft went into orbit around a peanut-shaped asteroid called Eros which is not very far from earth.	1.1092287983793527
Photographs show us that there is no life on the asteroid, but much further out in our galaxy, the Milky Way, there are about 300 billion stars, many with planets.	1.4359916181857568
Beyond the Milky Way there are 300 billion other galaxies with countless stars and planets.	0.6678367547887244
It is probable, therefore, that there is a lot of life out there, and much of it much more advanced than we are.	1.1586795426268433
Bearing in mind that the first television programmes from earth are now 50 light years out into space way beyond the nearest stars, I invite you to imagine with me what life out there in the stars thinks of us as they look at us.	1.1591341369476895
What do they see?	0.4539717885892694
They see a beautiful planet, teeming with life, but they see its atmosphere being polluted and warming up.	1.1376626671378747
They see forests being cut down and deserts spreading.	0.7199061467856616
Of the living creatures, they can see many animals that are treated cruelly, rare ones becoming extinct for ever.	1.0092725324634348
How do they see the currently dominant species - that is us?	1.3336678178424364
Well, they see the planet's resources being unevenly spread.	1.3050546481208374
They see land being fought over, medicine for disease but not in the parts of the world where it is most wanted, books for schools - but not at all in the least-developed areas of our world, 50% of the world's population never making a telephone call in their whole life.	1.3365579155319018
What do they see about the relationships between human beings?	0.7568663038045883
They see us killing each other.	0.7113746019129369
They see us restricting each other's liberties.	0.768709989203709
They see a never-ending series of local wars. They see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers, or treated as prostitutes or slaves.	1.232974630385395
They see unequal treatment of men and women, of people of different ages, of minorities, of people of different coloured skins, of races, of beliefs, of immigrants, even neighbours.	1.532515271161394
We all know the picture.	1.0392502838761648
The UN Convention on Human Rights 50 years ago was an attempt to correct this.	0.7674441557000434
We should salute it - and I think we do.	1.2168685362620173
Only in Europe are human rights enforceable in law.	0.8447694680843829
Here in the European Parliament some of the Members do not want the Charter of Rights, which is being discussed at the moment, to become enforceable in law.	1.684929505443948
I say: shame on them!	0.6294698690838888
Human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world.	1.030665874959969
That is the goal which we have to work towards.	1.5794406730783415
Much, as Commissioner Patten said, remains to be done.	1.3957407905942207
Finally, if you asked me: What if there is no life out there among the stars, what if we are alone? - which is an equally awe-inspiring thought - I would say: Do not you think we have a responsibility too to make our children behave properly, before letting them go out to populate other planets?	1.53631691562055
Mr President, human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated and interwoven.	1.3009151688876373
This well-known phrase, which is taken from the conclusions of the UN World Conference on human rights of 1993, is known off by heart by many.	1.4501003440982767
That is positive.	0.34442087788537745
But what about the human rights policy within the EU itself?	1.1600748218716816
Does it reflect this vision of coherence?	0.6604024602646156
In fact, does the European Union have a human rights policy?	1.6363986033701354
This question does not challenge the efforts made by the Member States who wish to bring their viewpoints on foreign policy into line and to display a united front against violations of human rights elsewhere, for example in China.	1.1423082917951901
No, Mr President, I am talking about the lack of human rights policy within the European Union itself.	1.1963638736766176
A new government has come into power in Austria, comprising a political party which has sent out a message of racism and intolerance vis-à-vis minorities.	1.1246085635830692
Human rights, which the EU embraces, are thus under threat, but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated.	1.5082513532967008
The widely quoted Article 7 of the Treaty, which provides for the repeal of membership rights from a Member State where serious and continuous violations against human rights have been established, is, of course, only a kill or cure remedy, an ultimum remedium, which, in the case of Austria, can only be quoted in the absence of anything more effective, and by way of warning.	1.2586219939483945
There is, therefore a need for a fully-fledged human rights policy for and by the European Union, a policy which promotes and enforces human rights within the EU itself.	1.4940608511568203
Such policy should comprise various components.	0.6028174400385528
Firstly: a regulatory framework is needed, which spells out very clearly the rights which the EU intends to secure for its citizens.	1.2346436002015693
A start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter, but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists.	1.188910540062398
This is a political question which, in the short term, requires an answer from the IGC and this Parliament.	1.392717701222505
Secondly: a range of instruments has to be developed which allow for a flexible response and which do not force us into a situation where we need to choose between a kill or cure remedy or a complete stab in the dark.	1.0521868821278872
The following spring to mind in this respect: the systematic collation of documentation and information, professional forms of observation, the development of information campaigns, the use of cash to support democratic forces in the country concerned, a more creative deployment of the resources which are available through multilateral diplomacy, such as organised dialogue and fact finding missions and such like.	1.261165013306925
Thirdly: it will need to be made clear for each of the EU institutions where the responsibility for human rights policy lies within the European Union and what the tasks and competences are that this entails.	1.5834385931391075
The Commission and the Council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be.	1.2105501621404997
This Parliament is excluded from this, for our Rules of Procedure stipulate that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs carries this responsibility.	1.316440209724836
But I am somewhat surprised that the resolution which should bring this debate on human rights to a conclusion has been prepared in the foreign sector of this Parliament and that the aforementioned Committee, of which I form part, has not been involved in this.	1.4204984473554645
Mr President, this Parliament is fragmented and divided.	1.320871613340837
For the sake of our credibility, we will have to speak with one voice when it comes to human rights and not act as if human rights within the EU are different from human rights elsewhere in the world.	1.2185776240019877
I think that this will benefit our credibility in the UN Human Rights Committee.	1.2178458434176407
Mr President, what will it take to make the debate on human rights something other than what it is today: an ideological instrument which helps to enslave peoples rather than free individuals?	1.3109917057042506
We must start by going beyond man, who is not the master of the universe, to the source of all genuine rights and civilised values, without which the eternal claim to rights always ends in tyranny and bloodshed.	1.2367048398751357
We need, in the ancient and mediaeval tradition of Europe, to go back to the natural order of the universe, i.e. to the Creation, and beyond that still further, to the Creator' s intention.	1.4929328325987166
Then we shall see that the rights of the child are only respected within a proper family, the rights of workers are only respected in the intermediary bodies which we have recently destroyed and that citizens' rights are only respected within sovereign states.	1.2985736693831127
Secondly, the doctrine of human rights must no longer be exploited, as it is today, as an instrument of ideological warfare in the hands of a cast which claims the right to decree unilaterally who is to be the arbiter of human rights and who is to be deprived of those rights, thereby denying the legitimacy and, if need be, the freedom of those whom the party line has deemed politically incorrect.	1.4595013389420903
'No freedom for the enemies of freedom' was what the advocates of the revolutionary Terror were saying two centuries ago, the advocates of the revolution which proved, alas, to be the mother of all modern totalitarian regimes.	1.1334971450087632
No human rights for the enemies of human rights is what the acolytes of the new world order are saying today, the new world order which reigns almost unchallenged in financial circles, in international institutions, in the media and cultural networks, and in educational institutions, to mention but a few.	1.5689632342681266
What is left, for example, of the right of Austrians to choose their own destiny, if that choice is dictated on their behalf by those who decide what should or should not be done and if their duly and legally elected leaders are received in an insulting manner, as they were recently by you in Portugal, Mr President of the Council.	1.3292756702612278
I do not know if he is still present and can hear me.	1.1935289412721446
What is left of the human rights of those who sympathise with the Vlaamsblok, one of the most important parties in the Flemish region, if tomorrow the Belgian Parliament adopts the implausible, indecent and ignominious bill tabled by its main political rivals, the Volksunie, which seeks quite simply to abolish the party?	1.1691743814398563
What is left of the right to engage in a critical study of history when authors and publishers are persecuted, as the young historian Jean Plantin was just yesterday before the Court of Appeal, in my home town of Lyon - he was the subject of an absurd, arrogant and offensive closing speech by the public prosecutor Jean-Olivier Viout, the smug expression of straitjacketed thinking and intellectual conformism?	1.264898309990852
It is a strange concept of human rights when peaceful patriotism is fraudulently equated with aggressive nationalism, when legitimate protests against immigration policies are equated with I do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identities is equated with racism.	1.127419044873443
What of the human rights of the millions of French people who voted for the National Front and who are deprived of any political representation and vilified daily, as they were on Monday on the television channels of the state to which they are required to pay taxes, when the simple expression of justifiably exasperated views by one of our colleagues, Mr Le Pen, is used as a pretext for iniquitous condemnation, in violation of the law and in violation of all notions of justice, fairness and morals, and when attempts are made, in violation of the clearest legislation, to deprive this representative of millions of our fellow citizens of the mandate which he has been given by their vote, not received as a favour from the government.	1.3694062125748558
In a word, I shall believe your talk about human rights in Europe, fellow Members, when you acknowledge that your political opponents have the same rights as you allow yourselves.	1.3134818732310443
I shall believe your talk about human rights in China when you name the real cause of the problem, i.e. Communism.	1.0590910962088131
Listen to the resounding voice of Solzhenitsyn in his letter to the Americans, in which he says that the main cause of the weakness of Western society is excessive pandering to legal individualism, an individualism which, far from allowing people to flourish, paves the way for future dictatorship, in fact the worst kind of dictatorship, because those whom it enslaves are not even aware of their terrible servitude.	1.332273916583749
Mr President, the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political legacies of the 20th century.	1.2081538765922242
The holocaust, fifty years ago, led to the need to lay down a number of fundamental rights and freedoms.	1.0974840091694664
Since the end of the cold war, compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation.	1.0543932988145885
Leaders violating these principles now face international criticism, sanctions and are even brought to trial, such as ex-dictators like Mr Pinochet have experienced.	1.0045889611093186
These developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very disquieting.	1.3944761053543413
Especially in situations of war, civilians are given less consideration all the time.	0.8499642906880521
It seems contradictory.	0.34623239669307104
Never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed.	0.8272425195563677
Never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries.	0.8248602826859862
Yet the most basic rules of conduct are being flouted on a massive scale and there are more civilian victims than there were a century ago.	1.162174486838679
Women are systematically raped.	0.4351291536233511
Children are conscripted by force and deployed in battle.	0.6653688149859489
Excesses are no longer the exception, they have unfortunately become the rule.	1.1310443644707144
This applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide.	0.7157123129180453
Too late, too selective and too fragmented: this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community.	1.3674231413285678
First of all, the policy comes too late.	1.0873373666819395
Both in Rwanda and Kosovo, the UN, despite the many warnings, appeared to be overtaken by events and stood by as a helpless observer of the massacres, as President Havel pointed out this afternoon.	1.2134772776956861
Fifty years later, we are still unable to prevent genocide.	1.2256836377155864
We should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency.	0.9444772008316462
Control of the arms trade and improved media control are essential in this.	0.9066380823000648
The human rights policy is also too selective.	1.057838953778965
The months of NATO bombardments of Kosovo and the mediation attempts in the Middle East are in stark contrast to international apathy with regard to the conflicts in Africa.	1.0556908481915501
I cannot shake off the impression that, when it comes to human rights, despite all the rhetoric, Africa does not feature on top of the agenda of the Portuguese Presidency. This is something which I very much regret.	1.3359793360953929
The impression that Africans get, namely that they are inferior world citizens, is not unfounded.	1.3764576146022613
I would like to warn against a blurring of standards in the assessment of human rights situations in Africa, where violations are viewed as a necessary evil.	1.1698693216502722
But above all, the human rights policy is too fragmented.	1.1965255937487056
We are unable to draft a common strategy within the international communities or Europe.	0.8148574880066487
Take Sudan.	-0.0
The international community is sending conflicting messages to this country.	0.9392837749434051
Britain has re-opened its embassy in Khartoum.	0.61341576520444
Canada has invited the Sudanese for peace talks.	0.6294150692445615
Europe puts the rebels in the South under pressure to negotiate and at the same time, Americans isolate the regime and support the rebels at military level.	0.9820434664738601
There is a need for more coordination, more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raised bids are avoided.	1.2421421769771757
Only then can we follow in the footsteps of the founders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.	0.9435869704250767
Mr President, I would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home.	1.1499889988193412
But unfortunately, as we speak today in the safety of this Chamber, human rights abuses are occurring throughout the free world.	1.4948080633426666
Sometimes the more we speak, the less we hear - motions: words; conventions: words; treaties: words - if we are not careful, words themselves become a substitute for real action.	1.1840857649676744
Words framed in inclusive and liberating documents become treaties and conventions which are often paraded as a testimony to a country's respect for and adherence to human rights.	0.8779078126660208
Yet words spoken, written or signed are not in themselves enough.	0.9664617204570211
Look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities, groups and individuals - the list is shameful and shaming.	1.2329952636901775
Can anyone argue with any persuasiveness that women are treated equally and fairly, that children have human rights or that people are not discriminated against because of their religion, belief, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, opinion, political affiliation etc?	1.0732963050725937
The defamation of minorities in newspapers and other media fuels discrimination.	0.7655617222100356
Even within the EU citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions.	1.057214297777919
Every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation are used to deny some minorities equality before the law and to denigrate ethnic minorities.	0.9454811575263923
Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created.	0.7259514623731964
And so long as people do not have equality before the law, this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded.	1.2239906679359958
In our enlargement process in the EU we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities.	1.2714487015134444
We must not waiver in that commitment.	1.0473664582828985
But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies.	1.0598080030690442
Yes, conventions have been signed, but action is needed.	1.324005563313836
I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices, eternal vigilance, not just outside our borders but within.	1.0898576030444898
That is why I would welcome an annual Member State report from each individual state which would have to record any charges against it and the action taken. Because what happens in each Member State happens to every single one of us.	1.2903603734790003
What happens in another part of the world affects us.	1.2524314055567891
Pinochet in Chile is as relevant as Haider in Austria.	0.7056318321641584
Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked.	0.9537815694524414
Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are connected to our development policies, our economic policies, our home affairs policies, indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions.	1.3884824434568241
I would repeat what Mr Patten said: we must engage, we must inform, educate and thereby effect real and lasting change.	1.4190237306594948
Mr President, "Europe stands for ideals, values and principles.	1.343012602742455
We must emphasise Europe' s spiritual history.	0.8538809424694933
Together, we must re-establish the values which unite Europe.	1.31926707914484
Spiritual values have been disseminated from Europe throughout the globe.	0.7490637159503397
We must live with our consciences."	0.7727226109275345
These were the words spoken three hours ago in this Chamber by the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel.	1.0220763266974167
In an extraordinarily edifying speech, characterised by wisdom, historical knowledge, an understanding of the human heart and insight into Europe' s spiritual and Christian heritage, he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity.	1.1464005197615494
We should be grateful that there are Heads of State like Vaclav Havel in our Europe.	1.2853746993427646
I wish to discuss two matters.	0.7873212865381961
First of all, civil society.	0.9637623868663746
Vaclav Havel stated that, in Eastern Europe, the Communist regimes methodically destroyed civil society: national movements, churches and the independent trade unions.	1.1564740539706024
The same is happening in China in connection with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches.	1.1078823191183458
It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet.	0.790163545868044
We must never forget to defend civil society.	0.7109982249192219
I also want to mention the death penalty.	0.8029301945917234
Like my own country, Sweden, the EU bases its view of human beings upon the equal, unique and inviolable value of every human.	1.1005358879689848
On the basis of this principle, human beings should always have the chance to redeem themselves.	1.300731105699461
Try telling that to the governments of the United States, Russia and China.	1.0991082184752536
Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, I believe the approach of EU Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situations in Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and China.	1.137136599680223
In relation to China, we should not be dissuaded from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked.	1.0885775847891572
However, it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts as one, and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve.	1.3805397176750387
However, if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at Geneva, then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be provided with the necessary resources.	1.6878846923183228
The financial resources of the United Nations are spread very thinly and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat.	0.9967063044807605
Resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights, strategic planning, the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the United Nations.	1.1539094131694265
To this end the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks.	1.0788106841732956
The European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds.	1.1755023759984833
In so doing, we would not only embarrass the United States into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to UN funding, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric.	1.3571720861405863
Mr President, this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual UN Human Rights Convention and the Commission' s and Council' s efforts in this respect.	1.4848420838664944
I would first of all like to say that I am very pleased with the contributions made by Mr Patten and the Minister, and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba are on the agenda.	1.3355128134287517
Cuba is the last stronghold of dictatorship in South America and we must be mindful of this, with all due sympathy to Cuba.	1.3392014719883236
It is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy.	1.1408234695530273
I would, during my two minutes, like to draw attention to two countries which are close to my heart.	1.140615094271145
The first country is Indonesia.	0.583459691843978
We are naturally delighted that Indonesia is under new rule and that Mr Wahid and Mrs Sukarnoputri are the new President and Vice-President.	1.0384450033712773
We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction.	1.0527205739235659
But I can report that in the Moluccas, an area just north of Timor, the violence is still not under control.	1.4310923053621567
This has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years.	0.8466751503079739
Tens of thousands of people are on the run.	0.882131411085197
The situation is badly managed.	0.8443438714162345
I know that tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, an important programme will be shown on Dutch television, in which an appeal will be made for observers. This is with the sole purpose of monitoring what exactly is going on, so that at least a record can be made, not least for the future, for human rights committees, of what has been happening.	1.6357117691720355
My urgent request, which has been echoed many times in resolutions, is the following: could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the Moluccas?	1.2045082071277844
Surely thousands of people killed, thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough.	0.9390765253419497
My second country - I will be brief as Mr Patten knows this country very well - is Burma.	1.353918982329799
Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma.	0.8661205366608107
I have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion.	0.9969957971475539
For ten years now, the elected President of that country has been under house arrest.	1.1501431315489838
And for ten years now, its parliament has been out of action.	1.071958906049279
Numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma.	1.0255665092487127
There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention.	1.0806316495129515
In my opinion, Burma should be put back on the agenda, too, certainly in the wake of Indonesia' s U-turn.	1.0502861900373295
Surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch, even by Europe.	1.1148092952407207
My request is, in fact, to put this country back on the top of the agenda.	1.330940421368803
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, economic clout cannot be the only factor that determines the European Union' s status in the world.	1.202713699390394
One of the EU' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights, as exercised both within the Union and by our partners.	1.3873491062099224
The European Parliament has been at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human rights, and it has succeeded in overcoming the limits imposed by self-interest and "national interests" , which are sometimes reflected in the positions adopted by the Member States and even by other European Union institutions.	1.3859419965885678
We can therefore safely say, for example, that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten, which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people, who always opposed occupation by Indonesia.	1.4277757280976064
By the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia, a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account.	1.2855744935038511
But it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position.	1.0108026772596674
It is vital that when violations are committed, the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity, whoever or wherever they may be - in Indonesia or Angola, in Cuba, China or Burma, whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers, humble foot-soldier or general or even a minister.	1.2622173953798626
Justice needs to be done in Indonesia.	0.9612169642237035
Justice needs to be done in East Timor.	0.9680452868745202
President Wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with.	0.8767021682291242
The specific reference in this resolution to East Timor, on the initiative of the PPE Group, is a timely one.	1.3358382313459092
Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there, some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House; they cannot go unpunished.	1.2731398775457448
It is impossible to talk about East Timor without mentioning the tens of thousands of Timorese refugees living on Indonesian soil in inhumane conditions, under the control of Indonesian soldiers and militias, and being used as bargaining chips.	1.029972839688535
This is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency.	1.0459957877383586
.	-0.0
(PT) Mr President, I would like to make a few very brief comments on behalf of the Council presidency, and first to remind you that the work done by the presidency is above all about coordination and about seeking common positions on initiatives that the fifteen Member States are to approve in the Council. Our experience of previous sessions of the Human Rights Commission suggests - precisely by virtue of this coordinating role played by successive presidencies - that the European Union is very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the Commission, and it is important to maintain this.	1.3867891715285867
I would also like to say that the European Parliament' s participation in the preparatory work is important in establishing coherent European Union positions on various different issues, and that the presidency therefore naturally welcomes all the various suggestions and in particular all the contributions made through the resolutions which have been presented.	1.28447792627086
I would also like to stress, as many Members have highlighted, that human rights policy is at the heart of Europe' s identity and that respect for human rights should be seen as a fundamental principle for international cooperation by the European Union.	1.3260115954121183
Hence the need for the most coherent European human rights policy possible, which of course means that we need to adopt clear and unambiguous positions where we consider a state of affairs to be unacceptable, and I have in mind, in particular, the references that many Members have made to China.	1.477533937503058
But we have also duly noted the concerns expressed by many other Members about other countries, notably Indonesia, East Timor, the Moluccas and Burma.	1.2578277279560226
I could not conclude without mentioning Mr Van Hecke' s speech in particular, in which he referred to the human rights situation in Africa and to the role and priorities of the Portuguese Presidency, and questioned the sincerity of the priority we are giving to relations with the European Union.	1.3767551043183779
I would simply like to say that the Portuguese Presidency has, in these two short months, organised the first Development Council, admittedly an informal one, whose agenda was rightly dominated by EU-Africa relations. Indeed it was this subject which led the development ministers of the fifteen Member States to meet in Lisbon for discussions specifically on the new era these relations have entered.	1.343357121318155
Furthermore, I cannot stress enough the significance of our having concluded important negotiations on the new convention to succeed the Lomé Convention, and the fact that, following extremely complex and difficult negotiations, we have succeeded in organising - or making preparations for the organisation of - the first EU-Africa Summit.	1.5862753529831337
For all these reasons I thought it essential to reply directly to Mr Van Hecke' s question on this issue.	1.0912218830912268
. Mr President, this has been a very useful debate.	1.3515204914545165
One or two speeches have referred to specific issues which we are well advised to think about very carefully.	1.1332923992212727
For example, Mrs Maij-Weggen referred to both Indonesia and Burma and made some important points about both those countries and the human rights situation there.	1.3117078611279924
What I would like to focus on very briefly are one or two themes which ran through our debate.	1.0734275404265785
One of the very first speakers, Mr Wuori, spoke of the remarks made earlier today by Mr Havel.	1.4022504873236699
It was a remarkable speech and I hope that Mr Gollnisch, who is no longer able to be with us, was able to hear that speech as well.	1.4457579068410291
I also hope that, if there is any life in outer space, as has been speculated by Mr Newton Dunn, it was tuned in to Mr Havel' s speech as well.	1.3809478075831967
Mr Havel reminded us that the Union is not just about markets, about GDP growth, it is a Union of values that is reflected in the Treaties and is reflected in our obligations in the whole area of external assistance, reflected quite specifically in what we are charged to do.	1.409343565597648
How do we implement what the Treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes?	1.0545588284690763
One or two honourable Members, Mr Ferber and Mr Cushnahan, spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality.	1.0263329962495813
Mr Cashman said, which is right in a sense, that words are no substitute for real action.	1.3320095157224836
Of course, words can make a bit of a difference, a point that was made by Mrs Malmström.	1.5198822920004664
She said that she had received a letter from the Chinese Ambassador, a very amiable and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country, to tell her that she was wrong and the European Parliament was wrong in its attitude on human rights in China.	1.3913417958999472
I think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letters from the Chinese authorities.	0.8444273279938606
She will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in China.	1.096431762484645
I think she was reflecting the views of many non-governmental organisations, many people who admire Chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in China today.	1.1053664848935503
Of course it is entirely right that we have to look at action, and the very first speech by Mr Salafranca mentioned two issues apart from Geneva which represent actions, one of which is of course made possible by the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of the European taxpayer - that is the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - about EUR 100 million that is spent through programmes, for which I am responsible, mainly going to non-governmental organisations to promote human rights and to promote democratisation.	1.5123481092880962
We will want to share with Parliament, as vicars say, our views on how that spending programme to support human rights can be best focused and best targeted in the years ahead.	1.2111689127075536
There is also the question which was referred to by Mr Salafranca, who I am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate.	1.283428193588646
There is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy.	1.3721020373175377
I want to remind Parliament that the Commission will be publishing, before the middle of the year, a comprehensive, intellectual case for placing human rights at the heart of the development of the common foreign and security policy.	1.3781462083623413
It is immensely important, and if I had not thought that already, having listened to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion.	1.3096273404410164
It has been a useful debate.	1.1746671474411152
I hope we can have further debates like this.	0.9243497159860083
I hope we can have, in particular, debates about some of the ways in which we translate these good intentions into practice on the ground where it matters, where people are still being tortured, where people are still being raped and are still being denied the sort of civil rights that this House takes for granted, as I do.	1.3146254701193125
I have received 7 motions for resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2), to close the present statement.	1.0343101088339228
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place on Thursday.	0.48365152987030724
Cyprus and Malta	-0.0
The next item is the joint debate on:	0.5092735916158166
the Council statement on the position of the European Union on developments concerning Cyprus;	1.1438398793808708
the report (A4-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta [COM(1999)0535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)].	0.7960906725777349
Mr Seixas da Costa has the floor on behalf of the Council.	0.948521165565327
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I would like to present to you certain information about the re-opening of the intra-Cyprus negotiations and recent developments in this area.	1.241520088386434
I think it will be obvious to everyone that the events in Helsinki at the end of last year and the new era in relations between the European Union and Turkey have created a new backdrop, at Community level, which we cannot ignore when it comes to relations between the two Cypriot communities.	1.4738526251437094
At the beginning of December 1999, the first round of negotiations were held in New York, after an interruption of several years in negotiations between the Cypriot communities in the north and south of the island.	1.293090997818346
These negotiations took the form of indirect discussions mediated by the UN special representative, Álvaro de Soto.	1.003874952053995
A further round was held in January this year, starting on 31 January, and a third round is scheduled to start on 23 May in New York.	1.1476503296961804
There is a possibility, which has not yet been absolutely confirmed, that continuous and direct discussions may take place, with work continuing until September this year.	1.4480720291888163
These discussions essentially cover four areas: security, the structure of government, territorial adjustments and issues relating to refugees and compensation, as a result of the situation following the partition of the island.	1.1245231095060972
However, agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues, and the representative of the northern part of the island, Rauf Denktash, has suggested three new topics: sovereignty, confidence-building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island.	1.198152755387361
The discussions held so far have essentially resulted in two developments. The first is the possibility of opening up a direct information channel between the European Union and the north of the island, without this necessarily signifying recognition of this part of the island as a legal personality at international level, but as a means of facilitating adoption of the acquis communautaire with a view to eventual accession of the whole island, if a solution can, in the meantime, be found to the broader problem of the partition of the island.	1.3515506495584637
The second development which we regard as important is the statement made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the end of the first day' s discussions to the effect that an overall settlement of the situation would involve recognition of the specific situation of the north of the island.	1.2650442978074885
This is the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis.	1.2727974562347304
Certain expectations exist about the third round of negotiations, in view of the proposed scenarios being prepared with the involvement of representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom, in particular in the areas of security and the constitutional structure, which it is envisaged will be presented at this round through the good offices of the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.	1.2520414325821778
This will take place after the election in the north of the island scheduled for 18 April.	1.111238996395181
Furthermore, the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has decided, following the example of previous presidencies, to appoint a representative to establish contacts with the various parties involved in this issue.	1.4849782674944343
This representative has already contacted all these parties and has, in close cooperation with the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, been monitoring and assisting with the work of the various rounds.	1.1846548993908645
In particular, we intend that the European Union should maintain a constant profile on this issue, and of course all the more so since Cyprus is a candidate for membership of the European Union with negotiations at a fairly advanced stage. This naturally raises certain expectations and means that the role of the European Union is of some relevance in this context.	1.3949872656583706
The approach that we have been following in these discussions, and our participation in them, essentially turns on taking advantage of a certain desire to alleviate the tensions that exist, based on a conviction - which appears to be widely shared - that it is necessary to continue to negotiate, and that continuing negotiations and maintaining their impetus also give rise to hopes that a definitive solution can be found.	1.3165423715956364
There is also another important aspect which I referred to at the beginning of my statement, and this relates to Turkey' s role in helping the north of the island to prepare for accession.	1.3511056361750555
We believe that it is not only necessary to read the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council with some care and attention, but that we should also take advantage of the willingness of the Turkish authorities to help to resolve this situation.	1.4728351730454465
I was able to talk to Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit about this issue when I visited Ankara myself, and although we are aware of the difficulties and sensitivity associated with Turkey' s particular approach to this question, I believe that there is a window of opportunity that we must not miss.	1.2944508356795226
This window of opportunity involves combining various factors, one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union.	1.2642061540171863
This is key as regards the future of this issue.	1.1431936455893739
On the other hand, we think it is important - and this is also linked with the way in which the European Union relates to the heart of this matter - that an exchange of information between the Commission and the Cypriots in the north of the island should be encouraged. This would not, let me make this quite clear, imply any kind of formal recognition.	1.4638004065551111
Nevertheless, we believe, and I think this is also how the Commission sees things, that the whole process of approximation with the acquis communautaire with a view to overall integration of the island in the European Union through accession at some point in the future implies involving the communities in the north of the island as soon as possible. It may also give the European Union access to data enabling it to justify accession, as part of its efforts to assess accession conditions.	1.5540958163323997
Furthermore, this means that we in the Council - and I think that Parliament will join us in this - should encourage the Commission' s involvement in this undertaking.	1.5069379319580614
It is essential for us to send the Commission a message of confidence about its role in this area.	1.2139209509058093
Lastly, I believe - and this is also the presidency' s intention - that we should continue to cooperate actively with the United Nations, given the skilful, intelligent and capable way in which the Secretary-General, and the UN organisation in general, have conducted these discussions, and in particular the way they have endeavoured to help to harmonise the two parties' positions.	1.4633025855676813
As I said at the beginning, the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council last December have had a visible impact on the way the positions of the various parties to this process have developed.	1.4128409514533828
The Nicosia Government has expressed its satisfaction with the Helsinki conclusions, which open up the way to accession to the European Union without solving the partition of the island beforehand.	1.2857326190720602
Nevertheless, I have to say that the same authorities have expressed their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issues raised by partition, which will evidently imply some concessions.	1.3142733329301943
This is related to developments in the sphere of displaced people and the possibility of a new arrangement regarding displaced people should a different solution be found for the island.	1.0762332529302558
On the other hand, the Turkish Cypriots fear - and there is no point in trying to conceal this - that Turkey' s application for membership of the European Union may lead to greater flexibility in Ankara' s position on this.	1.3281369568236474
I believe that, despite the fears that may be felt by the two communities on the island, these points, which could be viewed in a negative light by the authorities on both sides, may in the end justify hopes of an ultimate solution.	1.4061727374472224
It is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present, which is the extremely positive trend in relations between Athens and Ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the Greek Foreign Minister, Giorgios Papandreou, and the Turkish Foreign Minister, Ismail Cem.	1.3461878663004914
We believe that this has created the framework for a positive outcome.	1.4063653372485863
As far as we, the Council presidency, are concerned, we will continue to follow these developments very closely, and we will certainly cooperate with the Secretary-General and his personal representative on this matter.	1.6224987723699658
We will make the Community institutions aware of what we are able to do, and what is possible in general, as regards coordination, not just at political level but also as regards what the Commission itself can achieve in terms of its scope for managing the accession process.	1.5458720452105017
In particular, we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue.	1.260415527339879
Mr President, we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations.	1.5610978812732195
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate the sensitivity with which you are addressing the issue and your effort to establish contact with the Turkish Cypriot side, but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use did not leave one suspecting that you might be attempting some kind of indirect recognition, even though you stressed that this is not the case.	1.2315404885919208
For example, I would not refer to the government of Nicosia.	1.5197250045433317
It is the Cypriot Government, Mr President-in-Office, not the government of Nicosia.	1.2278376882678106
That government has proposed a way in which the Turkish Cypriot side can take part, and I think it would be right for the Council and the Commission to urge the Turkish Cypriot side to take part institutionally in the framework of the negotiations conducted by the Republic of Cyprus.	1.4108290872236102
On the other hand, the way that the issue of the end of the protocols and the pre-accession strategy has been addressed so far creates some doubts for us.	1.2926660756155588
I cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently, nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies.	1.0711997590619469
Nor can I understand the pressure applied by Parliament to include the funds in Chapter 7 for the pre-accession strategy. How can the whole of the European Union treat, in this way, two small countries situated on its periphery?	1.3304424149278973
Not only are they countries which the European Union needs, but they are also countries which are fully qualified to operate within the Union and are already considered capable of participating in economic and monetary union.	1.3473526765376955
As the Commissioner said, and I agree with him, it is a matter of political decision.	1.6807876807477573
This is a small political decision which would bring major benefits, especially in helping the two communities effectively to constitute one state, to achieve effective rapprochement - because the two communities were once close - and for the Republic of Cyprus, genuinely, to be rid of occupying forces.	1.5346020633828443
Mr President, we are required under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations within the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta.	1.0235916690392686
This proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and, once it is implemented, will replace the financial protocols which have now expired.	1.2760599271466364
Pre-accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the Community acquis.	1.1366780400717933
The Commission' s analysis has in fact shown that, although classified as high income countries by the World Bank, Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity.	1.165356424082627
It was pointed out, during the discussion of Mr Brok' s excellent report in committee, that both countries can also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest.	1.1953423659913698
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could explicitly confirm that.	0.7375526718946679
As far as Cyprus is concerned, part of the technical and financial aid provided for in the instruments will be used to bring the Greek and Turkish communities closer together and solve the problem of the partition of the island once and for all.	1.1234560571481313
The declarations made on the Cyprus question by the Council and the Commission were therefore most opportune and I should like to thank the President of the Council and Commissioner Verheugen.	1.348438242244709
Since 4 July 1990, when Cyprus applied to join the EU, the European Parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.	1.380760065805272
In April 1999, Parliament again reiterated its position that the accession of Cyprus should benefit the whole island, and help towards a political solution, but that accession should not be dependent upon such a solution.	1.3913388638588617
In other words, accession should not be held hostage to a political solution.	1.0155070530867958
The two processes are separate processes.	0.6806515295245958
This unequivocal position on the part of the European Parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy.	1.1949613765701004
We must therefore welcome the fact that the Helsinki European Council put an end to the speculation and stated in its conclusions, and I quote, that "If no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations, the Council' s decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition" .	1.3775336427463092
The position is clear and we must now hope that the improved climate surrounding relations between the European Union and Turkey and between Greece and Turkey will bear favourably on the Turkish Cypriot community and that it will withdraw its refusal to send representatives to the accession negotiations.	1.3276199853898023
The presence of these representatives will not prejudge the final political solution in any way whatsoever.	1.0159885763597718
On the contrary, it will allow the interests of all concerned to be highlighted as and when Cyprus joins the European Union and prepares for a turning point in its history.	1.3817669677083402
Mr President, I want to say that I share the other rapporteurs' delight at the fact that better opportunities are now to be glimpsed for making further progress in Cyprus in the light of the improvement in relations between Turkey and the EU and between Turkey and Greece.	1.224994936724105
However, I also think that we in the EU should be making a constructive contribution.	1.8603383197576915
I also think - as has already been mentioned - that there are certain problems with the financing arrangements, which we must solve.	1.532555545205756
There is, of course, the question of pre-accession aid, and this belongs in category seven.	1.3329819261563147
Last year, Parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four, and the two applicant States are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant States from Central and Eastern Europe, as they, in fact, should be, according to the declarations from the Helsinki Summit.	1.3584690981641445
Resources should therefore be set aside from category seven, where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out.	1.2005414048336924
This is the crux of the matter.	0.7726729724201338
The main point is that the money for Cyprus' s and Malta' s pre-accession aid should come from category seven and that there should be a review of the financial perspectives for, if the Council does not endorse this view, it is in reality acting in conflict with its own decisions in Helsinki in December.	1.3811964234206189
With regard to the amount which is quoted in the Brok report (EUR 130 million), I also want to say, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, that we must negotiate our way towards finding a sum of money.	1.1584068425840388
The most important thing is that a multi-annual programme be guaranteed, and in the correct category, so that it might be possible to begin making plans where Cyprus and Malta are concerned.	1.217206216139811
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support the decision adopted by the European Council in Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot be a prior condition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.	1.1554127535567698
We should continue to exert strong pressure on the Government of Cyprus, but one section of the population cannot blackmail the wish of the majority. Besides, we have strong doubts as to how representative the government is of that part of the island is.	1.4135860316797344
It is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full.	0.9940203317781644
But we are also convinced that, despite improved relations between the Turkish and Greek populations, it is not enough.	1.3266354863936447
The conflict in Cyprus will only be resolved through improved relations between the two communities with a view to establishing a federation in the - we hope - not too distant future.	1.341313368608456
In particular, we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of demilitarising and disarming the island.	1.157728580925246
The European Union should be taking a more decisive role that goes further than merely providing financial support, although that is important, by promoting and guaranteeing reconciliation between the two communities through the setting up of fora and confidence-building programmes.	1.2837928958171927
I must say that Alex Langer's presence here in the European Parliament is sadly missed. His efforts to build peace should serve as an example, to all of us, on how peaceful coexistence can be achieved.	1.3519996472767668
Mr President, the reference to dialogue between the two Cypriot communities under the aegis of the UNO reminds us of the fact that, 26 years after the invasion of the island by the Turkish army, nearly 40% of the territory is still occupied by 35 000 soldiers, heavy weaponry is still being used and over 50 000 colonists are still present, in total violation of the resolutions by the Security Council of the United Nations on this matter.	1.2214342919652221
What can the European Union do, without interfering in internal affairs in Cyprus, to promote a fair and viable solution to this drastic problem in a country which has been associated with the European Community for nearly 30 years and which is due to join the Union within the next few years?	1.5534792559502992
I have listened to the somewhat equivocal talk and silences on the part of the Council which, in my view, need clarifying.	1.0848383032145072
I think that we need, first and foremost, to bear the main point of reference for any international community in such cases in mind, i.e. the resolutions of the United Nations.	1.3546602510874308
The Security Council feels that the solution to the Cypriot problem should be sought within the framework of a two-zone, twin-community federation, in other words a single state, as Mr Verheugen mentioned, consisting of two local administrations elected by the two communities.	1.2543365133838071
Cyprus should be one sovereign state, with a single international personality and single citizenship and this state should be demilitarised.	1.1750240480045016
The international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force.	0.9728363898836534
Secondly, the European Union stands to gain, in my view, by minimising the scope for interpretation of the position laid down by the Helsinki European Council.	1.337205557003982
The solution to the Cypriot problem cannot be a precondition to Cyprus' s accession to the Union, as Mr Poos has reminded us.	1.167288905546832
If it were, Turkey would have a sort of right of veto over the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, which is, of course, unacceptable.	1.1770573104167594
Thirdly, we must not, in turn, allow the position taken by the Helsinki European Council to temper our efforts to resolve the Cypriot question before Cyprus joins the Union.	1.3132585746829097
From this point of view, the other decision taken at Helsinki, namely to grant Turkey candidate status, gives the Fifteen new responsibilities as well as new possibilities and its dialogue with Ankara can and, in my view, should, include a determination to ensure that Turkey demonstrates a constructive attitude towards dialogue between the two Cypriot communities which respects international law and which will ultimately lead to a united Cyprus and peace in the eastern Mediterranean.	1.2384438460705331
Mr President, there is a general consensus of opinion that financial aid to Cyprus and Malta is important.	1.227199776213259
The big question, however, is from what budget heading should this aid be financed?	1.1530608736768402
The Council and Commission have suggested deleting the protocols under category 4.	1.0593339487872273
This is in line with the budget order issued by Parliament in December last.	1.1251778535551962
The rapporteur is now making reference to this and proposes classing Cyprus and Malta under category 7.	1.0930022396342867
The Committee on Budgetary Control has even suggested postponing approval of the Brok report until the Council agrees to increase the financial ceilings for category 7.	1.055667236931293
This is an extremely risky strategy.	1.1203988423616147
In fact, the financial protocols cannot go ahead without a vote in Parliament.	1.2975585661335938
Cyprus and Malta will thus become the victims of a political game between the Council and Parliament regarding the height of the ceilings.	1.0998071612051221
Moreover, what is the real significance of financial ceilings if they are increased for every new action?	1.349678267719735
I would therefore advocate that the EUR 15 million in category 4 be dropped, in line with the Commission' s proposal.	1.2803741698641837
A multiannual budget of the Commission later on in the year, may give a decisive answer regarding credits for the coming years.	1.3355616040885685
Mr President, all over the world work is being done to resolve long-standing conflicts and bring together communities divided by history and by old tribal enmities and hatreds.	1.231146004122261
Now is the time to devote our time and energy to aiding Cypriots from both sides of the "green line" in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long.	0.9986824651366121
We all know that special care is needed to ensure that Cyprus is brought successfully into the European Union, and the decisions taken at Helsinki give an added dimension to this debate, with the acceptance of Turkey as a candidate country.	1.2943082265571613
I hope that the decisions taken at Helsinki lead to progress on the Cyprus issue.	0.9780610558271451
I hope this signals a new era of hope for Cyprus.	1.0614604065544009
I hope that Turkey begins to play a constructive role in the Cyprus issue.	1.056766299097776
I am delighted to hear the words of support from the Council and the Commission for the UN and the work it is doing in encouraging proximity talks between the two communities to encourage reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between the two communities in Cyprus.	1.2780327918213223
I very much welcome the Commission's support for that bizonal, bicommunal, federal Cyprus for which the UN has campaigned for so long and which both the Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish Cypriot side should be working hard to bring about.	1.2206102012106415
I welcome the renewed warmth in relations between the Greek Government and the Turkish Government.	1.1529374744765868
I hope that has an encouraging effect on the Cyprus talks.	1.2605641448528662
I hope that the accession money available to assist Cyprus is used partly to promote that reconciliation and rebuilding of trust and that both sides of the divided communities in Cyprus accept and use that money in the spirit in which it is given.	1.2163825920436042
We all, throughout the European institutions - in Parliament, the Council and the Commission - should be doing our best to aid Cyprus in its quest to reach a peaceful solution which brings together these two communities which have been divided for too many years.	1.345040541171159
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, the regulation on accession aid is not exactly an advertisement for coherent work on the part of the Commission.	1.1686041015175819
Rather, the way in which these aid measures have been cobbled together smacks of amateurism to me.	0.9684060135130664
This applies both in terms of the substance and the financial aspect.	1.170619661709447
In my view, it will hardly enable us to present the accession activities conducted by the Union to the citizens of Cyprus and Malta as evidence of the fact that it is worth their while joining.	1.3933357689582082
As Vaclav Havel rightly said today, the European Union will be judged on its political qualities according to what it can do for the individual.	1.2674067338560704
As far as the citizens are concerned, it is what a regulation can do for them that matters.	1.5536960956667234
We will not exactly win any awards with this regulation as far as that is concerned.	1.1152539844126448
It is makeshift and contains heteronomous paragraphs, which is no way to set a shining example.	1.2783964697261139
The quality of an aid package is assessed according to the following criteria: is it decentralised, is it transparent, is it accessible to the citizens and does it work?	1.4040563028574713
Nonetheless, as far as the divided island of Cyprus is concerned, overall, this pre-accession strategy is bound up with a major political challenge.	1.5124176499833748
In my view, it is the task of the European Union to employ all instruments, including this one, so as to contribute towards resolving the conflict on the island by political means.	1.3500297602851656
I must take this opportunity to say that it is precisely the amendment submitted by the European Parliament that is so important to me in this respect.	1.430907972393046
Both the Commission and the Council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well.	1.1149171238540907
I am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect.	1.3592951749124398
I believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in Cyprus before admitting this country to the European Union.	1.2013799692983183
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the view of the Greek Communist Party is that the main problem of Cyprus is not its accession to the European Union but the occupation of 40% of its territory by Turkey, which has continued for 26 years.	1.2915800919771045
Regardless of the national origin of each Cypriot, the future of the Cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country.	1.2997305101227759
The only acceptable solution that guarantees the future, that leaves no room for foreign interventions, like those that led to all the problems of the last fifty years, is a unified and federal Cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the UN' s Security Council.	1.4484942770128506
The key to solving the Cyprus problem is in the hands of the Turkish Government, which supports and encourages the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leader Raouf Denktaº.	1.288474990364602
For its part, the European Union, with its hypocritical professions of interest in freedom and human rights, has never been moved by the drama of the Cypriot people, by the problem of Greek and Turkish Cypriot refugees, by the enforced change of the population composition in the north of Cyprus, or by the wholesale settlement of colonists by Turkey in the occupied areas.	1.317158678398656
Even in this Chamber, the Council' s representative referred to the north of Cyprus and not to the occupied territories.	1.4957510246952694
The recent Helsinki decision to grant Turkey accession country status, even though it has made not the slightest concession over the issue of its occupation of Cyprus, for example, by reducing its military presence there or giving back Ammokhostos, is clearly encouraging Turkey' s intransigence.	1.1598156862467561
It is not by chance that, immediately after Helsinki, the Turkish Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit, stated that the Cyprus issue had been resolved in 1974.	1.2679857632228149
Encouraging Turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the UN Secretary General.	1.0946824106957291
On their course towards accession, the people of Cyprus have already lost a great deal, but stand to lose even more.	1.2860363207259058
The application of the acquis communautaire has created serious problems for the Cypriot economy, especially in agriculture. It entails the liquidation of the public sector, and it dislocates and destroys the developed system of social solidarity that exists in Cyprus.	1.25698599758525
Mr President, I beg your pardon, but the French interpreter made a small error, on the most sensitive word in the debate, during the translation of what Mr Alyssandrakis just said.	1.437230836203368
I just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity.	1.1323608183447533
Mr Alyssandrakis was translated as saying "the confederate solution would be best" .	0.8254168191290332
Obviously, he said "the federal solution would be best" .	1.1114393338591344
It is a most important point and needs to be clarified, Mr President.	1.3082642977547245
Thank you very much for the clarification Mr Wurtz.	0.8348227658029332
Mr President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland Europe.	1.2593465517752729
The Maltese in particular have been very good at surviving in hostile geographical and geopolitical environments.	0.9428573568976859
Their success has relied in great part on their enterprise, their dynamism and their flexibility.	0.9537903867667451
Malta has vibrant light and heavy industry, growing financial services, good agriculture, magnificent tourism and an amazing range of employment opportunities, all of this on an island virtually barren of natural resources.	1.1528998379252484
I am certain, therefore, that an island such as Malta, with its population of 340 000 cannot accommodate the rigidities of the economic and legal structures of the mainland which has a population a thousand times greater.	1.33784437553018
Thus, when I look at this proposed instrument I do not see a measure to bring two peoples into the fold of Mother Europe.	1.2159006005285358
The situation is more akin to a black hole in space, sucking in masses so powerfully that not even light escapes.	0.8866623385752813
We should not be bribing these island peoples to cooperate in their own destruction, giving them money to absorb laws which are as alien to their culture as a black hole is to Mother Earth.	1.107369846394288
The EU should leave Cyprus and Malta alone.	1.0525518089041497
It seems to me that the only people in Malta that want this are the political class, and I shall be keeping my fingers crossed that once again the Maltese people are the winners.	1.2208661046438158
Mr President, this is one of the few occasions when, from what the speakers have said in this Parliament, from all sides of the House, there is clearly the greatest convergence of views on the Cyprus issue and, of course, on the pre-accession process for Cyprus and Malta.	1.3772876696244516
This means that we are all aware of the political dimension of the Cyprus problem.	1.318366075174096
At the same time, however, it means that both the Council and the Commission have a very strong mandate, so that the strength of opinion expressed by all the European parties, and all the peoples, can empower their political ability to address the problem.	1.3607481599805897
Helsinki was an historic event, an historic turning-point and an historic new reference point.	1.1707721773176856
If, for any reason, the balance achieved there should be considered by some to be a point of departure for new negotiations anywhere else, if some people destabilise this totality of facts and equilibrium by their attitude, they will be making a tragic mistake.	1.4359921397843234
Conditions are ripe.	0.3261127292192774
What is needed from the European Commission, the Council and everyone else, is a quiet determination, a quiet determination to continue the accession negotiations on both Cyprus and Malta without guile, granted that in the last analysis they are the most mature of all the countries seeking accession, so that this determination can act as a signal to anyone whose view may differ from the view we all agree about.	1.431797147314513
To this end, the Brok report is a good instrument and it is really a bit distressing that, because this is a joint debate, it is politically overshadowed by the political position of the Council and the Commission and we cannot therefore say more about this good report.	1.6099372147177176
In any event, the outcome is in your hands.	1.045225870096623
The outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions, to the extent that we are providing you with options.	1.148682344847029
Now, as regards the Brok report, Cyprus and Malta are the last of the Mediterranean islands, and, unless I am mistaken, the last islands anywhere in Europe which have not acceded to the European Union.	1.3934748443584812
This has a certain semiological value because the Mediterranean and its islands - and I too come from an island - are the area which most of those who come from northern Europe for their summer holidays get to see, as well as the people who live there.	1.350453637173007
From that standpoint, Aphrodite' s island, as Cyprus is known, and the pirates' island, as we islanders say of Malta with great affection, are two jewels which should be welcomed into the European Union without delay.	1.4223784917828768
They have healthy economies, high-level economic relations, and in the final analysis they constitute a testing ground for the European Union' s political will.	1.3231769380692655
In conclusion, since I do not think I need to say much, given the unanimity that exists here, I just want to make one brief remark to the President-in-Office. I think that there are some peculiarities in his position.	1.6611741760721561
I hope there has been an interpretation error, and that he will clarify the matter in his follow-up speech.	1.384260448081263
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your comments very carefully, and in particular to the rather emotional comments about Cyprus, especially in defence of the present legal situation in Cyprus, which the European Union specifically acknowledges by recognising the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.	1.2691842756249982
Mr Wurtz, in no way can it be said that the Council is maintaining an ambiguous silence about this issue: the Council assumes total responsibility for its interpretation of the situation in Cyprus.	1.398793036998983
Moreover, it was this situation and this interpretation which led the Council to take the decision it took in Luxembourg at the end of 1997, when it decided to take the first steps in the accession process for the Republic of Cyprus to join the European Union.	1.4949248907679473
I hope that honourable Members will realise that, regardless of the more or less emotional statements made about issues of this kind, the day-to-day reality of international negotiations normally forces governments to adopt a somewhat more flexible stance - and when I say governments I mean all governments.	1.303509694990165
In fact we need more emotional statements to remind us that all these issues have a human side.	1.2974002309333663
But we also need to be aware that it is by virtue of rational political stances, and flexibility in negotiations, that we are able to find solutions to the major disputes which have ultimately led to many tragedies in history.	1.3460048398445232
Regardless of who is to blame - and we are not here to apportion blame, the relevant United Nations resolutions in this area are clear enough - I believe that we should take advantage of the opportunities that the new situation is opening up, in more of a rational way and less of an emotional one.	1.579676990181595
The European Council in Helsinki had the courage to take certain decisions, and I believe that various aspects of these decisions have already recognised the real value of these opportunities which, as I said at the beginning of my first speech, represent a window of opportunity.	1.2893243669038537
We will not achieve concrete results during this stage of negotiations, which is a delicate and sensitive phase, by exploiting tensions.	1.3546538057640591
No, we should continue to make progress by working discreetly to support the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with his remit.	1.2068069979748326
The European Union' s position on this is crystal clear, and I do not think it is worthwhile second-guessing particular phrases in the Council' s conclusions or in any other statement.	1.3783426746129386
We do not play at political correctness in this House: we are concerned with fairness at international level and with concrete statements on this issue consistently defined by the Council over a period of time, and which the European Commission has also followed carefully, attentively and pragmatically.	1.4713921740203508
So when we talk now about the need to involve the Northern Cyprus community in exchanges of information, particularly with a view to the eventual accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, we need to be aware that we are trying to find practical formulas that will enable us to overcome the obstacles standing in the way of a political solution.	1.243510547243872
We are not trying to deceive anyone and we are in no way trying to use practical solutions to create a model implying political recognition.	1.3011543635957479
I believe that, over time, the Council of the European Union has clearly demonstrated that this is not how it sees this issue.	1.7941626427724937
Decisions have been taken by the Council with a great sense of responsibility.	1.333681560844939
We believe that Helsinki was very clear in this respect.	1.0484189501335435
The authorities of the Republic of Cyprus itself have clearly recognised that our relations with them regarding their accession to the European Union have been positive.	1.21806640106727
There is no point in second-guessing or trying to second-guess our intentions.	0.9235662303508017
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all very much indeed for this debate, which all in all I have found to be encouraging and supportive, and it has also shown that there is a great deal of support in this House for the policy of the Member States and that of the Commission.	1.5085826160151576
However, I would be more than pleased to elucidate a few points as requested.	1.4852195310004979
I will turn firstly to matters pertaining to headings 4 and 7. It is quite simple: a special heading, namely, the famous heading 7, was created in Berlin, as part of the large Agenda 2000 package, for the applicant countries of Eastern and Central Europe, which are currently undergoing a process of transformation, and for these countries alone.	1.4645717208112783
Malta, Cyprus and Turkey were not provided for at this stage.	0.9479904937594598
Mrs Schroedter described this as a lack of coherence.	0.8283120202940534
She ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council, who is not exactly a stranger to you, how this presumed lack of coherence has come about.	1.1255995570899364
I have had a little to do with this too.	1.3796871385813494
I do not believe this to be the case. The reason for this decision was, rather, that we wanted to have a special instrument for the Eastern and Central European States which, like Malta and Cyprus, are involved in the accession process, but under different conditions.	1.588864722921179
Nevertheless, I have said that I understand the arguments that people have been putting forward here and the Commission will endeavour to take account of these aspirations, but since this is all about Agenda 2000 and the Financial Perspective, we will not be able to do this without amending this Financial Perspective.	1.73758129841506
Hitherto this has been out of the question of course.	1.1755536822106836
By way of clarification: if we transfer it across from heading 4 to heading 7 then this will have no effect on the overall balance of the budget.	1.1697700561805169
If we do this, then heading 7 would be increased accordingly but heading 4 would be decreased by the same amount.	1.2647591543018522
The idea that heading 7 could be added to in this way and heading 4 left alone, is not workable.	1.326059791043577
Parliament is no more able than anyone else to spend money that it has not got, at least not until we have a printing machine installed in the basement that we can use to print euro notes!	1.3847219617601487
As for the peace process in Cyprus and how it is linked with the accession negotiations, I would reiterate that there has always been a direct connection between the two.	1.3830658743392639
The Commission and the Council have long endeavoured to encourage the two communities in Cyprus to undertake joint projects.	1.120523996727031
So far, as you know, this has proved unsuccessful, and I have been asked if there have been any signs to the contrary.	1.4872240423618832
Mrs Rothe, I would put it this way: I am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind.	1.488633090420692
I do not have confirmation of this at present, and nor do I expect it, since we have not yet held direct talks.	1.5714720182058983
These will take place at a later date.	1.03424389219887
The framework conditions have changed in that the Helsinki decisions made a whole range of things possible that were not possible hitherto, and, above all, in that the political strategies employed by the parties concerned have changed beyond recognition.	1.3194426842160227
I have always believed that the old line - i.e. not to admit Cyprus under any circumstances until the political conflict has been resolved - has a weak point in that it does not provide the Turkish community on Cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves, for, with this strategy, the Turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait.	1.4704727492062042
There would then be no question of Cyprus acceding to the Union.	1.1445220052081544
As matters stand, Turkey has to take seriously the fact that there is a risk of Cyprus being integrated into the European Union, and this would provide opportunities for prosperity and security for the Greek community whilst the Turkish community, whose level of prosperity is already far lower, would fall even further behind.	1.372597374444802
Therefore, it is my firm belief that, since Helsinki, there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict.	1.495133514092681
Indeed that was the idea behind it.	1.00904039856608
After only a few weeks, Mrs Rothe, it is still too early to deliver a verdict on this, but in any case, I have no grounds for assuming that the new line will fail.	1.4534045963591056
As yet, we have no grounds for saying that we will actually succeed, but one thing I can say quite clearly is that the conditions that need to be in place for us to take a step forwards have improved considerably.	1.5779785822356815
Finally, of course, the Cyprus question has a role in the discussions with Turkey.	1.4430838160437305
I met the Turkish Foreign Minister in Brussels a few weeks ago and naturally I asked if Turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue.	1.0683517225204413
I would just make one point: we cannot be 100% sure - I am not at any rate - that one only has to press a button in Ankara to set the wheels in motion in Cyprus.	1.4906998276410355
It is very far from being that simple, rather we are going to have to make concentrated efforts, during talks with both communities, to encourage them to reach an understanding.	1.483285053338677
That is what we intend to do: the necessary measures and programmes are in place.	1.255065452572238
I must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation, the one that has yet to be decided on here, before we can even get started.	1.551873331612715
The financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus.	1.2833112159576687
I cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place, because I lack the legal basis for doing so.	1.297677703576538
If the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point, then I am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that.	1.32619439694566
This legal framework is fleshed out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the Commission and the Council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management.	1.217697264356163
On the contrary, I would say that, although many areas of European policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence, in this instance I would claim, on behalf of the Commission and the Council, that we have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy.	1.4673021749270594
. (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, now that the Commissioner has explained to us, in an extremely coherent manner, that the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council and his Minister of State for Europe bore responsibility for the lack of coherence, perhaps you could help the Commissioner and ourselves, so as to enable us to take this decision.	1.2294453205665767
It would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the Financial Perspective up until 2004 and on heading B7, or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence, which is something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission.	1.3801102937455145
. (PT) Mr President, I am sure that the issue raised by my friend Elmar Brok will be considered by the Council.	1.0611980587859928
I feel that the criticism made of the previous presidency is not appropriate.	1.352813849585191
I believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent, regardless of who was involved in that work.	1.1826209332803903
In any case, the question that this raises is an important one and the Council will not fail to support the proposals that the Commission has presented in this respect.	1.5756035963203239
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as I understood it, Mr Brok was actually referring to an earlier presidency still.	1.102664531178985
Mr President, I asked Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument MEDA but he has not provided an answer.	1.2872448206834768
I would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us.	1.2747893093811593
Forgive me Mr Poos.	0.28745423965620615
There was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me.	0.9902859431139407
This is how matters stand with regard to MEDA: Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programmes, but not in the country-specific ones, because the incomes are too high.	1.3139697022068808
Thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen.	0.8949357156121014
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place on Thursday.	0.48365152987030724
Question Time (Council)	0.3763026442786636
Question No 1 by (H-0022/00):	0.6870001537867473
Subject: Controlling access to Community waters for oil tankers In connection with the accident involving the oil tanker ERIKA off the French coast, which produced a large oil slick, what steps does the Council intend to take to control access to Community waters for tankers flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards?	1.245647817702208
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika.	1.0983105214824036
At that time, bearing in mind the strength of public feeling about the disastrous consequences of this accident, the Council made known its concerns about the safety of oil tankers and the environmental protection that should go hand in hand with it.	1.140304069874428
The Council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field.	1.3345809089555745
It emphasised the importance of the Council taking new measures within a Community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations.	1.434246422329828
As you know, as currently framed, Community legislation requires port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign vessels, including those flying flags of convenience, and to detain them if they do not comply with international standards.	1.3039377742225102
There is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject.	1.094468530677766
With regard to the future, the Council noted that work within the Commission should shortly lead to the publication of a communication on the safety of oil tankers and of new proposals to strengthen controls, together with provisions on the qualifications of inspecting agencies.	1.3652144738501144
There are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting Community ports.	1.0957724081493982
These dossiers will be progressed by the Transport Council and I can therefore assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we will not fail to give the highest priority to the proposals, which there is every indication the Commission is due to present in this area, which we regard as being a vital part of environmental protection.	1.5313827832331415
This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure.	1.3515659628979606
I am pleased that the Council is considering this question.	1.2961196157803547
The President of the Council comes from a country, Portugal, which is directly at risk from just this type of situation.	1.384802783542809
If we stretched our imaginations, we could envisage a situation where, between now and next summer, an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstances off the Algarve, wreck the Portuguese summer tourist industry, with a bit of luck the sea currents would carry the pollution towards the island of Madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore, wreck tourism in the Canary Islands as well.	1.3839766903275157
Does the President of the Council not think that we should stop talking and implement tough measures in this area, bearing in mind that we now have the means to control this type of oil tanker on the high seas?	1.4126525440866438
Of course, the story of the Erika seems comical.	1.211889377005266
A French-owned ship, under a Maltese flag of convenience, an Indian crew, a sea-worthiness certificate issued by Italy, in Sicily, with the last inspection carried out in Bulgaria, I think.	1.4751397961728911
The ship was sinking and the captain realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port.	1.4268118419490008
This kind of situation should not be allowed.	0.971168780764187
The damage to your country, Mr President, and to mine, Spain, could be horrendous.	1.4531892700875688
Mr Medina Ortega, I naturally share your concerns and I can assure you that a coastal country like my own, the country currently holding the presidency, is naturally very concerned about this issue, all the more so as it does not have any oil tankers of its own.	1.4226512501832351
However, we have to work within the existing legislative framework.	1.412953817068516
That legislative framework is the 1995 directive, which has a set of regulations with a degree of flexibility which should perhaps be implemented more rigorously.	1.1637339616915088
In this area we have to work with the world as it is, and that means reacting in accordance with the facts of the situation.	1.5245372351769004
In view of the seriousness of such situations, we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authorities have at least reacted and undertaken to examine the legislative provisions already existing in this field.	1.2373100529142644
The Commission' s intentions in this area are positive, as it intends to reinforce the application of the 1995 directive.	1.5090522362176069
The Council is minded to give priority to this area, within the Transport Council, and we intend to follow this up as quickly as possible.	1.4055026593041178
We also hope that the European Parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal promptness when it comes before this House under the codecision procedure.	1.2243541884436397
Mr President, in Kotka, in Finland, there is currently a vessel carrying chemicals, which is sailing under a flag of convenience.	1.4288952319246015
The vessel is anchored outside the port, as the condition it is in is a safety hazard for the port and the surrounding areas, and because it cannot be inspected properly, as there is no one who will pay.	1.4769774437411525
Would it be possible for the EU to create a standardised inspection system that would also guarantee payment, out of Community funds, for the inspection of ships that fly a flag of convenience and cannot themselves pay the cost?	1.2157107574814194
- (PT) Mrs Korhola, as you will understand, I do not at the moment have the information I need to give you a concrete reply.	1.4142397596944452
The information that I have is to do with the 1995 directive, which does not include any provisions of that kind.	1.2546402504263854
However, the Council will certainly let you have a concrete reply on the options available for acting in the case you have mentioned.	1.5790866609680367
Question No 2 by (H-0024/00):	0.7775566596193072
Subject: High infant mortality levels in Kosovo According to the most recent UN information forwarded to the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe. About 50% of premature babies do not survive and the war has resulted in a massive increase in the number of miscarriages.	1.0363194385339154
Even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped.	0.6303829717780925
In view of the humanitarian aid being given by the European Union and the efforts being made by the head of the interim administration, Mr Bernard Kouchner, what measures will the Council take to defend the rights of the women of Kosovo to motherhood and to protect the health of pregnant women, women in confinement and new-born children?	1.217412644171147
Mr President, Mrs Karamanou' s question is an extremely serious one, and I would not wish to conceal that fact.	1.5392485386499193
We are perfectly aware of the difficult and dramatic humanitarian situation in Kosovo and of the problem of displaced people in that region - and I mean people who originate from Kosovo - and of the particular effect of this on child health and on mortality rates.	1.402229549415855
I think it is well known that the European Union has made a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid effort being made by the international community.	1.3000074478707067
As you know, the European Community has contributed a total of EUR 378 million for the province of Kosovo alone, and this has to be seen in conjunction with the contributions made by Member States at national level.	1.4145190416519844
This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification.	0.9827507892919569
Furthermore, as you know, the European Union makes a contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which came to EUR 66.3 million in 1999.	1.3474104613550733
I think that Mrs Karamanou is aware that, because of the need for division of labour between the international donors, the task of restoring health care in Kosovo has been entrusted to the World Health Organisation.	1.2634542070339643
The reports produced by the WHO indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation, and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and general hospitals.	1.1177623633054736
Nevertheless, we are aware that this situation is far from a satisfactory solution and that there are widespread repercussions in other areas of health care, apart from child health.	1.294909567734366
This is not just a technical situation, it is a political situation, and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation, because there are aspects to this, and we may as well be open about this, which are associated with the international community' s inability up to now to make a multi-ethnic society function in Kosovo, with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region.	1.532100880735895
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for your answer which supplements what Commissioner Patten said yesterday on the subject.	1.0372262069337361
Yet, the sum of EUR 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999, was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even rudimentary civilised conditions in Kosovo, especially where the provision of health services is concerned.	1.2534027165679917
Mr President-in-Office, do you not think that the very fact of increased child mortality is an abomination for the continent of Europe, a shameful thing, which should motivate us all, so that the aid we provide becomes more effective and more generous?	1.2764763226533882
Of course, the situation was not idyllic, even before the bombardments, anything but, I should say. However, since NATO' s intervention, there has been a very clear deterioration in the natural and human environment.	1.5299056921343799
So, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised conditions for the long-suffering inhabitants of Kosovo, and above all, keep our promises to them?	1.2403764210417338
Mrs Karamanou, I recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in Kosovo in this field have not been enough.	1.6947738762221662
I do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that.	1.0763514057941468
I do not want to link this question with your comments about the period "before" and "after" NATO' s intervention, as we will probably touch on that issue at another point during this Question Time.	1.2096093146635718
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the European Union is aware that the resources it has devoted to Kosovo reflect the financial limitations it has to work within.	1.3722822426715624
We have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community.	1.1645953498054784
The European Union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role, but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were, as you have said yourself, Mrs Karamanou, not the best before the military action in Kosovo.	1.4854022704800816
What is more, I do not believe, Mrs Karamanou, that the military action in Kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation.	1.3976282440091443
The present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations, and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in Kosovo' s administration.	1.0907866407033027
This is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole.	1.3540865152171586
And if we cannot solve the political problem, which must be done in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolution, then we will not solve the problem of child health, nor the various other problems faced by this region.	1.384370943855785
I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica.	1.4104116706573975
In cooperation with Europe, the international community rebuilt the hospital there too, but it is located in the northern part of the city, thus prohibiting access to Albanian Kosovars.	1.2498718440684806
This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars.	1.0105452644338142
This is also happening elsewhere in the country, causing tension between the Albanian Kosovars and Serbs, making for a situation where nobody trusts anybody anymore and where Albanians do not want to be looked after by Serbs and vice versa.	1.20142953089017
I understand very well what you are saying and you are right: the European Union should work in a wider context of international cooperation.	1.3778845053955953
But where will you place the emphasis?	0.7035785785341916
What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital, including that in Mitrovica?	1.1221302215518028
Mr Staes, the situation in Mitrovica is well known.	1.349666770005516
This is a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of Kosovo.	1.0085973599688205
I perfectly understand Mr Staes' s concerns.	0.6036076356285742
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Bernard Kouchner' s work in this area has aimed to comply with the objectives of the relevant United Nations resolution, in an attempt to create multi-ethnic facilities which can serve the various communities, including the various aspects of the administration.	1.2901180695237395
I believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible, because there are various protagonists involved.	1.2510530805907096
The situation in Mitrovica is appalling, and involves very special tensions, and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed.	1.4083335777178758
Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals.	1.3913762748703267
Question No 3 by (H-0027/00):	0.7626163926206575
Subject: Indictment of NATO before War Crimes Tribunal Human rights organisations, such as the US Human Rights Watch, have already collected significant evidence of NATO crimes in connection with the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia with a view to bringing a case before the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.	1.1950069295989092
On the basis of this evidence, some of which has already been lodged with the Tribunal, NATO is accused of 'serious violations of international humanitarian law' and 'wilful murder'.	1.1374212697776063
Does the Council consider that such accusations should be put before the War Crimes Tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation?	1.0059223162201858
In the event of a judicial inquiry into the accusations against NATO, what will be done in respect of the High Representative for the CFSP, who was NATO Secretary-General during the crisis?	1.3643130259992307
Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed?	0.9909275295264607
Mr President, Mr Alavanos' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues.	1.1646828624216428
The Council has already, on various occasions, stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by NATO were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions.	1.1382888544418512
I am aware that there may be different views about NATO' s action and the legitimacy of that action.	1.1068091411919352
Everyone is free to hold such views.	0.6769597493355195
In my own country, the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter.	1.0132551979375786
That was how it was.	0.5850271672263284
In any case, the Council' s position is clear in that it considers that the objective of the air campaign carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo caused by the Belgrade regime.	1.2155449311497648
This objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April.	1.0715360407857362
I must say that these NATO measures were not taken lightly and were only carried out as a last resort when it became evident that all avenues for reaching a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the Belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces in order to expel the Kosovo Albanians from their land.	1.0033116048996096
I am sure you are aware, Mr Alavanos, that, during her recent visit to NATO headquarters, Prosecutor Del Ponte stressed that the International Tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it, including those made against NATO, in particular by pacifist groups from Canada.	1.26602720407562
This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted.	0.9475685990570227
In any case, I have with me a statement made by Prosecutor Del Ponte according to which NATO is not at present under any investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning NATO' s actions in the Kosovo conflict.	1.3496558142400457
All information received during the past six months, either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of NATO' s actions during the Kosovo conflict, have been recorded by the Prosecutor.	1.1475570997616222
Any other information will of course be analysed by the Prosecutor, who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action.	1.1645529843779998
Until that time Prosecutor Del Ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of criminality made against NATO.	0.8770134450137967
I thank the President-in-Office but I do not agree with him that the purpose of NATO' s intervention was to stop a humanitarian disaster, because we have a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo today, we have the hell of Milosevic, followed by the hell of the KLA and the NATO forces.	1.312324162195724
If the President-in-Office has noticed, almost half the questions he has had to answer today relate to Kosovo.	1.1504037942042142
Despite this, he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the War Crimes Tribunal against NATO after applications by Canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question.	1.0441975280945128
My question, which the President-in-Office did not answer, is this: if this inquisition procedure begins, in which the main or, if you will, one of the main people interrogated and probably found guilty will be Mr Solana, who is today the High Representative of the European Union' s Common Foreign and Security Policy, should it not be, if that happens, if the General Prosecutor of the Tribunal is determined to begin the process, that Mr Solana' s status is suspended at least until it is shown that his hands are clean?	1.4453106226143537
Mr Alavanos, if an action of this kind should be brought against NATO and if this action were to be brought against Mr Javier Solana personally, we would have to bear in mind that Mr Javier Solana held one post at that time and is holding a different one today.	1.4211402314512918
The duties that he exercises today have nothing whatsoever to do with the duties that he exercised during his time as Secretary-General of NATO.	0.9537551129875352
In the absence of any corresponding indication from any international judicial body which could justify any personal accusation against Mr Javier Solana - and there is no sign of this whatsoever - the European Union will not of course make any statement at all on this matter.	1.209636287891075
Mr President, I believe Mr Alavanos is getting NATO and Mr Milosevic mixed up.	1.240637075607507
Mr Milosevic should be appearing before the war crimes tribunal and we should be awarding NATO the Sakharov prize.	0.955037851072501
But I have a quite different question for the Council.	1.4546713571513694
How do matters stand in Kosovo with regard to the rebuilding of the administration, the judiciary and, most importantly of all, the police force?	1.4243863948184672
You mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done.	1.0245888451801557
Rapid action is called for!	0.6525785343082618
First of all, I would like to say that I agree with the priorities you have identified concerning personal responsibility, Mr Posselt.	1.2159964528713014
With regard to the judicial structure in Kosovo, we have already heard Mr Kouchner, on various occasions, describe the enormous difficulties he is experiencing in setting up administrative machinery and a judicial structure.	1.2752715587308283
As you know, the first steps were taken some months ago.	1.283916656617319
We are all aware of the difficulties, and particularly the financial difficulties, that Mr Kouchner is facing in setting up this administrative machinery, and, in particular, we are aware of the special difficulty involved in recruiting police so as to ensure day-to-day public safety.	1.3670703926336978
This is a responsibility that the European Union takes very seriously, Mr Posselt, and I would like to mention that, at the General Affairs Council held on Monday, this issue was repeatedly stressed when we were discussing Kosovo.	1.5836120623445742
Statements were made and pressure was brought to bear on the various Member States who have undertaken to make police resources available to honour their commitments.	1.0938869399226283
Some Member States are taking refuge in the fact that they have provided military forces and that they cannot send the police forces, to which they committed themselves, as quickly as they would like.	1.488091498472096
We are certainly very much aware that this factor is seriously compromising Mr Kouchner' s work and the normalisation of administrative structures in Kosovo, especially as regards judicial structures and police cover.	1.176445938587177
This is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter-ethnic coordination, and we are all conscious that, if measures are not taken in the short term, we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago, and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of Kosovo.	1.4575630074368906
This is obviously a question which really has to be seen in a NATO context, but, as the European Union shares NATO' s view of these issues, it is not difficult for us to associate ourselves with this. I would like to make this clear on behalf of the Council, so that there can be no doubt.	1.528409988137986
Mr Marset Campos, you will be aware, first of all, of how difficult it is to select targets during a military operation, particularly an air-based one, and you will also be aware that there is a category of targets that, whilst they are not military targets as such, are infrastructure targets selected with a view to hindering the smooth running of the military machine.	1.410592533579264
We are of course entering a grey area here, and you may say, Mr Marset Campos, that these are civilian targets, such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure, whilst others will tell me that they are military targets, because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by Mr Milosevic' s forces in Kosovo.	1.345548744456801
So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets.	1.061760040355093
Unfortunately, and as everyone recognised during the military action in Kosovo, there were civilian sectors, and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public, and even inhabited areas, which were directly affected by NATO air attacks.	1.5613502395295986
This is generally recognised and this happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war was not a clean war, nor a model war, but a war based on the art of the possible.	1.4358846759694992
And, above all, it was a necessary war, and it was not only about what was possible, it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community.	1.4546938569720649
Mr Marset Campos, regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight, if you take no action yourself - I believe that, if we look at what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to, and the continuation of that impunity, then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light.	1.4071213472754294
Question No 4 by (H-0028/00):	0.7753425151220945
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Council taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	0.9057724330010885
Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	0.5841436848913565
Mr President, I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer.	1.3210820617567276
Nevertheless, I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when, ultimately, there is in fact a major tripartite relationship.	1.4323957467545865
We provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place, in order to help Armenia, and still the aid cannot come into play because Turkey has imposed an economic blockade, and so many things cannot get through to the Armenians at all.	1.3109819129285682
We are negotiating with Turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the Union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a Member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours.	1.2780496616807795
Can you not exert greater influence over Turkey, so as to enable there to be peaceful developments in this region, and so as to enable Armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front?	1.3464837040183861
- (PT) Mrs Schleicher, you are quite right to say that we should use our relationship with Turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and, particularly, that it becomes part of the solution rather than part of the problem.	1.4284956252661973
We feel that precisely because Turkey has embarked on a new type of relationship with the European Union, and also because Turkey now has to respond to the European Union' s positions on common foreign and security policy issues, we will, to be frank, be testing Turkey' s will as regards the European Union' s priorities in its foreign relations.	1.4655995213611872
Our relationship with Armenia, as evinced by the agreement we signed with that country last year, is of course one element in these foreign relations.	1.2956282099541268
We also feel that, if Turkey wishes to move towards sharing the fundamental values of the European Union and the general framework of the European Union' s relations, regardless of whatever special bilateral conditions may apply to its own relations with any other country, it must in general act in accordance with the basic standards demonstrated by the European Union in its foreign relations.	1.4602489148924684
We are, moreover, convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future.	1.2042240566483315
Question No 6 by (H-0122/00):	0.6870635923179379
Subject: Ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo Since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU aimed at preventing the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians by Serbia, and since the arrival of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200 000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 murdered, constituting ethnic cleansing on a larger scale than that carried out by the Serbs themselves.	1.137260683705431
During the last few days we have seen Serbs murdered by Kosovar Albanian Mafia-type groups, also with impunity.	1.2020908149210217
What decision will the Council adopt to put an end, once and for all, to this ethnic cleansing and to guarantee respect for the human rights of the whole population of Kosovo, irrespective of race or creed?	1.394830056348309
I thank the Minister for his response, but I would also like to point out that, statistically, there is now more violence in Kosovo than there was before the NATO bombing.	1.3599266498936131
It is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation, and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of NATO and the European Union to take such action.	1.388681545953074
I agree with what the Minister very rightly said about the culpability of Belgrade, but we should also remember that the secret services of the USA, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have been supplying arms and money to the KLA, a mafia, which has contributed to the problems in the area.	1.4176252697514855
We are therefore all to blame.	1.155160990470217
I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context.	1.1797346296879605
Do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia?	1.1308488449152665
Mr President, I am no friend of Milosevic or his government.	1.148039204034837
Nevertheless I have the gravest doubts about the legitimacy of Nato's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, both in terms of the lack of authority from the UN Security Council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on Serbia's sovereignty at Rambouillet.	1.1673994400151522
The current situation in Kosovo, which is now ethnically cleansed of Serbs and Roma, speaks for itself.	1.20460794361395
Should Nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the Belgrade TV tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists, which remains a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our Western leaders?	1.106179382524293
Mr Tannock, with regard to the position adopted by the European Union, we do not have selective interpretations and analyses of what were military objectives, and in particular of the initiatives taken against certain types of infrastructure that were propping up Mr Milosevic' s political system and acting as propaganda for him.	1.2227681160194963
I cannot therefore tell you whether we agreed or not on a specific action carried out by NATO, but it was part of an overall plan with which we do agree.	1.3574626911255516
Some of these actions might have been questionable, and some were regarded as unfortunate by NATO itself, but others were justified for tactical reasons, with the aim of preventing Mr Milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former Yugoslavia.	1.258823771060356
In any event, I, on behalf of the Council, do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carried out by NATO.	1.211226182784248
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, since I know the history of the Balkans, I should like to remind you that, for many decades, the peoples of Yugoslavia lived in peace.	1.2595695404167158
Destabilisation began around ten years ago with the break-up of Yugoslavia, in which the European Union played a decisive part.	1.1975842064943523
Yugoslavia' s crime was that it was the only Balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union.	1.232017095931657
So whatever remained standing after the air attacks is now being destroyed by the supposedly disarmed KLA, under the very nose of KFOR, whose role as an occupying force is becoming increasingly apparent.	1.0991994429748517
Every day, new crimes come to light against non-Albanian speakers and against the cultural heritage of Kosovo, and there are hundreds of violations of the UN' s Resolution 1244.	1.2622804709034665
In my opinion, the best thing the Council could do would be to cease occupying that part of Yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides, with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another, independent country.	1.3402759868745224
I respect your understanding and knowledge of the Balkan region, Mr Alyssandrakis, but I find it difficult, quite frankly, to understand how respecting the characteristics of the region can, in terms of political stability, be a solution to the problem.	1.5209649328048314
If we look at the democratic stability of the region, it could perhaps be said that it was the break-up of Yugoslavia that caused the current situation, but let us not get involved in interpreting an international development.	1.3671042041826829
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Yugoslavia was what it was, in the sense that the state managed to harmonise some of its people' s ethnic differences to a degree. It must be pointed out that it did this at a time when its political framework was far from ideal in terms of being democratically representative.	1.350999916618082
The division of Yugoslavia is probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept, regardless of the mistakes that may have been made along the way.	1.2687771929480298
We do not feel that withdrawing international forces now would be any kind of solution. Quite the contrary, it would be a solution leading to calamity.	1.1646317701584852
Mr President, I was a little disappointed with the answer given by the President-in-Office to my colleague.	1.4113139493063904
It is very important, if we stress that Europe is to be a Europe of values, that we do not go down the road of saying that means justify ends.	1.5840069651538877
If civilian targets were targeted and destroyed, killing civilians is illegal by anyone's standards.	0.7562409324339388
It should not be defended even by those of us who deeply deplore the Milosevic regime.	0.9360916931973859
That, however, is not my question.	1.377676975147099
My question is about political prisoners held in Serbia now.	0.9437044813624064
There are, I believe, around 5 000 Kosovar political prisoners held in Serbia at the moment.	0.9708882909324275
My question to the President-in-Office is twofold.	1.0764114140675736
Firstly, is the Council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners?	1.4535143775442718
Secondly, what does it propose to do about them?	1.5954297091029002
Mr MacCormick, first of all, I would like to answer your comments.	1.0189009971543697
I did not defend attacks on civilians.	0.7395366370605643
What I said and what I explained in a previous answer is that there are civilian targets linked with structures which are objects for military action, and you know as well as I do that some military actions not only go for military targets, but also for civilian targets and structures which are connected with military action.	1.2899552404512429
What is a legitimate target is obviously a grey area.	0.9425085981591198
As I said, we are not making value judgements about specific actions.	1.1402226907372897
We are making an overall value judgement about NATO' s action, and this overall value judgement is positive. We agree with the general view of NATO' s action.	1.3773735809375771
With regard to political prisoners in Serbia, Mr MacCormick, it is obvious that, when I say that in Serbia today Mr Milosevic is not acting in accordance with the rules of a decent society at international level, I am referring specifically, not just to the way he acts towards his fellow citizens. I am also referring to the way Mr Milosevic treats political prisoners, and the way he attacks democratic rights and the opposition' s rights of access to the media, and to his attacks on the facilities that should be granted to non-governmental organisations, particularly those protecting human rights.	1.522472855695248
In spite of everything, all this represents only one of many kinds of highly pernicious action perpetrated by Mr Milosevic on Yugoslavian society, and the European Union is of course inevitably concerned about this situation.	1.3277379917577323
This is precisely why the European Union is maintaining all its sanctions until Yugoslavia' s behaviour on the international stage reflects the values that we have to defend.	1.3682194453615417
Question No 7 by (H-0035/00):	0.7674277838253011
Subject: Drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	1.0159392149804263
What are the Council's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	0.6850199870107877
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)?	0.9128498302866469
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	0.7550903031848539
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	0.6081512802432385
What are the Council's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	0.6834370251050784
I thank the President-in-Office for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work.	1.0965007529326074
You will understand, Mr President-in-Office, that there was a point to my question, because the Council is a political body of the European Union and the citizens of Europe, men and women, want to know how it views the democratic and social model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	1.2435649419508772
As a supplementary question, I should like to ask you whether, as the Portuguese Presidency, you have made provision for the rights of children, as such, to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the Charter.	1.5652898170267968
As I said, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.1170236257375978
This procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group, and the matter will only be submitted to the Council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter.	1.4078801717079565
I would nevertheless like to say, with regard to the rights of the child, that we consider this to be an extremely topical issue, particularly for the Council of Europe and in view of the existence of a set of relevant international texts to which we have signed up.	1.4270346997400076
This matter should form part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.6112981757348745
This will certainly be the guideline that my government for one will advocate for the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.8818878222736416
Furthermore, we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposals that we have on this issue.	1.5272666103019399
I do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not.	1.1319172592662894
I presume, however, that this is not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bringing together the currently agreed corpus of rights, which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be included in the charter and be shared by the Union as a whole.	1.2671149442653056
I would remind Members that, according to the guidelines for these sittings, questions must be concise and be worded in a way which will allow a brief answer.	1.2654391917884962
You know that there is a Parliamentary delegation chaired by Mr Méndez de Vigo and a Committee on Constitutional Affairs where these issues can be debated at great length.	1.1638934330201816
I therefore ask that both questions and answers be very brief.	1.084989872273747
Otherwise, we would be in a way undermining the whole process of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.4091046228192954
I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything, but I must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers.	1.2381481581861313
Mr Rübig has the floor.	0.8215756831469078
Mr President, fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions on another Member State, because a democratically elected government was formed there.	1.300069707483966
Both parties were once part of the government.	0.9187489477259897
So far there have been no infringements of the law.	0.9196850056652782
Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights?	0.8725342248048961
Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council, in respect of the formation of national governments, be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	1.028456381388823
Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	0.6506100694377708
Mr Rübig, as President-in-Office, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union was adopted bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union.	1.3014338327395913
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States was actually a set of actions of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level. We feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which, although it has become part of a European Union government, does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the Union' s aims.	1.344742368326354
I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency, because my government intervened at the request of, and in conjunction with, fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity.	1.4564554009483468
Mr President, I have the honour of being a member of the Convention drafting the Charter so I am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the Convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force.	1.264042975303909
What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up?	1.3190183815481649
Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document?	1.4174312858394644
Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter?	1.111675806277844
- (PT) The answer is neither yes nor no.	1.0415697790540028
I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council.	1.5901202703473545
Question No 8 by (H-0042/00):	0.6187148405039865
Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits.	1.0703412319034988
These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects.	0.9117826011223027
Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process?	0.7410089849144188
The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.	0.9684906273548226
The World Bank has decided not to fund the project, which will displace 20 000 Kurds, potentially limit the fresh water supply to Syria and Iraq and cause ecological damage.	1.1375813277246931
What is the Council's view of the involvement of European governments and companies in this project?	1.3118152302774033
The process of agreeing these common standards may have started as long ago as 1978 but clearly the fact that the British Government appears to be going ahead with a massively environmentally damaging project suggests that it has not been very successful so far.	1.0970545609202973
I wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by EU companies in the EU applicant countries.	1.1616232900640444
I ask this because of the issue of coherence, the subject of this morning' s discussion.	1.278053932894284
On the one hand we ask applicant countries to take on board the environmental acquis and yet, at the very same time, the EU Member States are supporting and encouraging investment in those countries which is itself hugely environmentally damaging.	1.3667177497544927
Can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant countries has featured in any of the discussions to date to which you have been referring?	1.241782234999553
- (PT) Mrs Lucas, I was not present at the debate you are referring to.	1.2879827157003896
I would like to say that the Council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing, at a later date.	1.2634936909160668
Question No 9 by (H-0044/00):	0.6195952257521357
Subject: Environmental problems caused by the Drogheda Port Company development project, and the role of the Court of Auditors A major conflict between environmental conservation and structural development interests has arisen in the area of the Boyne Estuary, Ireland, following a development project of the Drogheda Port Company.	1.2891212170196102
The affected area is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. Many local and European associations have strongly criticised the project.	0.9184599010835969
Similar cases occur in other regions of the Union, where EU development funding conflicts with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measures.	1.0507435956092823
Is not the Council of the opinion that the Court of Auditors should be given more resources in order to investigate or review similar development measures where environmental conflicts arise?	1.3610685165925536
What kind of measures does the Council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the European institutions in similar cases?	1.1755605421562965
. (PT) In response to your question, Mrs McKenna, I would first of all like to highlight the fact that the role of the Court of Auditors was laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community.	1.3161096622245807
In accordance with Article 246 of the Treaty, the auditing of accounts is carried out by the Court of Auditors which, to this end, studies the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the Community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlying transactions. The Court also guarantees proper financial management.	1.3081292982335497
This is indeed also stipulated in Article 248.	0.8997074821702115
The Court of Auditors, therefore, already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role.	1.227488098635505
With regard to your suggestion for increasing the Court' s resources, the Council considers that all of the Union' s institutions have, under the Community budget, the necessary financial means for them to be able to properly carry out their respective remits.	1.4610340346496724
In some cases, it would probably be desirable for their financial resources to be increased, but there are budgetary restraints of which I am sure you are aware.	1.3695696441413454
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Budget of the European Union is approved by common agreement between the Council and this Parliament.	1.3030636126004422
The Council therefore, has no means of changing the role conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty.	1.3735447857690963
If extra resources were given to the Court of Auditors it would be money well spent, because it would ensure that EU funding was not going to something that conflicted with environmental concerns.	1.257820649322676
For years the Council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes.	1.072240126945636
I would ask you, now that you are President of the Council, will you push forward with this extremely important proposal.	1.3961228907589165
Secondly, as there is no mention of Structural Funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in?	1.6387478250448868
I would like to know what you could do about this as President-in-Office of the Council at the moment because it is the Council that has been blocking this for a long time.	1.3711965521331333
It is extremely important.	0.2902159076307632
If the Court of Auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development, it would be very important because the Court of Auditors could do an extremely good job.	1.2578004714053979
Their reports are extremely detailed and very important.	0.7688017053343558
This is the way to ensure that such conflicts are avoided in the future.	1.3901637241854372
- (PT) Mrs McKenna, a large part of the problem you have raised relates to issues which are the responsibility of the Commission.	1.3216211608157074
It is therefore the Commission that must ensure that certain development projects comply with relevant environmental provisions.	1.3019374635340155
The Commission will have to provide specific answers to these questions.	1.082110340165472
I do not think that I can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted.	1.3331381537753642
Question No 10 by (H-0053/00):	0.7768576836821205
Subject: Statute for Members of the European Parliament The Council and Parliament are going to try to reach agreement on a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament.	1.4507346145578046
One of the matters to be settled is whether Members are to receive equal pay, and where they are to pay tax.	1.4555556854541907
According to media reports the Portuguese Presidency considers that all Members should pay the same tax, to the EU. This is in conflict with the view taken by some Member States who wish to have the right to tax their Members in their home countries.	1.4091616874451682
Will the Portuguese Presidency clarify its position on this matter?	1.0639907180045702
. (PT) The Portuguese Presidency is particularly interested in this issue, as I suppose that this is the first time a presidency has made resolving the problem of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament a priority in its programme.	1.4073562433725368
The Portuguese Presidency made reaching an agreement on this statute one of its priorities, as furthermore, did the President of the European Parliament, when she stated this at the Helsinki European Council.	1.451633216594712
We are therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter.	1.178745234484356
We are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise, and we have already begun work on this matter.	1.2872759376712115
It is worth pointing out once more that this compromise will require the unanimous support of the Council, in accordance with Article 190, and the assent of this Parliament, to which it falls to approve this statute.	1.4191949652988913
The Presidency has engaged in intensive discussions with a range of Members of this Parliament and with the group to which Parliament entrusted the task of negotiating with the Council.	1.1379510575446137
I myself had an opportunity to meet this group, for the first time, in parallel with the January part-session, and I am trying to arrange to do so again soon in order to continue these discussions.	1.2950756394047338
These discussions have also recommenced more intensively in the relevant bodies of the Council, and I think that I can say, in a spirit of openness and greater flexibility, and because we all recognise the importance that this has, particularly for the general public, that drawing up this statute is a vital factor in ensuring both the dignity of the functions of Members of the European Parliament and the necessary transparency and good management of public funds.	1.4238209259362506
With regard more specifically to your question, I would like to highlight the fact that it only makes sense to have a new statute if it represents progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensures that holders of identical posts are as far as possible treated in the same way.	1.1895449708265542
This has, from the outset, been the position of the Portuguese Presidency.	1.1615761030643392
Nevertheless, our role as mediator means that we must take account of all current attitudes in the Council and I am sure you are aware, Mr Sjöstedt, that the tax issue poses problems for certain delegations.	1.6201221021236951
As this is the case, whatever solution is found, I think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all Member States, regardless of their national positions on the matter.	1.388733973640054
What I can promise with regard to this issue is that the presidency has the utmost commitment to working, for as long as it is involved with this matter, in an atmosphere of total transparency and openness towards Members of the European Parliament. We will also make the utmost effort with members of the Council, particularly with those who had most difficulty in accepting the proposal suggested last year, so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution, and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the members of this House.	1.499620819575601
Mr President, I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer. I want to ask two follow-up questions connected with the taxation of ourselves as parliamentarians.	1.3642632309770288
My basic view is that one ought to pay tax in the country in which one lives, in which one' s family lives and in which one benefits from public services.	1.3649060654727105
I intended to ask the presidency if there really is an argument for saying that we should not pay tax in our own countries just as other people do.	1.2463999711600688
Is there any argument for our being given a special privilege just because we are parliamentarians?	1.0740697695713999
That is my first question.	1.3314049870183668
My second question is about whether the Portuguese Presidency can accept a solution which involves the tax issue' s being solved in different ways for Members of different nationalities, or whether you want a solution which is identical for members of all nationalities.	1.311673115811595
- (PT) Without wishing to show any lack of respect towards this House and particularly because of the respect that your questions deserve, I would rather not answer the questions you have raised immediately.	1.348789716693611
We are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations.	0.9080438790389893
This sensitivity is reflected in the way in which the Presidency of the Council of the European Union expresses itself in a specific context in relation to particular situations.	1.1870839648703244
This has an impact of course, because it is read by other members of the Council.	1.279490552209524
At this stage in the discussion, please forgive me if I cannot give a direct answer to the specific questions that have been put to me. I would ask that we be judged on our results, when we endeavour to reach a more concrete solution in the near future.	1.2939571906136345
I will be happy to come back to Parliament to respond to and clarify the problems which may conceivably occur if a result is not reached, or to congratulate all of you if this result is achieved.	1.2729636359221748
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, after his few hours working in this Chamber with these Members of the European Parliament, whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay?	1.2813568303055554
Mr Purvis, as this discussion of salaries in the European Parliament does not relate exclusively to your country and even affects my country, I have a precise idea of what the salaries of the Members of the European Parliament are worth.	1.4725799640086168
I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem.	1.1416336104364422
Mr President, I want to thank you for your answer. I want to ask a follow-up question which bears some resemblance to the one Mr Sjöstedt asked.	1.179568686617121
We both come from Sweden. In our country, we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local.	1.2480306252358246
We have extensive services, too. We have problems stemming from the lack of confidence in politicians and, not least, in European politicians here in Parliament.	1.4397725948882314
How do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education, health care etc - but, at the same time, did not pay any tax and did not contribute?	1.1696919629545985
How do you think a system like that would affect people' s confidence in ourselves as politicians?	1.0436810209520295
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question.	0.9777530304307992
However, if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy, go ahead!	1.1257273236370078
. Mr President, I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy.	1.0831436055228663
These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society.	1.154035993461848
I do not want to enter into this type of discussion because I think that it might, to use a French expression, préjuger the Portuguese Presidency' s views in the course of the negotiations in which it is involved on the Statute for Members.	1.4273937644818724
I would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter.	0.8555633099945303
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing.	0.9425525214281578
That concludes Questions to the Council.	0.5392710792590588
(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	0.47658044788114623
Address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic	0.5118038482212212
Mr President in office, ladies and gentlemen, I have great honour in extending a warm welcome, on behalf of the House, to the President of the Czech Republic, Mr Vaclav Havel.	1.3388992163531743
I should also like to welcome Mrs Havel, who is sitting in the gallery.	1.350722746996292
You are most welcome.	0.5332254619516974
(Applause)	-0.0
This is not your first visit to our Parliament, Mr President.	1.3038657296374911
You addressed plenary in Strasbourg nearly six years ago, in March 1994, and many of us, who were already European Members of Parliament at that time, still have a vivid recollection of your speech.	1.4542956117891082
In fact, shortly after the Maastricht Treaty was ratified, you spoke in favour of strengthening European values, creating a European ethical dimension and opening the Union to the countries of central and eastern Europe.	1.1070535096099772
In other words, for many citizens, and not just in your country, you personify the European values to which we constantly voice our attachment.	1.4946496851921933
There have been extremely dynamic developments in relations between the Union and the Czech Republic following two European elections and a major new reform of the European Treaties.	1.3272240193861244
An association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the European Parliament and the Czech Parliament.	1.2801446540562826
Your country filed an official application to join the Union in 1996 and accession negotiations were finally officially opened in 1998.	1.016481573439875
The process of European integration and enlargement has speeded up impressively since the fall of the iron curtain.	0.961240606266274
The end of this artificial separation of Europe marked the start of a new era.	1.2759668627713672
We now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of Europe.	0.788765535170485
Mr President, you are a symbol of these changes.	1.4727088984394747
You founded and signed Charter 77, the human rights movement which represented and called for fundamental values during a dark period in the history of your people.	1.0319016994880175
A Communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity.	0.8500929340785499
But you never lost hope and history proved you right.	0.6867286168705224
Ten years ago, the "velvet revolution" proclaimed Havel na HRAD.	0.911785326883698
For ten years you represented democratic Czechoslovakia and, later, the Czech Republic, as its president.	1.2232201565069614
Reconciliation with your neighbours was, and still is, a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance.	1.4077702069609905
You are a first class European.	0.8866848944637772
Today, the Czech Republic is preparing to join our Union.	1.0895684876981038
I am sure that you will agree, Mr President, and experience has shown us, that the process of enlargement of the Union is not without its pitfalls for both parties and the Czech Republic will need to make a great deal of effort in order to meet the accession criteria.	1.4573583256943168
The European Union, for its part, will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement.	1.3360858551857515
It has already taken a big step forward with Agenda 2000.	1.0467420750302512
The next step, i.e. institutional reform, will be taken following the inauguration of the new Intergovernmental Conference, in which the European Parliament will be fully involved.	1.4770565405623184
Our responsibility as members of the European Parliament is to ensure that the process of enlargement takes place in an climate of optimum openness and transparency so that, when the time comes, the citizens of the European Union and the citizens of the Czech Republic will approve the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union through their elected representatives.	1.344970936543334
Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor.	1.4788008997274396
(Applause)	-0.0
Mr President, allow me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to extend our warmest thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation.	1.3927902945552904
Thank you. You are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a European identity.	1.1824403619797519
And you have used your personal experience to show us that your European identity was not decreed; it was a spontaneous and natural move.	1.1948013544605607
I have taken note of your words; this is something which we all feel very deeply.	1.1691055126294447
We find you faithful to the principles which have always guided you, which have always guided your actions; your attachment to fundamental values.	1.2017641639592977
You reminded us of your speech in 1994, which you yourself qualify as slightly provocative, but there is such a thing as creative utopia and we have been able to gauge together how far we have come.	1.272592396901993
And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need.	1.4307660629122776
To summarise, perhaps what struck me most in your speech; above all, you wished to remind us that, beyond its economic aspects, the task of constructing Europe is a spiritual one.	1.2738589821138968
We of course look forward most keenly to continuing this task with you.	0.8251332713374607
Thank you, Mr President.	0.8100041392944094
(The formal sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)	0.73863058836541
ACP-EU Joint Assembly	0.12884729365340947
The next item is the annual report (A5-0032/2000) by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the results of the activities of the ACS-EU Joint Assembly in 1999.	1.0673449142388576
, rapporteur.- Mr President, I had hoped to be rising at 9 a.m., not 9 p.m., to present this report.	1.4724887120483687
I hope the number of Members in this Chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work.	1.3662283300453755
However, it is normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is put before Members of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing that tonight.	1.4942829357905076
Once again, I can report two highly successful Assemblies having taken place, one in Strasbourg and one in Nassau.	1.3813291332550763
In many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one.	1.2972894229257526
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly is a unique organisation in world politics.	0.9096085262300274
Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern?	0.8911942840059078
The Strasbourg Assembly was the last chaired by Lord Plumb.	0.7423919759938541
In honour of the tremendous work he carried out over a difficult period the Joint Bureau in Nassau made him an honorary president, and we wish him well in his retirement.	1.3132966895638531
The two Assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the Lomé Convention and I look forward to the signature of a new Convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned.	1.0855975459692744
I remember that at the last mid-term review, when I was rapporteur, the then Commissioner Marin said that review would be the last.	1.3682245604085104
Well, he was wrong, and I pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new Convention in very difficult circumstances.	1.320089659254563
I was also delighted to hear the report this morning from Commissioner Nielson who has worked untiringly to get the right outcome to the negotiations.	1.142414870618145
I pay special tribute to him for his success.	0.8114746803865192
I also pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock and her working group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of Lomé.	1.1046685545968307
I am quite sure that Mrs Kinnock' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations.	1.341400834318234
I also thank the Working Groups on the small island states and climate change and the Follow-up Group on Fisheries for their excellent reports.	1.0265410639841985
We have had question times to the Council and the Commission and to the ACP Council, and I would like to thank those institutions for their interest in our work.	1.430247581514385
The main thrust of our work in both Assemblies was poverty eradication.	0.9424846687358455
The resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights.	1.081298502234594
It also emphasised the importance of abolishing gender inequalities and as I travel through Africa and see the work done by women I only wish there were more women in senior government positions and in presidential posts.	0.9770234028977697
We might then see an end to some of the fraud, corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some countries and that have to be stopped.	1.1614333617681318
We had, as usual, many debates on countries where there are war situations.	1.3177324303070446
I visited Ethiopia and Eritrea to gain first-hand knowledge.	0.735097189854366
The OAU is doing its best to broker a peace deal there.	0.7952146690035964
But Ethiopia is still calling for clarification on certain issues and the humanitarian situation in both countries is serious.	0.9717717237521152
We were delighted to hear in Nassau that a trade agreement was being reached with South Africa after four years of negotiations.	0.9700709494408783
This highlights the problems of coherence between the EU and the developing nations, which came to a head at the WTO talks in Seattle.	1.3059256644469845
Much work has to be done to convince the developing nations of the advantages of globalisation and world free-trade agreements.	1.1822417597013564
In Nassau, we had two interesting debates on East Timor and Cuba.	1.102892000211974
Cuba has observer status but I understand has now shown a wish to join the ACP.	1.0728194066195205
All nations from within the confines of the ACP territory who can live up to the requirements of democracy, human rights, governance and an independent judiciary are, I am sure, welcome.	1.2016774202438638
I await with interest developments in Cuba.	0.6433861963645607
When Mr Dalmau, the Cuban Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Assembly, he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known.	1.0772028759691425
On East Timor, Mr Da Costa, from the Timorese National Resistance Council, gave a very moving address indicating that East Timor would also like to join the ACP when it becomes a state with a government.	1.264507420154356
We must give them all our support to reach that goal.	1.001377371757035
Human rights is such an important issue within the ACP-EU Assembly that Joint Vice-Presidents have been appointed with special responsibilities for monitoring human rights closely and reporting to the Assembly.	1.0892336933891293
A number of cases have been highlighted, including the child soldier issue in Sudan, where many children have been abducted from neighbouring states.	1.1728743137947546
I had the honour of being elected the European Co-President at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President.	1.1234293966871103
I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly, particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May.	1.4637945263253984
We must have more equality between our ACP partners and our European members and I want to get rid of the "them and us" syndrome.	1.072087844439018
Firstly, I would like to see a Joint Parliamentary Assembly of elected members from ACP countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates.	1.1085198135393708
This I think is the new Convention.	1.2714713072712451
Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work.	1.4387810288932028
These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly.	0.8158547132401678
We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive.	1.3028105792056581
We are going to have one in Abuja in West Africa too.	0.9282938206681907
I want the Assembly to stop being just a talk-shop and become a work-shop for the betterment of all the people in developing countries.	1.1065786239515747
I want to see civil society given a louder voice.	1.146734513665769
But to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on.	1.473440150576851
We must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance.	1.0350340869067622
Equally, we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand.	1.2465105141220172
I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe.	0.9497186463053315
European taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used.	0.8049809918114706
A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to.	0.8970767653062677
The Joint Assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance, human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission.	0.9808879873221378
I believe that as equal partners the EU- and ACP-elected delegates are up to that task.	1.428646307572492
I beg to move acceptance of this report.	0.7734739444434879
Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report.	1.3145472630022823
Our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty.	1.075715353587658
But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU.	1.1048657830390758
With regard to financing, we must look to the future and provide the Joint Assembly with additional funds so that, for instance, we can send delegations to the ACP states to oversee electoral processes, at their invitation.	1.5268893406610875
In future, the EU must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and, furthermore, must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively.	1.3646615049614612
An example here could be the field of education, which will deserve and need special support in the ACP states in future.	1.3926298702956972
For instance, the very rapidly growing educational and technological potential of the Internet offers entirely new means of helping the developing countries, which at present still have modest resources, to move towards a global approach, as opposed to globalisation.	1.324401881675996
I see it as a future task of the EU to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises in the ACP states, which can promote self-help.	1.5077800806027628
An example here is the problem in Nigeria, which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers.	1.2374116216582531
One way forward to promote the setting up of SMEs could be to train the Nigerian population adequately.	0.9832997678480994
It will be easier to take account of the developing countries' very diverse problems, and EU aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if, as the report makes quite clear, we take the urgently needed step of optimising our working methods, by introducing the proposed regional assemblies.	1.3915244776559446
Thank you, Mr Zimmerling: If I am informed correctly, this is the first time you are addressing this House.	1.4508993574049984
Congratulations on your maiden speech: It went really well.	0.8613402378728559
Mr President, it cannot be repeated often enough: since 1975, the Lomé Convention has constituted an important pillar of European development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects.	1.3267913145257735
Based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality, and on parliamentary control by the Joint Assembly, it is an example to the world.	1.5350596555382388
Most appropriately, given that this year we are celebrating 25 years of cooperation under Lomé, we will shortly be signing a new and more advanced partnership agreement, which also upgrades the Joint Assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both sides.	1.2878484830758143
So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999.	1.3684497773354583
The rapporteur, Mr Corrie, has already done so most expertly.	1.2607830255220775
Much of what concerns us today is the outcome of fundamental processes of transformation in all parts of the world since the late 1980s.	1.1314288115452427
They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries.	0.6999987603208858
The after-shocks can still be felt.	0.7053576644018124
ACP cooperation is a dynamic process.	0.643342199536444
The content of the agreements has progressed steadily between Lomé I and Lomé VI.	0.9172637325212205
At the same time the number of partner states has increased considerably, now standing at 71.	1.1851526922852496
All those involved were particularly moved by the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa.	0.9325460637281385
Cuba has just knocked at the door, and, if Cuba is also accepted into the ACP-EU community, that will be a momentous step and will bring in its wake processes of change in Cuba itself.	1.3515004619695101
So ACP cooperation remains very exciting, and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new Convention.	1.5036315027343201
Fighting poverty and promoting sustained economic, cultural and social development are important objectives in the endeavour to build up democratic societies, based on respect for human rights, in the ACP states.	1.1959528249998264
That also means strengthening the democratic institutions.	0.7331614100248616
The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction.	0.9510379121821233
In the past, the representatives of the ACP countries tended to be government members, government officials or ambassadors; but today at least three quarters of the ACP delegates are elected members of parliament.	1.220207796564652
We ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100% in the near future, which is indeed what the new Convention is aiming at.	1.3705317480236667
Unfortunately there is far too little appreciation of the steady advance of processes of democratisation which, unlike the various crises that arise, largely pass unnoticed.	1.0667358469037793
One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP states is regional cooperation and integration.	1.1035688135495083
There is one wish on the European Parliament' s long wish list that will be fulfilled: as we have already heard, the Joint Assembly will soon also be able to hold regional assemblies.	1.3765812786917133
Enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic, economic, social or religious factors, i.e. have a preventive effect.	1.1554931978939447
For the same reason the European Parliament has always called for civil society to be involved in the decision-making processes and in cooperation management, and emphasised the importance of decentralised cooperation.	1.264991515515748
The enhanced contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners provided for in the new Convention are another step in the right direction.	1.1905876725795823
But I am a little sad that the European Development Fund has still not been incorporated in the Community budget.	1.4423602943011558
I hope it does not take another 25 years before we finally achieve that too.	0.9594522619973729
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Corrie on his report.	1.1701516820498605
The Lomé Convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the EU and the ACP countries for over 25 years.	1.1384721242904852
That it has continued at all in the face of overwhelming pressure against it from many quarters, including the WTO, is a triumph of sorts.	1.3391172534287785
But of course the new Convention must be measured not by the fact that it exists but by the extent to which it can contribute to the EU commitment to poverty eradication and the achievement of the international development targets.	1.4449105660595964
Measured by this yardstick there are a number of serious shortcomings in the new arrangements. For example, the agreement is particularly disappointing for those ACP countries suffering from short-term fluctuations in export earnings.	1.1269077811684078
During a marathon negotiating session in December a compromise was reached which provided that, in respect of least-developed, landlocked and island states, assistance would be provided in the event of a minimum 2% loss of export earnings rather than the level of 10% for the other ACP states.	1.2732070581823889
But at the final negotiating session the EU claimed that it had never actually agreed to the inclusion of islands and landlocked states among those which would qualify for the support on the basis of the 2% threshold.	1.1184375677743885
This change has been devastating for the Windward Islands in particular which may be the only ACP state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangements.	1.0130299167011776
This seems a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the ACP states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new Lomé arrangement.	1.2397309316592857
Meanwhile, on the trade side, pressure from the WTO to ensure that any Lomé Convention is WTO-compatible has meant that there is a huge momentum behind the idea of the so-called regional economic partnership arrangements or free-trade agreements.	1.1620753098741468
Non-least-developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements.	0.9480138806875582
Yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the chill winds of free trade without wrecking their own domestic economy.	1.0615127948144931
We therefore need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that genuine options are open to those countries which are not yet ready for free-trade arrangements.	1.2264794880099827
We need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the ACP are pursued in their own right.	1.0840436166632976
Finally, during any new trade round the EU and the ACP states should press jointly for a reform of GATT Article 24 in order to explicitly provide regional non-reciprocal trade agreements between structurally and economically dissimilar groups of countries.	1.1825049765410431
The Lomé Convention is a unique partnership; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of Lomé and involve a participation of the WTO and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora.	1.3102702190811966
Mr President, what I want to do in this debate is condemn the fate reserved for the poor countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.	1.4471857709011966
People have the gall to say they benefit from the Lomé Convention, but even looking at trading relations alone, the Lomé Convention has done nothing to protect those countries; their already feeble share in trade with Europe has been halved.	1.1878276506578793
That reflects the growth of inequality between EU and ACP countries.	0.6576084535782145
The Lomé Convention essentially benefits a few large industrial or financial conglomerates, which continue to pillage those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence, notably on the former colonial powers.	1.1157389980384032
When it comes to so-called development aid, given that underdevelopment in the majority of these countries is getting worse rather than better, development is clearly not what the aid is for, even when it is not just a disguised export subsidy for European manufacturers.	1.4314706063986167
The aid is primarily a windfall for incumbent regimes, and the poor majority does not benefit at all.	1.2554785905678651
Even if it were properly redirected this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care, education or drinking water supply.	1.2762566059276133
For some years now the great powers have been reducing the amount of this already derisory aid, and it is the height of cynicism when this is done on the pretext of human rights violations or corruption.	1.2379706260560912
After all, who protects these deeply corrupt regimes, if not the governments of the rich countries?	1.3678199407518346
They turn a blind eye to the masters of corruption, the big groups controlling oil, water supply, or public works. They could clamp down on them since their head offices are here in Europe.	1.2562891880917153
The debate about either extending the Lomé Convention with its quotas and protectionism, or, instead, gradually winding down the special relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries in the name of free trade, is a warped debate between two ways of perpetuating the pillage and impoverishment of those countries.	1.2711999512517993
I protest against an ignoble and inhuman organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a wretched death to enrich a minority.	0.823715550513739
A mere fraction of the fantastic wealth accumulated by the big groups could lift these poor countries out of extreme poverty, but, until we have the courage to take on those big capitalist groups, we are just covering up the real problems.	1.2472094933609539
Mr President, I want to thank the Co-President of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly, Mr Corrie. It was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the ACP-EU Assembly.	1.49792128787945
In this speech, I will confine myself to addressing certain points I consider fundamental.	1.0783996609241335
I believe the European Parliament should call for the Assembly to become truly parliamentary, urging all ACP countries to send members of their national parliaments as their representatives, so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric.	1.286270862779397
My next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the WTO, which is seen by the ACP countries as an enormous danger to their development.	1.491884733008307
I do believe the ACP countries need a transition period, but they also need support in the context of the new logic of regionalisation of aid, not only in agriculture and fisheries, but also in the exploitation of mineral and underground resources, some of which are being exploited, with slim economic returns to the ACP countries themselves.	1.404341386928415
Thirdly, the European Parliament - through a joint working group within the Joint Assembly - must make a major effort to achieve stability in ACP countries' budgets through the selection of budgetary items to permit economic and, above all, social development, and by monitoring income and fiscal policies in force in the ACP countries.	1.3918911553527944
We must put the people of the ACP countries first in our relationship with their rulers, who need to be fully aware that development aid from the European Union is intended for the people and not for the oligarchies that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries.	1.4162805479281166
Fourthly, and finally, the prevention of inter-ethnic conflicts between States must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals I have set out.	1.2649994843360581
Mr President, I agree with the positive evaluation Mrs Junker has just made and I want to add that Mr Corrie has started his term as Co-President of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly with effective and impartial work deserving of our full appreciation.	1.13508735127823
I shall restrict my speech to one particular act which took place a few days ago, partly as a consequence of events alluded to in the report we are debating here.	1.2128963078822215
I refer to Cuba' s expression of intent, of 2 February, to become a full member of the ACP group of countries.	1.4549600334579043
A Cuban delegation attended the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, and Vice-Chancellor Dalmau spoke in the plenary session, engaging in a lively debate, and afterwards held conversations with many of us.	1.164526493263823
Following Nassau, a delegation from Parliament led by Mr Corrie and the Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Joaquín Miranda, visited Havana and a series of very illuminating exchanges of opinion took place.	1.0091417314656213
It is my impression that this mission from the European Parliament was the final push which convinced our Cuban friends that the time had come to move forward on mechanisms of cooperation with the European Union.	1.259783316576972
We are witnessing events of great political significance and I hope that we in the European Parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union, so that Cuba' s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible.	1.3013577944214243
That is important, for at least three reasons.	1.1972461408648285
First, it is important for Cuba, to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the United States blockade, which has been repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations.	1.4596744343675037
Secondly, we must bear in mind that Cuba' s application has the support of all the ACP countries.	1.3154716115539242
If the European Union responds positively to the recommendation of our associates, we will be proving our respect and consideration for those associates and this will have positive effects on the whole framework of our cooperation with them.	1.2847018574228017
Nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter.	1.1803877296740382
By accepting Cuba into the ACP community we will be demonstrating that our Europe is not involved in the shameful process of 'playing but not paying' , and that, when we get indignant about absurdities like the Helms-Burton Act, we are not being hypocritical but are ready to act and take all the consequences.	1.2671118636192935
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly meets again in a few weeks time and I am sure this subject will be dealt with there.	1.299542567409743
Ideally the European Parliament' s representatives should be able to support Cuba' s intent at those proceedings, as our parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries will no doubt be doing.	1.2561566975119143
Of course, Cuba must meet all the standard conditions, just like any other member.	1.2873852919907545
The Cubans know that and I am sure they accept it.	1.2143734220369269
It must also be made clear that Cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners.	1.1884463662116906
Cuba' s wish to join is welcome and Cuba will be welcome in our circle.	1.0175712928255467
I say that wholeheartedly, but also with the deep conviction that, just as the blockade has produced nothing but poverty and, as a consequence of that, extreme tension and a hardening of the Cuban position, the integration we are supporting here, and the prosperity it will produce, will translate into the détente and openness we all seek and from which all of us, especially the Cuban people, will benefit.	1.4576189729445843
Mr President, I also want to begin by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Corrie, for an excellent report which I think very well describes and summarises the work which has been done in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in the course of 1999.	1.3854698626636361
I do not have very long in which to speak, and I really only want to take up two questions.	1.5885634396415522
The first is about the fight against poverty, which I think is becoming an embarrassment both for the EU and the Member States.	1.522370309768746
In spite of the fact that, both in the Treaty and at the UN' s meetings in Rio and Copenhagen, there was an undertaking to work to eradicate poverty in the world, the budget for development aid is, in actual fact, being cut back, when the express desire was that exactly the opposite should happen.	1.4806081542348664
We must put a stop to this trend.	0.9646709129606426
We must begin by writing off debts. We must follow up words with action.	1.0873724259700743
I should like us to take a leading role in this work.	1.1970413568543894
My second question concerns the fact that, in many contexts, we talk about the ACP countries having to learn the principles of democracy.	1.4289878152239628
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution demand, within the context of the new agreement, that working methods should be developed and optimised.	1.4843491126998387
The ACP countries are to be urged to allow a whole range of political opinions to come up for discussion.	1.13404592624312
I think that is a very good idea indeed, and I fully subscribe to it.	1.8503257817031569
However, we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements.	1.3595119046518749
How do these operate within the European Parliament' s delegation to the ACP-EU' s Joint Assembly?	1.3522513700936765
In contrast to how things are done here in the European Parliament and in Parliament' s committees, where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports, there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the Joint Assembly. The two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves.	1.3246275075927607
In order to change this undemocratic arrangement, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have tabled Amendment No 6 in which we request that the rapporteurs appointed to produce reports and consultative documents, together with the members of working parties, should be appointed in accordance with clear, democratic rules.	1.2566639440603058
In this context, account ought to be taken of the smaller groups, and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements.	1.1660125324935005
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the quality of his report, which appropriately reflects the tenor of the debates in the Joint Assembly he so effectively co-chaired.	1.1374431199185742
The eradication of poverty was central to our work and many speakers highlighted the need to preserve an essential tool for achieving that ambitious aim, to whit, preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries within the framework of the Lomé Conventions.	1.2054825825977118
The challenge was immense.	0.4415088619441869
Globalisation, free trade, and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy, were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue.	1.2623514533369136
So we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development, and personally I am convinced that the work of the last Joint Assembly did have a decisive influence on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations, as did the new climate created by the events at Seattle.	1.3648821310498884
However, while I welcome the renewal of the agreements, what I find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close.	1.3620755699942229
The European Union seems to me to have finally emerged from the old paternalist, or frankly neo-colonialist, logic where those giving aid are all too eager to start giving lessons, following a formula our friend Michel Rocard is so keen on.	1.1696029865652298
The Union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners.	1.2006552164588966
By refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool, in the hands of technocrats, for imposing new sets of conditions, the European Union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty.	1.4667421334854909
We have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events.	0.9825243424583685
What right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history, values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own?	0.9310806978953379
Personally, I prefer the willingness that is clearly flagged up in these agreements to extend the partnership to new agents - local authorities, non-governmental organisations - which seems to me to represent the only possible way the people of these countries can progressively achieve ownership cooperation.	1.3863025334554306
In short, this is the only way they can emerge from humiliating and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves, the proof of success.	1.2233912141833074
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the accuracy and rigour of the summary in his report.	1.0873848131955197
The European Parliament' s opinion on the activities of the ACP-European Union Joint Assembly has always had a major impact, undeniably contributing to a consistent policy and role for the European Union in development and cooperation.	1.3302517279198813
The important role of the increasingly parliamentary Joint Assembly in strengthening relations between the European Union and the ACP countries needs to be stressed.	1.199260982173729
In view of this positive action, there is every advantage to be gained from according the Joint Assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work.	1.222269195805221
We back the rapporteur' s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies, under the aegis of the Joint Assembly, in the six regions of the Convention: the Caribbean, the Pacific and four African regions.	1.3865536262520561
These regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas.	0.9378003030292764
Poverty has been the common denominator of all the debates in the Joint Assembly and its eradication is the priority for the European Union' s development policy.	1.1365808263638923
In line with the resolution at the Nassau meeting, we must concentrate on meeting the poverty reduction targets agreed by the international community.	1.142534707927259
Consistency and action are needed.	0.550028778177207
The next Lomé Convention must specify the investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and the participation of local bodies.	1.0115825597350458
The participation of local bodies is absolutely essential.	0.7361489456553846
In a wider context, the priorities, as I see it, are to convert poor countries' debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development, as well as control of fraud and corruption.	1.194448547741784
We need to make progress with concrete and consistent action.	1.2766208214563424
People in the poor countries are beginning to despair.	0.9372343188307332
I call on the Commission to act on the rapid accession of East Timor to the Lomé Convention as one means, amongst others, of promoting the eradication of poverty and accelerating its economic, cultural and social development, in order to strengthen its internal democratisation.	1.20100531452985
Finally, I must congratulate the Council Presidency on the coming Europe-Africa Summit and call on all the participants to contribute to solid practical action to promote the development of peace, democracy and the eradication of poverty in the underdeveloped countries of Africa.	1.29341407863813
. (DA) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the Joint Assembly for its work in 1999.	1.201814366620385
I am also delighted to be able to confirm that I shall be participating in the Joint Assembly' s next meeting, which takes place in March in Nigeria.	1.2968373920364904
The Commission is pleased to see the Joint Assembly playing a larger role, especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development.	1.2530048437904773
The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty continues to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role.	1.1430427601868345
In order to be able to develop, the countries concerned must, however, become actively involved in the global economic system.	1.3714284573955349
With regard to trade with our partners in development, the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries' special economic and social limitations.	1.2972727597639897
Mrs Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continued with.	0.7515838334108157
I do not agree.	1.266309860256299
That system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is, in actual fact, of use only to relatively few of the 71 countries concerned.	1.3103581610547286
It operates too slowly, and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future, because this will operate more flexibly.	1.5481487666027316
Regarding the future accession of countries such as East Timor to the Lomé Convention, I can only repeat what I recently said to the European Parliament' s Committee on Development and Cooperation, namely, that the door is open.	1.1745467556727534
It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door.	1.1693181716993162
Once they have done so, we shall adopt a position on the matter.	1.2680430327403382
With regard to Cuba' s application for accession to the Lomé Convention, the Commission notes that, according to their recent declaration, the ACP States support Cuba' s application.	1.364729126540401
The EU has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards Cuba, as outlined in the EU' s common position, but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex.	1.3464453642979537
With regard to the Côte d' Ivoire, I can inform you that the whole of the EUR 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities.	1.5328538461836199
With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget, I can say that this is being considered.	1.4467138628495977
For its part, the Commission supports this, but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the whys and wherefores.	1.4378922112579562
Concerning Article 366A, I can say that, during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement, a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed.	1.3204602932699137
It is now the case, following adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty, that Parliament wishes, on the basis of Article 300, to be kept fully informed of all decisions, and the Commission will continue to take account of Parliament' s decisions on this subject.	1.597946653107704
There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions.	1.093719876910867
This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty.	0.8296091881962248
Finally, I would refer to the South Africa agreement, which the rapporteur also touched upon.	1.5342829291801134
In this regard, I am simply pleased - delighted, in fact - here this evening, as a conclusion to this debate, to be able, very appropriately, to inform you that South Africa' s President has today said yes to the solution which the EU' s Council of Foreign Ministers last Monday agreed unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problems regarding South Africa.	1.499208397685335
So the "Grappa War" is over.	0.8893554290299067
Peace has broken out, and we can now look forward to cooperation with South Africa in accordance with the common dreams and values which ought to have underpinned the whole business from the start.	1.3574435128582427
I think this rather nicely puts the finishing touches to a debate which has, on the whole, been quite positive, and I would repeat my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the cooperation which has gone into our relations with the Third World on precisely the work in question.	1.4323220808530321
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.1800861409464389
Stabilisation and association agreement with FYROM	0.48465110390120497
The next item is the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with FYROM (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121(COS)).	0.9027141154053979
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, today we are discussing a country that really has suffered hard times, a country that is, however, moving in a very promising direction, thanks to its own efforts and resolve and certainly also thanks to the support of the international community.	1.3761628093675253
So if the European Union, the Council and the Commission are proposing - and I assume that Parliament will support that proposal tomorrow - the first stabilisation and association agreement in south-eastern Europe, in the Balkan region - I am quite happy to use that term - it is primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that FYROM itself has worked its way into a good position, in economic and, of course, mainly in political terms, in face of the war in the neighbouring region and also in relation to its own minority.	1.5915976815838144
For it is no small thing to have a minority of 33% or even 35% in one' s own country.	1.545438367322562
That country and its politicians - no doubt with some differences here and there - have always done very good work, and we should recognise that.	1.3485920770133484
The Commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the Council.	1.2719685224068222
Let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat, although, even in this regard, I want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge Commissioner Patten' s activities and interest in relation to FYROM and the region as a whole.	1.2393490378386702
Firstly, there is the regional approach.	1.4245643527275393
I believe that if it is understood properly, the regional approach is both important and necessary.	1.4498384786370637
There has to be a willingness to cooperate.	1.0180444758008105
Provided it is not seen as some kind of constraint but as a willingness to cooperate, as an opportunity that each country should grasp, then this is the right approach.	1.5420422566266694
The problem is that, when we look at FYROM, we can see how very difficult it is to cooperate economically with some neighbouring countries, such as Kosovo and Albania, or to cooperate politically with, for instance, Yugoslavia.	1.443901260586895
On the other hand, cooperation with Bulgaria, and in particular with Greece, has made good progress and I think we should acknowledge that too.	1.4081178533171663
In this context, the European Union must consider, as it began to do early this week, how to include the neighbouring Yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything, i.e. without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime.	1.3987846476806116
Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation.	1.107351245699072
In that regard allow me to say, since I come from a country through which the Danube flows, that I am grateful that the Commission, i.e. Commissioner Patten and also Vice-President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, is considering opening the Danube to shipping again. That would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too, which, of course, would be of particular importance to Romania.	1.5359848863418792
In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt.	1.5205977840841196
As I said, it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition.	1.102961641609129
Secondly, let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union.	1.2779096733139863
In our view, it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now, but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date.	1.2064050465064469
FYROM wants to be told here and now that, in principle, accession will be possible when the time is right.	1.2879351763657931
This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined.	1.4176511801331586
It sees, in the whole readjustment of aid instruments, a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards Europe but that this train will continue through Europe while leaving FYROM on a siding.	1.3044484664857638
I think Commissioner Patten understands that too.	0.6417771502723293
So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks.	1.2112589172869268
Thirdly, I believe that, so far at least, FYROM has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly.	1.3706223222058187
Even though there will of course be readjustments here, FYROM will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being dealt with in Brussels today can in future be handled in Skopje, in the country itself.	1.321757694739103
I hope that the honourable Members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM.	1.26765096443116
Mr President, since the start of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this abbreviation - has behaved as a constructive peace-keeper.	1.6044983366934833
We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view.	1.2506892700605985
As you can see, our Macedonian friends have always played a very positive role and it is for this reason that it should be pointed out at this stage that Macedonia is not just a pawn in our so-called strive towards stability, but actually took the initiative.	1.3075926172257935
The former President, Mr Gligorov, can take special credit for this, and the current President too has already adopted the profile of President of all Macedonian citizens, so much so that the European Union should only be grateful to have him as interlocutor in the Balkans.	1.3776287276750085
Despite the obvious reasons for any internal tension, both population groups have struck a reasonable modus vivendi and the outlook for reaching a sound solution to the remaining problems is good.	1.0782503665189032
It was, in fact, in Macedonia that I heard at the time about the Roma population actually not having too bad a time there.	1.2395993050911256
I was unaccustomed to hearing this type of comment about the Roma in Europe.	0.808274634182995
With regard to the problems afflicting Macedonia, higher education for the Albanian-speaking citizens deserves our special attention.	1.1399272280231445
Accessible higher education, with which you have a certain affinity, is an important instrument in the emancipation of population groups. I am speaking from personal experience as someone who attended the Protestant university in Amsterdam.	1.4155566097728087
I might never have studied otherwise.	0.6108243958524938
Such an affinity and this type of higher education is also important in the development of the constitutional state and for the aptly termed mainstream society which needs to be strengthened in countries like this.	1.1365113062466945
The agreement with Macedonia should partly compensate for the damage which this country incurred following the boycott we instituted against Serbia, which is at no cost to us but costs Serbia' s neighbouring states all the more.	1.205585874883265
It would be beneficial if we could reorganise this, especially vis-à-vis the neighbouring states.	1.21715062374662
It is only fair that we should regulate aid to Macedonia properly now.	1.173886127391567
We are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals' amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states' interests, for we need to give industry in Macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction.	1.3348810527271815
I am more than happy to include Bulgaria and Romania in this, as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former Yugoslavia, plus Albania.	1.1668024575321065
It is important to us that the economies in the region can stand on their own two feet again, which can quite easily be done with the aid money.	1.4514454903918945
The agreement with Macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the European Union, allowing this country to join, even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future.	1.2973278891666602
In the meantime, we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for Macedonian legislation to resemble that of the Member States, and our policy should reflect this, even in the naming of aid programmes for Macedonia.	1.350549483360435
I would quote the PHARE programme as an example.	0.8876238205636247
Mr President, the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivities surrounding it.	1.4230840195537209
I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic.	1.1552112139940756
If certain countries wish to use the words "former Yugoslavia" , then that is their business; others need not feel obliged to copy them.	1.155054914331507
It will not do to keep us under constant pressure.	1.0243612255773715
Hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda; we have come to expect nothing less of him, and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia.	1.4062462658298112
Mr President, let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda' s work as rapporteur.	1.1951908871019652
Today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia.	1.1226973671940559
We do so in the awareness that this decision, the very first relating to that area, is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the Balkans.	1.3869920287338509
This new phase, or rather policy, identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully.	1.0865123247109802
Our agreement to the negotiations, as set out in the rapporteur' s explanatory statement, is born of the conviction that it is right for Union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the acquis communautaire.	1.225561794831623
This is the dual objective which I believe should be pursued. On the one hand, we must maintain programmes on, for example, infrastructure, preparations - still premature - for free trade, and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area, and on the other, it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an example of the policy.	1.4246107624902047
And there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive.	1.056871933487409
As we were able to ascertain during our missions to Skopje, there has been considerable progress in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as regards the economy, movement towards democracy and - an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the Balkans - multi-ethnic coexistence.	1.1882678497015353
On the other hand, the price Macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring Kosovo is very high, both in terms of logistic availability of NATO forces and in terms of reduced exports to Northern Europe.	1.0710332032076797
I conclude, Mr President, by affirming that this progress is indeed difficult, fragile, and uncertain and it calls for constant vigilance on our part during the various stages of close and precise inspection that have long been advocated.	1.1611818923119792
Mr President, Commissioner, I rise to express the warmth and optimism with which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the start of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	0.9938237890104579
We are extremely hopeful that, along the lines set out by the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries, especially Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosovo and, as soon as possible, Serbia.	1.2674973170151382
We are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the Kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence, with all the consequences of that in terms of continental, if not world, instability.	1.3423765042584375
If the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia. And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent.	1.3974317927040312
It is in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement.	1.2536837363838134
Very rapid and direct involvement of south-east Europe in the life of the European institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the European Parliament, and that staff from those countries could work in the Court of Justice and the Commission.	1.4497587444494398
But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development.	1.333338202875928
With this in mind, we have presented some amendments which I hope Parliament will accept.	1.403303425285654
First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted.	1.153097213786214
Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system.	1.3166994797854972
Thirdly, world aid and assistance coming into the region, and hence into Macedonia as well, should be clearly multilateral, and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country.	1.3472745741545864
Mr President, Commissioner, we hope the agreement can achieve all its objectives but we cannot delude ourselves that peace, stability and prosperity in south-east Europe can be achieved without dealing with the very wide-ranging problems we are trying to eliminate.	1.2532661383071744
I am referring to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, the need to involve Serbia in the region' s reconciliation process and - why not? - new discussions on relations between the European Union, NATO and the UN, in the light of the new balance that needs to be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty, which I think calls for a change in the existing UN Charter.	1.3357838489848592
Mr President, Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has knocked everything off balance.	1.089549866646479
This is certainly true for the relations between the European Union and the western Balkans.	1.131572383338031
Since then, expectations have been high.	0.8499163191854804
This applies to them and us.	1.1725463013979582
This is true on their part because - whether we like it or not - they are asking us for direct aid and they are wondering what Europe wants from them at the end of the day?	1.207987699824734
Is there any prospect of membership?	0.7553078405262826
This is very much on their minds.	1.0133466229305161
But here too, within the European Union, expectations are high.	1.1934176038293853
If we do things properly, this may well be a first taster of a genuine common foreign and security policy.	1.2247867994685506
Will the Union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy, for the first time, concerning such a difficult regulation?	1.2242800290477958
It also remains to be seen whether the European Union has learnt any lessons from the bad experiences in Bosnia when it comes to providing aid and the slightly better experiences in Kosovo.	1.2024183610812944
Can we, based on the experiences in Macedonia and in four other countries, improve on this?	0.9969767743997348
Against this background of extremely high expectations, I do not think that I am exaggerating if I say that this first step, namely the stability and association agreement with Macedonia, is vitally important.	1.3927356756940517
This is not the Union' s only contribution.	1.4710905418426465
The debate on the Stability Pact, the debate on the CARA programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending.	1.1756989282880799
We are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements, that is to say a medium-term issue.	1.317822480328893
This is why I think that this first agreement with Macedonia is so crucial, because it serves as a model.	1.408045635569536
I am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen.	0.9598509646645375
What does the European Union intend to do with Macedonia?	1.486325328794411
Will it do the same to us?	0.7653836135741826
This first step is so important because of this model function.	1.1563269333733992
Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason.	0.7437262615648923
The rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms, namely, the issue of interethnic relations.	1.098570707526626
There is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture.	1.1320165052382438
During the presidential elections, it appeared that things were not running too smoothly, but compared to the rest of the region, Macedonia could serve as a model.	1.192294648191594
We would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonians.	1.0581976130799249
This model function also applies to regional cooperation.	0.8948424525022022
I could not agree more with the rapporteur: a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece, and not cutting them off on the other.	1.3018573730821434
Mr President, Commissioner, if we manage this first step successfully, we will have gained a great deal.	1.434634742607038
If we mess it up, then we will have lost a great deal more.	1.1475102934250276
Mr President, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle.	1.351564122192353
I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support.	1.4052176610092886
I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia.	0.6854819524940113
Do not misunderstand me: I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime.	1.1597392005724676
But firstly, these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too, including Macedonia, which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is.	1.4302209760648865
Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive.	1.4356619597385267
So I believe that we should take today' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10.	1.3596381229355192
Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe.	1.3482704336805118
This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region.	1.2964038886391418
The European Union' s contribution under the Stability Pact, now converted into what is called the "stabilisation and association process" , represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, and it should therefore contribute to regional stability.	1.3152560547369008
So establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis, and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process, constitutes an important contribution to stability in the Balkans.	1.1569107313826694
The assumption is that the countries are prepared to accept a certain set of conditions.	1.1365867515522081
The expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day, maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course.	1.3169099262654114
We are not deluding ourselves by believing that, once agreement is obtained, the mandate we are giving the Commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long-suffering region, where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development.	1.442819049120247
They have suffered enough, first under the Soviet yoke and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc.	1.0794604956718195
The evidence is that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is politically and economically capable of establishing new contractual relations with the European Union, going beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 June 1998, which in practice targets respect for the acquis communautaire, especially in key areas of the internal market.	1.2096129106047755
It is true that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia still has a long way to go, but, given the political and economic reforms already made in the context of the cooperation agreement, and with transitional periods accepted for certain domains, the country will be able to fulfil the conditions for a stabilisation and association agreement.	1.3475922488411052
We share the view that its development is a factor for stability in the region, we approve the terms of the negotiating mandate as proposed, emphasising that what is involved is a bilateral agreement with the European Union, and we agree with the rapporteur when he stresses that this is the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south-east Europe, and that the issue is how the Balkans can be structured in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability.	1.440326291172856
The various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context.	1.0133045254548567
This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region.	1.0977209129759893
That is why it is so important.	0.9094941530326349
The point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the European Union to draw closer to these countries.	1.2571329544746508
We are aware that some of them are already undergoing processes of democratic stabilisation, that others still need to affirm the democratic authority of their governments, and that equilibrium in others depends on the military presence in the zone, but they are all countries which now know that, once they have overcome their difficulties, a bridge is available to provide an effective link with the European Union.	1.3716930376668857
Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow Members.	1.0638770382179634
I think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy.	1.3361739960895433
Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example.	0.8674607496274728
We know there are 13 applicant countries, from Lithuania to Turkey, and just one black hole in Europe, the Balkans, but because these countries are denied the opportunity to become applicants, we want to make them believe that this agreement is a miracle.	1.5956584322471121
Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status.	0.752791613181729
But this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, if negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years.	1.544175242649989
And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia, amongst the Balkan countries, three years hence.	1.0815959857026511
A few days ago Mr Racan announced that Croatia' s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000.	0.9459515618045262
There are bound to be other applications and this great work, this fine intellectual architecture, will crumble, left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former Yugoslavia for the past 20 years.	1.291442632386543
This would not be so serious if this region of Europe were not so beset by the problems we are all aware of, problems which are being addressed, but which have not yet been resolved, by the new government of Macedonia. There are the problems of coexistence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, the connected problems of Kosovo, the notorious economic problems, the problems of being neighbour to a particularly developed mafia in Serbia, and then there is the problem of the Greek veto which must be condemned for what it is.	1.4932158931186332
After nearly 10 years, Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name, and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia.	1.3619201308798632
It is absolutely absurd. Apart from anything else it is offensive, in my opinion, to the Greek MEPs and the citizens of Greece.	1.4335269768472516
This question needs to be resolved urgently.	1.0360230480272938
Finally, by happy chance, a letter from Mr Georgievski, President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler, dated 8 March, has come into my hands. In it, referring to Article O, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union.	1.4096484335583548
Why has the Council not informed us of this?	0.97091252667974
Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia?	1.053337322317545
Mr President, Commissioner, the Balkans are not purely a dark cave, politically speaking.	1.1895613027387086
The decidedly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves.	1.0014644848101122
The gruesome escalation of ethnic violence in neighbouring Kosovo did not reach its territory.	0.785721892634512
Paradoxically, but truly, the war in Kosovo Polje generated exactly the opposite effect: the perilous gap of confidence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority became decidedly smaller.	1.105962960125237
From the point of view of the Macedonian majority, the Albanian minority behaved loyally towards the common state during the international explosion of the Kosovo conflict.	1.0385682684365594
In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo' s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme.	1.0274092362787457
This remarkable upshot of the Kosovar war negotiations can therefore justifiably be seen as the internal, political establishment of the Republic of Macedonia the second time round.	1.2321279762234996
Mr Swoboda' s well-balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level.	0.952029851211297
In brief, the European Union knows what to do in Macedonia: to help this local port of refuge - recently used by scores of war refugees - to fulfil its role properly as a catalyst for the planned Stability Pact in the Balkans.	1.324385844695693
Mr President, as one who has been concerned with Macedonia for eight years, I have to contradict Mr Dupuis.	1.4606962945514992
What we are doing here is not hypocritical.	0.9637610956182024
We have reached a propitious moment and I think the Macedonians are glad about it.	1.1575726923918963
Please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything.	0.6837796287232699
I think we should take a more positive approach here.	1.1823985358492068
Macedonia did not go through a war.	0.8446720029624835
But it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions, as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries.	1.2054050618562893
It suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war.	0.7143867101164247
So we must admit that developments in Macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines.	0.8355517514331139
This is a country that has difficult inter-ethnic problems to deal with at home, and is resolving them with increasing success.	1.38331974586064
Let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30% of ethnic Albanians in government activity, in government policy and in society, is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia.	1.369129080722215
I am glad to see that the hope Mr Swoboda expressed in his report will be fulfilled early in March, i.e. that we will finally have an EU delegation there and that we, as the European Union, will finally have a greater role to play there.	1.3942964634403634
I believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country.	1.3402566563464693
As a sign of our political commitment, we must finally show Macedonia in practice that we are indeed rewarding its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embarking on regional projects.	1.182772137527334
Let me name just two small ones: the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier crossing with Kosovo in Blace and the creation of Corridor 8, from Albania via Macedonia to Bulgaria.	1.1185273885892983
I think Mr Swoboda has drafted an excellent report, and it has my wholehearted support.	1.2474977767049933
Mr President, I too would like to compliment Mr Swoboda on his report.	1.1284463036837942
I think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it.	1.3120035148270575
The report tackles stability in the region in a structural manner. This is also the purpose of the pending agreement with the Republic of Macedonia which we are debating today.	1.4221859188936459
Although the actual implementation of the Stability Pact has not yet started, the Commission has already developed the new instrument, entitled the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.	1.2580544588011084
This marks the beginning of the treaty-based stabilising process for the countries of the former Yugoslavia.	1.3274265383178925
These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement.	0.9279315890898777
The present agreement is a kind of pre-pre-agreement, but with a view to joining in future.	1.2680944441011925
The instrument of joining countries together by means of active treaties is excellent, provided that the agreements stipulated in them are implemented dynamically, so that the required stabilisation can actually be attained.	1.051894569879287
Macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match.	0.8826597450849225
It does, however, have the ambition to break free from this image.	1.1468579679161655
This requires internal stability.	0.4409590843366402
The new government would like to tackle this matter and the agreement could be an agenda for reforms, including a direct role and equality for the Albanian minority.	1.4387052776200815
More than anything, the country needs peace and quiet now, in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to greater prosperity.	1.393361851650258
We, the social democrats, would urge the opposition to back these ideas.	1.3668109118783485
They need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model.	0.8421822839241639
But the country also - and especially - needs external stability.	1.4274067559738692
What is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable?	1.0803413094546412
This stability is required in the relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria.	1.162370720007252
The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist.	1.081765310352908
External stability also means open borders and regional cooperation.	0.8265278386516354
Minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange.	1.1015734957991288
Macedonia' s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries.	0.9606385945416663
The Kosovo problem is well-known and the international community is present there on a massive scale.	1.1478725583326324
It seems that the Albania factor is being underestimated.	0.8838254891413856
The Union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country.	1.046806085254647
But what then instead?	0.44243957143623813
It is the very argument to conclude an agreement with Macedonia and not yet with Albania that cause us so much concern, so much so that a passive stance from the Union vis-à-vis Albania is really not acceptable.	1.2286417335443949
What does the Commission intend to do regarding this issue?	0.6665558416828723
Yugoslavia is just as much a weak link in the stability process and, as such, a threat to Macedonia' s stability.	1.322552782398678
We need to wait and see what happens there.	1.1379547031463264
The mood in Belgrade is becoming less predictable by the day.	0.7895884388142306
We, however, second the Council' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus.	1.3902659064619254
In this way, at least a serious attempt is being made to give the opposition, which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations, a shot in the arm.	1.4026889300340768
What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met?	1.345571729243547
What else can we do to support this opposition?	1.0295388676644064
Mr President, Commissioner, Kosovo was hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpreted as saying that dictators could persecute minorities in the most repellent way on the grounds that "it is happening within their own nation" .	1.1234195220751197
When the USA and NATO and, finally, also the EU, reacted, it was already late, in fact very late.	1.6495346697997424
A great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the EU, among others, has acted earlier and more decisively.	1.26181811555471
We, the European Union, therefore have a special responsibility to help, support and rebuild the Balkans now.	1.4691134633534773
Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU - economically, politically and in terms of trade.	1.2841291168077593
Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration.	1.0842551596029628
We Liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly, just as Paolo Costa reported.	1.2179856915003333
It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report.	1.530827431988069
Macedonia deserves our support, especially in view of the self-sacrificial, disinterested work which the people and leaders of Macedonia undertook during the Kosovo war.	1.0451655250923562
Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms.	1.014805487355828
We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans.	1.1689831805982471
This is an urgent duty for the EU.	1.2664134990817755
Mr President, allow me in this context to remind MEPs - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war, human degradation, murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia.	1.394176389991295
The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free.	0.8142301304148282
I am talking about Milosevic.	0.6984800201000332
As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path, Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans, including in Macedonia.	1.1862006419881268
Mr President, the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe,	1.345265514866489
Its terms, which the Swoboda report accepts, are certainly not directed towards peace, but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country, and towards controlling its natural wealth, overexploiting its workforce and continuing to use that country as a springboard against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order.	1.354038481837538
All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union.	1.061339343031635
The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe.	1.2370415252342815
It is characteristic that the report congratulates FYROM on the constructive stance it maintained during the NATO attack, eulogises its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for NATO forces, but, of course, remains silent about the indignation of its people, which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the NATO bombardments.	1.1878312161001345
Finally, because we consider that both the stability pact and the stabilisation and association process the European Union is implementing in countries in that area, will create new problems there, new tribulations for their peoples, and will reinforce the dominant role of the American and European imperialists, we will be voting against the report in an expression of our solidarity with the people of FYROM.	1.5711939564314197
Mr President, Commissioner, one of the most basic aims of the European Union' s stability and association agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area, and this, of course, presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved.	1.4017285846468466
I shall not bother you with details of the problem concerning the name FYROM, which as you must know, is the subject of a difference of opinion with Greece and of negotiations between the two countries lasting over four years, under the aegis of the Secretary General of the UN in the context of related Security Council resolutions, but also the conventional obligation of the respective parties pursuant to Article 5 of the so-termed Intermediate Agreement of 1995.	1.423313083415076
I do, however, think it appropriate to say that, at the forthcoming negotiations and with the conclusion of the association agreement, the European side must point out to the Skopje government the need for it to show appropriate constructive political will, so that it may contribute positively to a successful outcome of the talks in New York.	1.3878976405209682
I should like to hope that such an appeal from Europe, with parallel emphasis on the difficulties that any further indecision would create for completing and implementing the association agreement, would be duly heeded and appraised accordingly by the Skopje government, so that it can respond appropriately, on the one hand, to Greece' s demonstrably conciliatory attitude concerning the specific issue, and, on the other hand, to the more general practical, declared intention and disposition of all the partners in the European Union, including Greece, to facilitate and support FYROM' s progress towards a United Europe.	1.3255604743434997
Mr President, this is because I do not think that the harmonious day to day relations, contacts and communication between FYROM and Greece that have actually been achieved at both bipartite and multipartite level, and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement, I repeat, I do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good neighbourliness necessary, inter alia, for negotiating and concluding an association agreement.	1.3095633044563155
On the contrary, I think that this demand can only be considered satisfied by a de jure full normalisation of FYROM' s relations with all its neighbours.	1.1294980606715737
That, combined with the essential improvement of certain aspects of the internal situation in that country, in the area of minorities and democratic institutions, would round off the image of political maturity which FYROM has, in fact, presented in other respects and which has made our European family welcome closer relations with it.	1.3893440199688192
Mr President, the agreement we are debating today, as analysed by Mr Swoboda, which I hope we will adopt tomorrow, constitutes the second politically positive step, after the stability pact for the area.	1.5904078029521225
There is another small step, which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for Yugoslavia.	1.1979163173943146
For about 10 years, the situation in the area has been fluid.	1.4065468030417798
Both as an historical period and, in particular, as a political period, 10 years is a very long time.	1.5727614047243286
Under those conditions, then, there has been a real failure.	1.0795215318072897
In that sense, the agreement we will be voting on tomorrow, which contributes towards stability in the area, is de facto a move in the right direction.	1.3756443276121417
In essence, FYROM is a miniature version of the former Yugoslavia, regardless of where one or another minority holds supremacy.	1.0056062086285602
From that standpoint, the fact that so far it has resisted any influences from its wider environment is a very positive element and under no circumstances should any of us, any State, any policy or any view, impel that small republic towards external, disruptive movements in an effort to solve other problems, granted - let it be noted - that it has institutions which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy.	1.3407484225486088
In that area, there have been various policies from time to time, and what the European Union should guard against is the risk that, for ultimately superficial reasons, it may help to create banana republics elsewhere.	1.5638946045653064
We must be sure that, in seeking allies in the area, we must not always choose anyone who offers.	1.48405161656864
We must choose those which are moderate, which have breadth of vision and which have a perception of peace and stability in the area.	1.2857657430143983
I hope and wish, and am indeed certain, that the European Union, with maturity and with the measures it has begun to adopt, will little by little construct, in the wider area, the necessary environment which it needs itself.	1.5438965311949775
Let us not deceive ourselves: a Europe, one part of which is being held back because of frictions, misinterpretations and conflicts, and because of nationalistic clashes, will never be a Europe that has brought its own house to the level it wants.	1.5665277324657105
In any event, speaking now as a Greek, I want to tell some of the speakers I listened to earlier that much of what was said is fixated on other times and places.	1.1855118173108727
They have quite failed to grasp the new conditions created in the area; the new and positive conditions which have been created, in very many cases on Greece' s initiative.	1.441012249485681
You should know that the country which cooperates most with FYROM and has the best relations with it, in the entire area, is Greece, and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area.	1.4239374362285528
I say this just so that we know where we stand.	1.3863079214320573
. This has been a very interesting general debate about the Balkans as a whole.	1.2446768141339157
It was none the worse for that, but perhaps I will be forgiven for concentrating very largely on the report because there are some extremely important issues that I want to touch on.	1.3928023877374347
I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission's position on the report.	1.3767195423233995
It is very helpful.	1.1589604880767628
It is an excellent contribution by Mr Swoboda and his colleagues.	1.3441797446529378
We are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues, a number of whom are in the House this evening - Mrs Pack, Mr Lagendijk and others.	1.4567147562433491
I am very pleased that at our overall relations with FYROM are in such a good state.	1.1016648794829547
Perhaps Mr Dupuis will forgive me for using that expression - both he and his interpreter - in the spirit of entente cordiale.	1.1878336972099697
That has been helped by our excellent European Union representative in the country.	0.9810139353907253
He has been a great friend to Parliament and a great servant of the Commission.	1.2623865126749847
The imminent commencement of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement is the most powerful example of our good relations.	1.1651840470488795
So to is the cooperation of FYROM in the rebuilding of Kosovo.	0.8942796067495068
I am grateful to the authorities in Macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in Kosovo.	1.0688620021902837
Like honourable Members I recognise the stabilising role that this country has played during the Balkan tragedy, in particular when it comes to integrating the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country.	1.4048060859859728
I saw the newly-elected President Georgievski a few weeks ago and I was extremely impressed, as others have been, by his commitment to multi-ethnicity and pluralism.	1.2392686697424633
Let me set out where matters now stand on these negotiations to which - as Mr Lagendijk said - other countries in the region are looking with very considerable interest.	1.2541225246359666
The Council adopted on 24 January this year its negotiating directives for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	0.6584900890206714
This represents the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process of the western Balkans region initiated by the Commission in May 1999.	1.288677272137977
Let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives.	0.9345938398000254
They cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with FYROM.	0.9540278340492069
They cover provisions for enhanced regional cooperation including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region, though I must make it clear that there is no question of any attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia.	1.1240351975697673
They cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the European Union and them within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement.	1.173901742360249
They cover provisions on the movement of workers, freedom of establishment, supply of services, current payments and movement of capital.	0.9423707316178179
They cover a commitment by FYROM to approximate its legislation to that of the European Community, notably in key areas of the internal market; and they cover provisions on cooperation with FYROM in a wide range of fields, including justice and home affairs.	1.2685553951549742
We are now making in the Commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in March.	1.3213795894865632
I am due to visit FYROM in the second week in March.	0.9658362354849941
I hope to be able to set the process in motion then, although the formal negotiations will start very shortly thereafter.	1.2567194165191522
At the time of that visit I will also, as recommended by honourable Members and others, be upgrading our representation in FYROM.	1.2977744818048638
The target date for concluding the negotiations is December this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators.	1.0098890206027784
The agreement could enter into force in three to four years from now, given the time needed for ratification in Member States' parliaments.	1.2073465042283273
I should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution.	1.263510403853101
We accept that the agreement should to a certain extent serve as an example for other such agreements, although obviously we will also want to take account of the fact that we are dealing with different countries, each of which has its own identity and its own concerns.	1.3404649612935988
I share the wide-spread concern that we should treat each country on its merits and not shackle everyone to the pace of the slowest in the development of relations with the Union.	1.0983978550169027
That has never been the intention.	0.792242128211712
The very fact that negotiations are beginning first with FYROM, before all the others, is evidence that we can and do differentiate.	1.404392888325007
On the provision of regional aid referred to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to projects having a cross-border or regional dimension.	1.167770807751595
We agree that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of EU membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement.	0.9534033273146826
It will reflect the European Union's position on its relations with the countries of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusions.	1.1992917264579248
We strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent.	0.8521463778788789
As for the arrangements covering European Union assistance to the western Balkans, Members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and streamline their management and to put everything under one regulation.	1.2965109938797847
I am aware that there is concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and, especially, at the loss of association with the PHARE name.	1.2512665022550558
I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score.	0.8279372144374996
I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion.	1.165305116274042
I want to stress, however, that whatever the programme is called, our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbours into the European family is stronger than ever.	1.3774688469443441
In general I trust that Members of this House will share my pleasure that Macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly.	1.0698445172908182
I hope that the other countries of the region will redouble their efforts to make similar progress.	1.2968073661651032
I look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking, I hope, the success of what we are trying to do in the Balkans which, for me, remains the single most important litmus-test of what Europe is able to do on its own doorstep.	1.36770374141945
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	0.618741388554918
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	0.251962532894286
Agreement on comitology	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the implementation of the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 on comitology (1999/468/EC).	0.9883075457211369
. (IT) Mr President, the approval of this agreement with the Commission on procedures for implementing the Council decision on comitology marks the end of a saga which has kept Parliament busy for two years, along with a few enthusiasts scattered among the various institutions of the Union, whom many people do not hesitate to call masochists.	1.2675667916254727
Until 1993, the way the Commission exercised its executive powers, and in particular the mysterious and even suspect committee arrangements, was creating conflict and mistrust between the institutions, and threatening to have serious consequences on the legislative procedure.	1.3280410593144192
That is why, in accordance with Declaration No 31, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union institutions have undertaken a complex task of negotiation and consultation, resulting in the new Council decision, which revises the old system quite substantially, although we are not entirely satisfied with it.	1.318701110075556
In particular, the decision outlines a form of parliamentary control whereby Parliament can sound the alarm if an implementing measure, deriving from an act adopted under the codecision procedure, oversteps the implementing powers delegated to the Commission.	1.0045437686162302
During the protracted interinstitutional negotiations - which saw Parliament actively involved, thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Adelaide Aglietta - it was understood that the European Parliament and Commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedures for implementing certain aspects of the new decision. On the one hand, certain points which the Council did not intend to incorporate into the decision were to be made explicit and, on the other, the system for providing information about implementing measures and monitoring them was to be organised more precisely.	1.4114156632852195
During the trialogue held on 6 October 1999 in Strasbourg, the Presidents of the European Parliament and the Commission approved the idea of concluding this agreement soon.	1.2185426900872303
We believe we have respected that commitment, and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the Commission.	1.135168134711951
Essentially, the agreement deals with two points: one is the right of the European Parliament to be informed, which is the sine qua non for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to Article 8 of the decision.	1.370633514310733
Hitherto, such information had been supplied on paper and unsystematically, and was of no use to our services; and indeed this was often the fault of Parliament itself.	1.288576349722164
From now on, the information will be provided by means of an electronic system called CIRCA, to which the European Parliament will have access. This represents a real innovation, not only for us, but also - I am sure - for the Commission.	1.5667235109391575
The other point is that Article 8 of the Council decision does not specify either the method by which the European Parliament is to sound the alarm, or the time limit within which it must exercise its restricted power of control.	1.3789354820522364
Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement confirm that, as a general rule, the European Parliament will adopt its resolution, stating its reasons, at a plenary sitting and has one month to exercise its right of intervention before the Commission adopts the draft implementing measure.	1.3682619999077295
But we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure.	1.3182009904846899
Therefore, the agreement contains explicit provisions on urgent procedure, including possible action by the committee responsible.	1.530000154710527
I want to end by stressing that we cannot assess whether this is a good agreement or not, we must wait and see how it works in practice.	1.4603246708709632
The European Parliament needs to acquire the resources, which it currently lacks, to ensure efficient monitoring of implementing measures, and the Commission must accept that some of its practices need reorganising to provide proper information to Parliament and ensure that control can be effective.	1.5028360136800822
Finally, it needs to be borne in mind that - whatever happens - the real solution to the problems of comitology for the European Parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the Treaties, and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an anomaly that severely restricts the Commission' s executive power and may prejudice the European Parliament' s legislative powers.	1.402291736078658
Mr President, comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means.	1.24772553249717
It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies, which is the way things used to be.	1.2170536645015704
In fact, it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission.	1.0874853892861596
The procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures.	0.9297160373078823
Up until the Amsterdam Treaty, there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures, which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens.	1.277438365496939
On the contrary, for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed.	1.681821071553051
For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees.	1.5622438979289897
Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors.	0.9098349152014832
A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases.	1.347475655376032
It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny.	0.7509952444700824
With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced - as the European Parliament had long wanted - to three procedures, the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure.	1.468098859372836
Now, following the Amsterdam Treaty, the rights of information and control granted to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement.	1.440602299435737
Mrs Frassoni, our rapporteur, has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within Parliament.	1.4559731385822636
A key problem is the time factor.	1.077093069475444
When the European Parliament is informed, it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks, should it so wish.	1.4637893953796801
In matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be in a position to react very rapidly, if necessary within a few hours or days.	1.4792357074924676
Nevertheless, the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react.	1.429747835335617
Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties, which I and my group can only support in full.	1.210001800908123
I just have one more request.	0.8373033851905962
In the German version, paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather misleadingly and I urgently ask for clarification, which I would also like to see in the printed version later.	1.2797136810973597
In my view, instead of "weitergeführt werden müssen" the wording should be "erhalten bleiben müssen" .	0.8340531769952404
The German version is not very clear here.	1.0784301611511609
I would ask for that to be checked again.	1.279302381063666
For the rest, I warmly thank our rapporteur.	1.219143178992517
It is a difficult subject and I hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now.	1.5083971615232596
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report.	1.1594898175638373
I must add that it is a welcome change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions.	1.1820427306484582
When it comes to the IGC, she is one of what the French call "les pures et dures" : no compromise, no deals with the other institutions; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions.	1.2840445516328605
Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament' s original position on the issue of comitology.	1.2293012495433766
Let us remember what is at stake here.	0.8915238876340896
Parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new Council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement.	1.0092666066633436
Firstly, the whole system is obscure.	1.6123887510101913
It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees.	1.1192444145248763
Here is a real step forward, in the new system that has been agreed.	1.6556907171021285
We are to know who is on each committee.	1.2825271883860456
We are to know when they meet.	1.101898138585999
We are to get the agendas.	1.0232725907832303
We are to get the documents that are sent to them.	1.049402168134552
The whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex.	1.3408633869667355
So that is at least a step forward.	1.205990397206274
Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission.	0.991689163640164
We adopt legislation in the European Union.	0.6582810304879244
We expect the Commission to implement it.	0.9227472215566941
And then we have a system designed to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the "contre-filet" system, under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned.	1.325335025338603
Here too there is at least some progress.	1.0143838941636922
The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States represented in the Council.	1.220066827547357
That is a more reasonable system.	1.164349393472366
That, too, is a step forward.	1.2594112130345392
But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied.	1.2480433462587344
The first criticism is of the system whereby the Commission is monitored, scrutinised, controlled if you like, only by a committee appointed by Member States or the Council not by Parliament.	1.4001097544746823
The legislative authority, Council and Parliament, should be equal.	1.0203497475607752
We confer implementing powers on the Commission, but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure.	1.398515468882517
Parliament has no equivalent power.	0.698388717370586
True, we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system.	1.526603842462385
We are to receive all the draft implementing measures forwarded to a committee at the same time as it is sent to the committee.	1.4525626997090335
We will have the chance to scrutinise, to debate, to question.	1.5477682969528954
But we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the Commission in the legislation.	1.4543337870714592
In other words, we can challenge the measure for being ultra-vires but not on its content.	1.1208477894263036
And in a democracy, Parliament should be able to challenge the content.	1.2958203482443333
Not that we do so every week.	1.2702794754562017
We are not seeking to immerse ourselves in implementing decisions, but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary.	1.4515971002569756
That is lacking in this new system, or at least is only there in embryonic form.	1.1122870260985052
Finally, our fourth criticism is that if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system it is referred back, not to both branches of the legislative authority, but to the Council alone, which has the right possibly to take an alternative measure.	1.508139150897845
That is not correct.	0.9725596981148759
Both branches adopt the legislation - Council and Parliament - that confers implementing powers on the Commission.	1.1643469252547358
If such implementing measures are referred back, it should be to both branches, not to one branch alone.	1.3493004436506257
Overall we have a system which has made some progress.	1.4016307188522104
The supplementary aspects that arise from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but that could not change the basic decision of the Council.	1.3854641032682262
Even here, we have renounced voluntarily - because this did not happen automatically - the Plumb-Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise.	1.542179849158043
We have been willing to relinquish the provisions in that.	0.9651541771316733
We shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision.	1.3253311902106724
We must be very vigilant.	1.0975792321234101
So it is a step forward.	1.0487785686935334
My group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward.	0.8493111413650348
We are not as enthusiastic about compromising as Mrs Frassoni.	1.0426305322828262
We recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years' time.	1.1795497347262665
If we want a Union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject.	1.1585263845326015
Mr President, first I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, for her work.	1.4490958114151196
It is never easy working on comitology.	0.6815663808513623
Mrs Schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic, something we have long talked about.	1.054204618538924
Certainly the process has always been very complex, as a result of historical decisions, and these must eventually be rationalised.	1.3658465512494522
In my opinion, the agreement reached between Commission and Parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process.	1.378695815767551
From our point of view, it satisfies the fundamental interests of Parliament.	1.1596842999445554
Mr Corbett set out Parliament' s concerns.	0.7125591566498668
He says some of them have been satisfied and others have not.	1.16961924780261
I would say the ones the Commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied.	1.3089399254327847
Mr Corbett is raising issues the Council decision does not cover, and unfortunately we can go no further on those.	1.2388995930928939
So how far have we come?	0.7056132692142649
There is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point, highlighted by Mrs Frassoni, given that we now have an automatic information system.	1.2824563924976426
This will facilitate two activities Parliament is especially interested in.	0.8406277240550936
One is knowing how the committees operate, about their composition, agendas, descriptions, and so on, and the other is the right of scrutiny over actual decisions.	1.295695327654792
I think this is a good agreement.	1.1855073095250452
It is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process.	1.0854555908423758
From here on things are going to be easier.	1.0152529971014572
But the agreement we are reaching today should not be regarded as a backward step compared with the Plumb/Delors Agreement.	0.9110806762028265
Mr Corbett referred to that, but the new model is certainly much more complex, different because the situation is now different, and, in our opinion, much more coherent.	1.3798737055259638
We have made a start, and we hope the work will produce some excellent results.	1.430009419363462
We think there are other positive advances too.	0.9515342260036389
To a certain extent we have gone beyond agreements which are already dated and, by realigning old procedures with the new situation, we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past.	1.3635171088639069
From the Commission' s point of view, our conclusion is that this is a good agreement, and we want to thank the Members of Parliament who worked on it - especially Mrs Frassoni.	1.5849510412470404
We hope that this new climate means we have achieved the result we were seeking, which is greater transparency and better information about the decisions of the Commission as an executive.	1.4906537266225464
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	0.7098551447841881
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	0.251962532894286
Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure	0.11878342076023396
The next item is the report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS))	0.7015578762562982
Mr President, I am also pleased to welcome the Spanish Commissioner, Mr Solbes Mira, whom I have congratulated more than once, inside and outside this Parliament, on the excellent work he did in Spain on the subject of European convergence.	1.416149817151765
The proposal for an amendment to this regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure, annexed to the Treaty of Maastricht, raises fundamental issues concerning the switch to the 1995 European system of accounts, which, as you know, replaced the previous System of Accounts adopted in 1979, and in particular the emergence of new financial product categories, consistency in the calculation of the ratios of government deficit to gross domestic product on the basis of ESA 95 and, finally, recognising the importance of calculating interest expenditure and the consistency of the latter with this new methodology.	1.138720284024994
In our view, the main purpose of the proposal for a regulation is to update the definitions and the assessments of some of the economic operations involved in the calculation of deficits, as reflected in the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Treaty of Maastricht, which lays down the maximum percentages which the government deficit must not exceed as a ratio of GDP at market prices in the various Member States.	1.2621540471034245
To date, the Member States have calculated this GDP in accordance with the criteria laid down in ESA 79.	1.2522541109251426
The most recent estimate of the deficit was submitted in September 1999 and it relates to the 1998 financial year.	1.0388327701732556
Therefore, if the regulation is adopted, the estimate which is due to appear in March 2000, the first estimate of the deficit for the 1999 accounting year, will be made using the new system.	1.4193185540133955
We know the Member States have done their duty - if I can use that expression - doing their calculations and preparing their national accounts in line with ESA 95, and they have already published their corresponding estimates.	1.4289108188576023
In addition to incorporating a new methodology, this has meant making slight changes to most accounting aggregates and operations, on account of the aforesaid methodological changes, and also the improved statistical information included in the estimates.	1.29236717320967
These changes may of course alter the government deficits in terms of the Member States' national accounting.	1.1803494308555909
I will now describe, very briefly, the five areas where the most important changes may occur.	1.4476799839120262
First, the adjustments to the scope of what is meant by 'government institutional sector' under ESA 95.	1.1352023256964137
This is important, since government deficit means the deficit accumulated by all forms of government.	1.109145398715866
The non-availability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the Member States' government deficits.	1.092361598521023
Secondly, the deficit - or, if applicable, the surplus - means the ESA 95 government sector' s net borrowing requirement or lending ability respectively	1.299472374494814
Thirdly, government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector, as defined in ESA 95.	1.4586431611389274
Fourthly, government debt is defined in accordance with ESA 95, as are the flows or interest stemming from assets/liabilities.	1.161415093782775
Fifthly and finally, the aggregate to which government debt will relate will be gross domestic product at current market prices, estimated in accordance with the 1995 European System of Accounts' definitions.	1.0424441550769035
To summarise, I consider that this proposal constitutes a satisfactory adaptation of the criteria laid down in the 1995 European System of Accounts, and I therefore approve it in full, as did the committee.	1.3779534918611738
Mr President, Commissioner, let me say at the outset that my group welcomes this proposal because it makes the basic statistical data for an economic and monetary union directed at stability and real growth more harmonised, directly comparable and more accurate.	1.239185081718334
We have already heard about the various aspects involved.	1.1559922741020061
What I think is crucial is that henceforth the statistical data will be more reliable and comparable.	0.9430618808424615
We need that because the various European Union bodies and all the Member States within monetary union have to be able to depend on one another.	1.2367210101196089
It is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons.	1.0589430463383793
Firstly, for the single market.	1.7334355869188387
It is most important quite generally in a single market to have reliable and directly comparable data and statistics so as to give an accurate picture of the situation and development trends.	1.265902448704513
Secondly, for economic and monetary union.	1.6451133528186193
The regulation dating from 1993 on the application of the Protocol must be brought into harmony with the methodology of the European system of accounts at national and regional level.	1.1029794215617434
That is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits.	0.8558792754887837
This adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the Member States more precisely.	0.9727368924466915
These technical changes will have a very real impact on the actual position of the countries, since the data will automatically be amended in line with the public deficit.	1.5023971340451356
I also welcome the fact that the estimates of the deficits for the 1999 financial year that are due to be published in March 2000 are already based on the new ESA, i.e. the analysis is based on consolidated aggregates that are economically relevant.	1.2148218291590132
Let me also briefly use this debate as an opportunity to urge all the governments and political parties to do their utmost to ensure that this procedure never has to be initiated for an excessive deficit.	1.2067210563643314
It is good that the procedure exists.	0.9295403304880336
We need it because it lends our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility.	0.82080529428444
The citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met.	0.9109566518515182
Thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously.	1.2206203761021248
Another important point is that we must do all we can, not just to prevent excessive deficits, but also to further reduce public deficits.	1.4405193370586076
I know what I am talking about and I will conclude by telling you why I am so glad we are holding this debate!	1.2387376095738782
We are currently holding a debate in my own country on whether the former minister for finance actually gave us accurate information on the deficit.	1.156382433946342
In my country, Austria, new elections had to be held in 1995 in order to meet the Maastricht criteria and persuade our political partner to rethink his approach.	1.0552683807149377
I must also tell you that in the year 2000, when there is so much talk about us, the coalition talks with the SPÖ failed - and unfortunately so - because the Socialist Party brought down the negotiated austerity and consolidation programme.	1.4340494124804055
That is a prime reason why the new government had to be formed in Austria; for the Austrian People' s Party, the ÖVP, wants to continue to act as guarantor of economic stability. The ÖVP wants to ensure that we continue to meet the Maastricht criteria and reduce the public deficit, as we have agreed here.	1.4390119559196572
Mr President, the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable.	1.2677268405677329
This is of great importance, especially in the light of European unification and the completion of the internal market.	1.0379028656596594
This is why this report is also so politically charged: a report, by the way, on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly.	1.6511170763113054
It also inspires a few political comments.	0.7297086382212834
The Stability Pact is a given in Europe.	0.9473161923065209
All countries participating in the euro have committed themselves, in the medium term, to striving towards a budget which is either balanced or shows up a slight surplus.	1.1854303992454422
This, of course, does not mean that, if the economic climate is less than favourable, the budget could not fluctuate up or down slightly. It means that, in the long and medium term, there should be a balance or surplus.	1.5044674938239897
The stronger the position of the participating countries, the stronger the euro will be.	1.1847861737031788
As a result, the three percent standard will rarely be exceeded, not even in a bad economic climate.	1.247009304041758
This is the theory behind it, anyway.	1.1691261544263096
We have always been of the opinion that these criteria should be stringently met.	1.1718453385870344
That is of great importance in order to turn the EMU into a success, now and in the future.	1.1807924386923974
Strict compliance with the Stability Pact can thus contribute to a culture of stability within all EMU Member States.	0.9438057220534326
Various Member States have taken one-off measures to be able to meet the criteria.	1.2052423925136737
We are of the opinion that the Member States' budget policy should be strictly supervised, to ensure that the measures continue to be taken in the spirit of the prescribed criteria at all times.	1.2995308933773337
A drop in standards should not be allowed.	0.7121976753937529
We are also of the opinion that a further reduction in the burden and reducing the national debt should be prioritised.	1.2402658631199097
Indeed, we still have not managed to stop passing on the burden to future generations.	1.2422215058651567
. (ES) Mr President, many thanks, first of all, to the rapporteur for his splendid work.	1.2489301533528019
It was a subject which called for a large dose of technical skill and I think Mr Knörr has handled it with great precision and professionalism.	1.1875164036923573
I would not presume to be able to summarise the content of our proposal better than he has done; I would just like to add one small point: in addition to adaptation to ESA 95, there are two small technical changes which Mr Knörr knows all about, relating to interest and the valuation of debt in foreign currency.	1.2387426441572542
I just mention that to complete the view of the process.	0.9990078306855587
Secondly, I would like to thank Mr Knörr for his speediness.	1.2069777375178081
He has done really good work in a very short time.	1.1627645940770872
This is an important subject for certain references which we have heard subsequently.	1.3157909627902449
What we are seeking with this legislation is not to make the statistics reliable and comparable - they already are - but to make them more reliable and more comparable.	1.4996713538092359
Obviously, the fact that Parliament has taken its decision so quickly will mean that the March figures can already be calculated on the basis of these new criteria.	1.2382179161309002
That being so, I believe the final result will be better.	1.4316675138732022
The figures will be more reliable and more comparable and I think the concerns some Members have raised about compliance with the stability pact can be better addressed.	1.1765908080094745
This regulation is purely instrumental.	0.7887996725244425
It does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised.	1.046148002847371
But we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem.	1.0055154210416148
The stability pact is in place and we will continue to press ahead with monitoring compliance by the various Member States, despite the fact that the results are clearly positive in all the Member States where we have analysed the position as regards the stability of the government deficit.	1.357613428540142
But we see no reason to lower our guard.	0.8623610304248406
We must press on in that direction because we know it is vital.	1.3324143299239208
So, once again - and finally - I want to thank you for your help in allowing us to measure stability with greater technical certainty and better comparability.	1.4277863024733501
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	0.7098551447841881
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	0.251962532894286
Increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting of the euro	0.6435411304396936
The next item is the report (A5-0020/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on a draft Framework Decision of the Council on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro (5116/1999 - C5-0332/1999 - 1999/0821(CNS)).	0.8294447245397074
.	-0.0
(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen (all the more welcome for being so few in number), one might have thought that it was an unimportant subject which was to be discussed at this hour, but that is not the case.	1.34437221243639
It is a definite and concrete issue. It is about our common currency.	1.6796298713922442
How many people here know that this currency is being counterfeited and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affairs?	1.3686836415590298
We cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited.	0.8765816314446818
The ECB, ECOFIN, Europol, OLAF and the Commissioner responsible for legal questions have therefore realised that common countermeasures must be taken quickly in order to close the loopholes left by the legislation.	1.1068635683639372
It is easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currencies for twenty years after the new currency has been introduced.	1.0168830349953726
It is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions.	1.1810076000907899
This is something which Parliament has said it wants to see added.	1.064968802442837
The Council ought to have given Parliament the stipulated three-month period within which to consider, too, the last document produced on this matter, but we are all aware of how urgent it is to have these measures put safely in place.	1.3470454487275902
Because the issue is to be decided upon in March in the Council, Parliament has cause to adopt a position on the proposal now, so that the Member States have time also to take due account of Parliament' s points of view in the decision which has to be made in March.	1.5300413534693666
Any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency, and that country would be accountable, both morally and economically, if its actions were to contribute to a delay.	1.3450263226463575
A country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself.	1.088000447008648
On 1 January 2002 the euro will be in circulation.	0.9629482876233506
The whole of the Union must have the same protection, a type of protection which prohibits counterfeiting, not only of currencies in circulation but also of currencies which will be in circulation.	1.562637389577395
It is important that, in time, there should be a more or less similar-looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries.	1.3754435980271082
The Commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information, together with penal sanctions, preventive measures and the pooling of experience.	1.058908618399262
These measures do, in fact, entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years' imprisonment.	1.1218047023835331
Trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences.	0.840559200025288
Quite simply, we are to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty.	1.3791041044539423
The denominations of the euro are well known.	1.0055794975426813
Modern computer equipment can be used to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves.	1.2597932564656305
Parliament has tabled a number of amendments to the present proposal, for example in regard to jurisdiction, the idea being that a person may only be prosecuted and sentenced in the one country for the same crime.	1.4569690029050053
There are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting, this being a measure which we would encourage.	1.3525638302788647
The new applicant States are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations.	0.9521739036675196
It has taken two years for the Council and the Commission to produce this proposal.	1.2863383130659973
It is essential that the decision should now be taken in March.	1.2508994907455626
To delay, or perhaps even risk damage to the euro, would be indefensible.	1.3283497431844262
It would also be a betrayal of the people who will be handling the new, unfamiliar notes.	1.0961290303505777
In particular, it is believed that counterfeiters will turn their attention to countries outside the euro zone, where people are less familiar with the new currency.	1.2905970920090286
The protective measures cover these countries too, and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight.	1.2724163626583305
The present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character, accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others.	1.007349391101349
The Council must now convene in March and make the relevant decision.	1.1417384643444886
Thank you for listening.	1.054947780889572
Thank you, too, those who contributed to this matter' s being dealt with swiftly. I am thinking in particular of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.	1.1418046798273807
Mr President, first I want to compliment the rapporteur, Charlotte Cederschiöld, on drawing up this report, which is an excellent point of departure for increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro.	1.2090247064187039
The euro will enter into circulation on 1 January 2002 and will become one of the world' s most important reserve currencies.	1.1146189236904778
Due to its importance on a world scale, the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery.	1.1897019422175619
This draft decision therefore lays down a set of minimum standards intended to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each Member State simpler and more effective.	1.0645896010638611
It also provides for the euro to be protected even prior to its circulation, which will fill a gap in legislation in some Member States.	1.2311060302428996
I expressly support the rapporteur as regards the need to extend this protection to national currencies which can continue to be exchanged after they have been withdrawn from circulation.	1.078233842327616
This means that every Member State must guarantee the establishment of effective, adequate penal sanctions, which act as a deterrent against the offences covered by the draft framework decision.	1.239669996367078
As to the proposal to establish a maximum custodial sentence of not less than eight years, I do not think that this will raise any problems as far as my country is concerned, even though the maximum sentence for counterfeiting under its criminal code is currently five years in prison, as it has already expressed willingness to make this amendment.	1.447658917442547
I also call on those few Member States still harbouring reservations to resolve them so that a decision can rapidly be reached on this matter, for the reasons our rapporteur set out earlier when she called for this to be done.	1.1589663616977934
Mr President, this draft framework decision represents the first time a common proposal on crime has been put forward, with legislation to be applied by all fifteen Member States at the same time.	1.5003811551336326
We are therefore making progress towards the aim of developing and confirming the status of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, as expressed at Tampere.	1.213500297671223
Mr President, I need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points Mr Coelho made. All that is indeed very true and correct.	1.3695642146496991
It is easy to counterfeit the euro.	0.695958879332793
We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history.	1.1510766671335266
It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already. Yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such, counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence.	1.4330225952574895
It is a highly complex problem.	1.3473329348676522
If we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschiöld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation.	1.1383026428298642
Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people.	1.0241715223809704
So what is the European Union doing about it?	1.3280092649392707
It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschiöld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschiöld, but more at the procedures that are being applied.	1.3951725808871587
The manner in which the Council, which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy.	1.3157715716292142
We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment.	1.4661311513964657
Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months.	1.3266177935144252
It is only thanks to the immense efforts of Mrs Cederschiöld and to Parliament' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages, that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the Council, so that the decision scheduled for March can indeed be taken.	1.4002754628141068
On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us.	1.0693363154034392
So let me state quite clearly here, on behalf of my group, that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschiöld whether it is reasonable to work like this.	1.1664331711570468
We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure.	1.450598522805738
This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress.	0.8847965778272477
Only, as Mrs Cederschiöld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited.	1.3894249553957079
One reason they have not been dealt with is that as ever the leopard cannot change its spots, i.e. in the case of this framework decision, which specifically relates to judicial cooperation, the Council once again prefers to adhere to the level of government cooperation.	1.238806083896574
That is why, and I quote, this framework decision "is confined to supplementing the provisions of the International Convention of 20 April 1929 for the suppression of counterfeiting and its Protocol" , i.e. the provisions of a timeworn international convention that is a good 71 years old.	1.2746152839973086
That means that the legal basis we are now seeking to establish to protect the euro does not derive from Community legislation, as it should, but merely takes the form of provisions supplementing an international convention dating back 71 years.	1.395821684364428
I leave it to the assembled company in this Chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a European Union based on judicial cooperation.	1.3631507062761246
Thank you for your attention during our night sitting together.	0.9507497754546002
Mr President, the launch of the euro could well be a heaven-sent opportunity for counterfeiters.	1.184655727148496
The fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references, and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article.	1.2938637682701635
So the Council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions, primarily criminal, applicable in all the countries of Europe, against offences of this kind.	1.2679930729771847
No doubt the Council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that Member States adopt national legislation to that effect.	1.0619805704012988
That is what I would have preferred, personally.	1.5555457062892069
But, probably through lack of confidence in the zeal of certain members, the Council has preferred to implement a legal instrument which is more binding at European level: a framework decision.	1.3420631470741415
Now that is where the difficulties begin, because criminal law comes under national sovereignty and the Treaty of Maastricht contains no specific provision covering this situation for the euro - so as not to frighten the voters by over-egging the pudding.	1.2717769161706243
The draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this lacuna by referring to Articles 31 and 34(2)(b) of the Treaty.	0.927218763622409
However, I find these passports inadequate.	1.4341320007392457
Article 31 only envisages minimum common rules for criminal acts in certain cases, specifically restricted to organised crime, terrorism and drug trafficking.	1.035282233394339
Counterfeiting is not on the list.	0.7627462632490529
Article 34, a product of the Treaty of Amsterdam, only lays down the new form of a framework decision, and clearly this only applies to the existing powers of the European Union.	1.3435013791066026
So we come back to the previous problem.	0.9325931165514771
In other words, the Council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis.	1.146973769774155
In a way, this is deferred punishment for its lack of honesty, at the time, in presenting the Maastricht Treaty to the voters.	1.4397478288861092
I would also like to make a more general point.	1.171432830159194
Not so long ago we were dealing with one or more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part-session.	1.119536661009728
But there has been nothing for a year.	1.004767182827767
Just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting.	0.8219021249682127
The Commission' s communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, which we have debated this week, contained absolutely nothing on this vast subject, except the reminder, in a single line, that the euro coins and notes are due to come into circulation on 1 January 2002.	1.2777439995711646
However, there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved.	1.3789833936057148
Let us mention, for example, the disturbing lack of public interest, the definition of monetary policy objectives abusively reduced to the mere fight against inflation, the strange coupling of monetary federalism to a lack budgetary or fiscal federalism, the status of the present applicant countries, when they become members, vis-à-vis the euro zone, the confused reaction of the international markets to this currency with no homogeneous popular foundation, and so on. Do I also need to mention that investors who sold dollars to buy euros have lost 20% since 1 January 1999, 40% if they bought bonds, and no less than 55% if they sold yen to buy euros?	1.2966410234826466
Mr President, for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money.	1.3039879169238706
These are gigantic problems but they seem to be taboo here.	0.7706891822236912
I should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker.	1.4008624883886645
There are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions, because the point of departure is, of course, that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern.	1.2714182876367883
Criminal law is part of each individual nation' s own cultural tradition, and it is very difficult to arrive at common definitions of what is to be understood by these basic legal concepts.	1.2488239401530612
I appreciate Mrs Cederschiöld' s work, and my point of departure will be her search - in connection with the Tampere Summit - for common definitions and common regulations regarding what is punishable and what common sanctions can be applied.	1.4477668069050351
She would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the EU.	1.1400376405438284
But the problem is that there is no legal basis for this, and with good reason, because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction.	1.3493692624164506
In that context, I want to ask the following question of the Commission' s and the Council' s representatives: is the legal basis which has been invoked adequate?	1.6566076573490458
In my view, it is clearly in conflict with, and far exceeds the scope of, Article 34, paragraph 2, point b where a legal basis is established for so-called framework decisions which are binding upon the Member States in regard to the desired objectives, but in which it is left to the national authorities to determine the form and methods of implementation.	1.451510666139643
What of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the Member States' obligations are laid down in detail. There is no freedom of choice regarding methods and implementation.	1.3676018518618336
In my view, this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis.	1.1380940886425286
I should like an answer from the Commission and the Council, for I consider it obvious that Article 31 does not supply the relevant legal basis.	1.3710610182429777
Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that, in her report, she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes, which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now, to supplement and improve the text.	1.3183536822389126
It is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to spoil this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting - and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made.	1.3289196862239308
We have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it.	0.9797145353721629
So, in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting, to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions, the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do.	1.5478700918960178
We are also concerned with the question of cooperation.	1.1563899790731276
We need to define the precise responsibilities of the ECB, the national central banks, the Commission and Europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro.	1.3735985046344485
I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work.	1.0373980948636934
In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities.	1.3287235263895263
Aside from the report, which we welcome, many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved.	1.3505220037402106
I hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification.	1.1361078857649989
Mr President, Mrs Cederschiöld, ladies and gentlemen, how safe is the euro?	1.3645438599931607
That is, after all, a question the people often ask.	1.1596952778112217
And that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 January 2002, the date when they will have euros in their pockets.	1.2082859290149757
For the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but, in fact, also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	1.4255561437469526
That too is a concern of the people, for, as has rightly been said, this will be a new currency for them, new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used.	1.5334909169038617
Of course all the citizens of the EU Member States will also be faced with the novelty of a currency that is valid over such a wider area, and even beyond Europe, as a reserve currency.	1.434740182201372
They will need time to get used to that too.	0.8945394319902302
So it is clearly necessary to ask what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting.	1.238182017770611
And that is what we are discussing at this late hour.	1.1627407086197743
This really is a subject that is close to the citizen, so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour.	1.442467845779878
But that cannot be helped.	0.5895573599587061
Of course, the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time.	1.2898442999619077
After all, it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting.	1.2063473703634846
As has also been pointed out, in summer 1998 the Commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken, such as information, further training - an important area, cooperation between the euro-states and of course even beyond them, and measures under criminal law.	1.4332282836025108
That is what this framework decision is about.	1.2204559828002064
Mrs Cederschiöld, let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the Commission and, above all, let me also thank Parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time.	1.236613509746507
I certainly appreciate that.	0.6288202390879523
The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences.	1.1658552773417215
Of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and, as was emphasised, what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced.	1.426430565206284
Naturally, the Commission is also glad that the European Parliament' s prompt decision - and I hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now, so that we can begin to transpose it.	1.4787670266826989
For the Commission has been asked to report, as it will in the first half of next year, on the progress in transposing it in the Member States, on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action.	1.6640403077315926
It has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law.	1.3480437520819781
In that respect we must recognise this innovation, this step, even if, as Mr Schulz just pointed out, simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step.	1.4375150213051089
In reply to the question whether the Commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the Treaty, the Commission believes that the right basis is being applied here.	1.4336267571421397
The framework decision will, however, have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future.	1.2349046237369952
The Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with Europol.	1.2046135741033897
That proposal will establish a duty to cooperate, and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify Europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, so that effective measures can then be taken.	1.3561023862968782
On the question of coordinating the various measures, since early 1998, the Commission, followed now by OLAF, has been working with experts on the subject from the Member States, the European Central Bank and Europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance.	1.4360576761868922
As Mr Karas just pointed out, a few weeks ago the Commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro, to which it proposed allocating as much as EUR 32 million.	1.4140437114551567
That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	1.2211875682214963
I believe that this debate shortly before midnight will also teach a salutary lesson to all those counterfeiters who believe their hour has come, because they think the EU is no longer awake at this late hour!	1.2901437802460989
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.	0.6645382420525882
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	0.251962532894286
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)	0.5012001247970661
Resumption of the sitting	0.6212265099123361
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	0.3735514178617478
Are there any comments?	0.1337831580886173
(The Minutes were approved)	0.08791063492812108
Mr President, I should like make a comment in connection with a meeting held last night by various Members of Parliament from all groups.	1.2827671981592925
The purpose of the meeting, which was attended by several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, together with the architects who designed this building, was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions.	1.2213236451440521
We discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you, Mr President, in fact conceals a huge window which, if the curtain were drawn back, would afford a wonderful view over the river.	1.316158006087254
We were told that the curtain was closed so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the lighting during debates.	1.1785017326876956
But what is to prevent us, before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting, opening the curtains and enjoying the apparently magnificent view behind you?	1.159768973249138
I am more than happy for our House to be illuminated by the brilliance of our debates but a little real sunlight on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss.	0.9891323643844709
I think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the ushers.	1.120120897495526
Thank you very much Mr Onesta, I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort.	1.2518134128590237
I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being.	1.0219256603653544
In the meantime, I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter, technically speaking.	1.4715227894299991
If so, then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the President sits with his back to the light!	1.166671940602318
UCITS	-0.0
.	-0.0
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my hope that Parliament is prepared now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in Europe.	1.1357970060454348
As a new Member of the European Parliament, it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter.	1.4514301240559493
I should especially like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their willingness to find compromises; the President and the Bureau for lending a sensitive ear to this complex issue; the Commission, and especially the Commissioner, for being such worthwhile contacts; the Council; and also the division responsible for servicing the committee, for its selfless work.	1.449437313275291
There was a good deal of agreement within the committee, apart from on a matter which, too, I hope it will be possible to solve.	1.2271297348058336
The issue of UCITS may appear difficult, technical and a political minefield.	1.0031120552864166
I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stands for.	1.2471965026390197
Allow me, however, to state very clearly that this is a question which really does affect the citizens of Europe in so far as it relates to how their savings are administered, what options there are available, how competition operates between countries in regard to different forms of savings, savers' demand for security, and the opportunities Europe' s citizens have to save wisely for their old age.	1.3559207143349548
It is a question of weighing demands for liberalisation in the interests of a better market and higher yield against investors' need for protection and security.	1.0110989946212046
In the course of the 1980s, most markets in Europe underwent drastic deregulation. As a result, the national money and bond markets in particular developed very quickly over a period of a few years.	1.2655619650793875
Collective investment undertakings became an alternative to saving with a bank.	0.7811351166605179
In my own country, more than 60 per cent of Swedes save with a variety of funds.	0.9020561826354176
The security afforded by this type of saving is attributable to the broad range of investment vehicles in which the funds are placed.	1.0298567098070803
The capital and securities market has continued to be developed.	0.9477999683046865
The current Directive on UCITS has become antiquated and outdated.	0.8306437009816509
New types of funds have been introduced in the various Member States which are not permitted to market their units in other Member States.	1.0823626317500659
Obviously, this inhibits competition and innovation and restricts the public' s range of savings options.	1.0914784069223649
The Commission' s proposal with which we are dealing today is in two parts.	1.3613161112106948
The first concerns the product, that is to say the funds.	1.068455556590226
The other concerns the collective investment undertakings.	0.8536306690913651
The main purpose of the first proposal is to extend the investment opportunities of collective investment undertakings by allowing them to invest in units in other collective investment undertakings, for example units in funds, standardised options and futures contracts and deposits in credit institutions and in certain types of money market instruments.	1.1320176406550706
Special risk-spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments, involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria.	0.9683895453085654
In addition, the Commission' s proposal puts forward special risk-spreading rules for funds whose aim is to replicate a particular stock index, a so-called index fund.	1.126472697900092
The committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the Commission' s proposal more stringent.	1.3440196796297217
To guarantee transparency and prudence, investments in non-harmonised funds should only be allowed on condition that qualitative criteria, for example a transparency requirement and investor protection, are introduced.	1.0727373944146497
In addition, quantitative criteria (risk exposure) should be introduced.	1.0979382206918515
Moving on now, then, to the point where there is (or, I hope, was) a lack of agreement, namely OTC derivatives.	1.5580683767609065
The Commission' s proposal makes a distinction between derivatives dealt in on regulated markets and derivative instruments not dealt in on regulated markets (so-called OTC derivatives).	0.920151641282434
The Commission' s proposal takes it as read that OTC derivatives are not one of the general types of investment that UCITS deal in, but that they should only be used to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange-rate risks.	1.3179278570007205
In recent years, the derivatives market has grown very rapidly in almost all the Member States.	0.9665712759673288
It is therefore important that regulation of derivatives is flexible so that the market is not tied down ahead of future developments.	1.1213913160862226
The definitions 'standardised futures contracts' and 'standardised options' should therefore be combined to form a new definition, 'financial derivative instruments' , which also covers OTC derivatives.	1.1648471718522357
Investment in OTC derivatives, however, should only be allowed on condition that both quantitative and qualitative criteria are introduced.	1.0388530472038686
They are very important in this case.	1.1676264526695403
They must be introduced to guarantee the protection of investors.	1.020372561918303
The Commission' s second proposal focuses on the bodies which manage UCITS, that is to say management companies.	1.2133092232157168
The rules for management companies, for example the conditions for starting up and conducting business, are brought into line with the existing rules and regulations.	1.311059999741967
A crucial point is that rules are proposed for so-called simplified prospectuses.	0.9432647903590439
Relevant information must be given to prospective unit-holders in a fund in a language which is readily understandable to investors in the host country.	0.9431956094568263
In this regard, too, the committee is prepared to go further than the Commission.	1.1945516389058664
A question which has also been discussed in the committee is that of the capital contribution to be required from management companies.	1.4266774902642174
There are different views on this.	0.8546954811067501
One of the most important things, for me, personally, is that the common regulations should not cause smaller companies to go under.	1.3184578006755265
During the months that I have been working on this report, one very clear demand has emerged, both from industry and from those who represent the consumer.	1.2733605884031876
The current situation is not good.	1.0419947698626137
Both savers and the industry need modernised regulations for the whole of Europe.	0.8521245935573714
I believe that today' s proposal strikes a good balance between liberalisation of the market and the desire for effective protection for investors.	1.409370094121713
I just want to conclude by saying that a number of Members of Parliament think that the present proposal goes too far, while others think that I am not sufficiently liberal.	1.5257129651555354
To them I just want to say, as the English expression goes, 'You can' t have it all.'	1.2556978006702981
.	-0.0
Mr President, at the outset I wish to place on the official record of the House my thanks for the tremendous work undertaken by Mr Schmidt, our rapporteur.	1.4724863233171488
I was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous Parliament.	1.202627876098356
We failed over the last six years to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter.	1.0722801405265632
In a short space of time Mr Schmidt has managed to bring it forward to this final stage within Parliament. I thank him for that.	1.2726597137551656
As the draftsperson for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I also wish to place on record my thanks to the secretariat of both the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee for their cooperation on this matter.	1.0553595972325924
I am speaking today wearing a number of hats: firstly, as the surrogate father of this report; secondly, as the draftsperson of the opinion; and most importantly, as one who sees the tremendous advantages which can be gained for the European Union from a harmonised system of UCITS investment to ensure that monies presently being earned in Europe but invested outside the European Union and not put to the benefit of the Union economy can be retained within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship, employment and also for guaranteeing future pension rights.	1.4585295442283945
There is little disagreement amongst Members with regard to the first proposal.	1.0915687518615587
It puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities.	1.263580057341783
However, it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern.	1.7148097041597643
I have a number of ideas which should be put across.	1.2367913836631754
Firstly, the idea of an EU passport for management companies is to be welcomed; and the home-state approval rule is also to be welcomed.	1.4003763542037324
However, instead of imposing a new regime, we could have used the Investment Services Directive as the analogy for this regime.	1.3572741502749426
It seems unusual that we failed to grasp that opportunity.	0.7686552169431553
Many Members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries' national interests rather than improving the overall system for Europe.	1.1236981536061204
We will have to revisit this issue again in the near future.	0.8043770122990459
I call on Members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put Europe on a sound footing for the short term, if not for the long term.	1.3041984268420763
Mr President, I must firstly thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, my colleague, Mr Goebbels, and Mrs Villiers and Mrs Lulling from my Group. Despite their differing opinions on some points, they have consistently worked in an extremely constructive manner.	1.4913513675251067
As indicated by the rapporteur, we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this Parliament.	1.501890052115661
Collective investment undertakings have for some time been the primary savings vehicle through which millions of ordinary citizens, without any specialist knowledge, have invested their life savings.	1.1838482129776653
This is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation, albeit in a prudent manner.	1.2911955206851389
I say this because the failure of a bank is a problem for which any government can find a solution.	1.0314519293994233
However, the failure and suspension of payments of this type of undertaking would create a political, social and personal problem with incalculable consequences.	1.205964557439038
There is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings.	1.2174869494600264
I believe in a social market economy based on a successful market operating subject to certain rules intended to guarantee the general interest. Specifically, at the moment, this means the protection of investors.	1.3411595395142821
This basic principle of liberalisation, increased competition and greater investment opportunities, together with prudence to ensure the protection which investors deserve, has determined and inspired my Group' s position on most of the controversial points which have arisen.	1.239978036277781
Firstly, there is the problem of investment in non-harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive.	1.2072642431090685
It is clear that by extending the proposal under discussion, the options and the range of investments in undertakings for collective investments, those undertakings which remain outside the rules will be obliged to invest in high-risk funds.	1.1605210252404647
It would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments.	0.9899228974380232
Secondly, the problem of derivatives is one which has created the most divisions, both within my Group and between the groups.	1.4701735941034058
We have achieved a compromise solution.	0.9393244826455452
Everyone accepts that investments in derivatives must be legally limited in order to prevent a harmonised fund losing all its assets due to an investment in high-risk products.	1.1609976271064948
It is clear that this risk is greater when the investment is in derivatives not dealt in on a regulated market, namely the famous OTC derivatives.	1.1628538425583088
We have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this, or so we believe, which I welcome.	1.4484865570507597
As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage, I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament.	1.407666586041968
The texts before us today are old and were already old when they reached this House. This was because they were substantially amended during the Finnish Presidency.	1.23034405950238
We are therefore faced with two options. We can either return the proposals to the Commission for the latter to present a harmonised text or we can continue the current process.	1.4461048448068772
This second option has won the day and I am pleased about this. However, in the future I hope that the coordination between these two institutions and the Council can be improved so that our work is more understandable and more productive.	1.5468287971776558
Mr President, the Socialist Group supports the Commission' s efforts to implement the action plan for financial services.	1.291347186998735
Obviously, in the wake of the introduction of the euro, we need to create an integrated European financial market which is similar to the American and Japanese markets.	1.3187453633476505
The debates on UCITS gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee.	1.1512586386801438
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and also Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, for their constructive approach.	1.2644489585350813
The Socialists recognise the importance of the investment fund industry to the development of our economies and to the allocation of resources.	1.1867225994573551
But the world of international finance is a dangerous one.	1.1955734846068564
The capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses.	0.9388767530529054
There is at present a surfeit of cash looking for a home.	0.9777291618952552
In 1999, the increase in the means of payment in the world resulted in over-stimulated stock exchanges and an explosion in the volume of transactions, pushing up the prices of long-term financial and real assets.	1.1357146008235992
And as international financial activity speeds up, the risks increase.	1.1009846582947291
You do not need a Nobel prize in economics to realise that the current working hypothesis of the financial markets, which anticipate annual growth in profits of the order of 15 to 25% is quite simply unrealistic in the medium term.	1.1802566885363945
I adamantly believe that the main risk to the world economy in the foreseeable future is not inflation, but deflation generated as the speculative bubbles, created by what Alan Greenspan calls irrationally exuberant markets, burst.	1.2839174591011666
The legislature has a duty to contain the risk inherent in the continuing deregulation of the European financial markets.	1.067040167276253
By definition, investment funds use other people' s money.	0.9094211501796838
The legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses.	0.9131944058692762
There is no freedom without rules.	1.0897734981759395
We have done away with so-called master-feeder structures.	1.020748176590963
These feeder funds exist in the United States, which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system.	1.3330420047198157
The European market is still fragmented and such structures would doubtless cause problems.	0.8625468236846163
The Socialists, like the Commission, question the advisability of allowing investment funds to invest in so-called over-the-counter derivatives, i.e. products negotiated between professionals by private contract.	1.192853812764602
As these transactions are generally not subject to prudential control, the risks are all the more obvious.	1.1580068131266077
The Socialist Group has tabled amendments proposing both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clauses in order to contain the risks to investors.	1.0271657232158595
By adopting these amendments, Parliament will allow recourse to OTC derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors.	1.0662059153617003
Mr President, there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance.	1.3460431823747354
This principle should not only guide the public sector, it should also guide the private sector, especially financial undertakings.	1.356764977505665
Mr President, our objective in setting a framework for unit trusts and other UCTIS is to secure the highest possible safe return for our savers, which is why I want to address the issue of derivatives in my remarks today.	1.3244140459001674
I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure, safer, higher returns.	1.0015399000729066
Despite their image of danger, derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance.	0.7670324947365471
A contract that, for example, pays a substantial sum if, say, the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index falls, causes an extra payment by the investor if the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index rises.	0.9637144391839768
Is this speculative?	0.3456875339343949
Not at all.	0.3007153420889322
Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident: they have good management, good prospects and they are good investments.	1.2042734110228128
Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse, as it did in 1987.	1.2626609579518413
You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash, but that would be to waste your research into the winners.	1.269181114457521
It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall.	0.9369826352781632
The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls.	0.9189135780594128
But even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheaper, perhaps insuring you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index, you would still have the portfolio and the shares, but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse.	1.185147143365776
In exchange, you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets.	1.2017735243689704
In this case, which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers, you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk.	1.3000517571228125
That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund.	1.057993523769651
History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation.	0.8836115039829542
Heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers.	1.2192495575736864
Pension funds which suffered from rules on where they could and could not invest, as required by of our government bonds, made returns of 5.2% a year, barely half the 9.5% annual returns made by free funds between 1984 and 1996.	1.0931504246288577
These are of course the returns after deducting all losses.	1.0648934038053335
Do not confuse a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off.	1.1215207735225106
This is what we should be concerned about here today.	1.2753783015097344
Mr President, the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in Europe, including the most sophisticated forms of investment.	1.3308263902771442
We do not, in principle, oppose this industry.	1.0844059173932428
However, unlike Mr Christopher Huhne, we feel that a continent which has proved incapable of controlling its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may, in time, provoke the same type of crisis.	1.267123218703958
We shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group.	1.0572040518003365
But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole.	1.1506940795458502
We shall also vote in the future against any proposals to deregulate the financial markets and we call on all the other political groups to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income is finally harmonised.	1.199285435180954
For years certain countries, including Great Britain, have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens.	1.1492733133527138
They even reject the strict minimum, i.e. the Monti package proposed by the Commission in Brussels.	1.0974016689850183
This attitude is turning Europe into a machine which exempts investment income from tax and shifts the whole tax burden to commercial income, with all the social and even moral consequences which that implies.	1.0464430919562269
We must put an end to this.	0.7353396917329221
By blocking the demands of the financial industry, the European Parliament has the means to ensure that countries which have been turned into tax havens end up with their back against the wall.	1.2985188650524766
Mr President, the 1985 directive introduced a sort of European visa for certain types of UCITS which could be marketed throughout the Union.	0.9806254755039456
Since then, the capital market and transferable securities have not just continued to evolve; thanks to unbridled financial globalisation, they have exploded exponentially and without restraint.	1.130830294660512
This brings us to the two proposals for directives.	1.0220405424404582
The second proposal, on which the report is excellent, does not require any particular comment.	1.2076103376019123
It aims to strengthen consumer protection and security.	0.7858510220592689
It is a step in the right direction, even if one wonders why in heaven, with what right and with what respect for our citizens, we are further bolstering the monopoly of the English language in all documents distributed throughout Europe.	1.2733343075966324
That is the thrust of an amendment which we have tabled; it favours all the languages of the Community and our agreement to the second directive will depend on it.	1.4164131439932341
The same cannot be said of the first proposal.	0.7289953035208304
We might have been able to agree to the original text insofar as it was informed by a legitimate concern to update current legislation.	1.1613764717717634
However, we are unable to agree to the text of the report, although I welcome the work carried out by Mr Schmidt, for several reasons.	1.3998209176531191
First, it leans too far towards products based on indexes which have no bearing on the real economy; derivatives which will help to swell the financial bubble which Mr Lipietz referred to just now.	1.1569022370082773
Secondly, like him, I think that we should not promote excessive concentration in funds which, in the final analysis, will prove to be a Trojan horse for American pension funds.	1.5120695101476074
There is, of course, no reciprocity in favour of European UCITS.	1.2016296780588474
We shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the Member States to increase to 35% ...	1.1511890053087543
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
Mr President, this is a vital issue for Europe.	1.399754323303534
A Europe that faces an impending pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their savings.	1.0157761536299394
I welcome many of the developments which Mr Schmidt' s report brings us.	1.0242316992935698
UCITS are a success story within the European Union.	0.7986233334794232
They are a safe product, traded cross-border.	0.9143938862257359
But it is time for the legislation to be updated.	1.2200857579071882
Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here.	0.811563148632282
It is no secret that I would have much preferred Mr Schmidt' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through Parliament.	1.3697804965527762
But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach on this issue.	1.1668458297854982
The radical step taken by this report is to allow UCITS to use over-the-counter derivatives.	0.9637484028959692
I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS.	1.163736234865506
We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation. We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans.	1.2337030548285124
Mr Schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivatives.	0.9554562092315224
We must not be afraid to go forward, to react to changes in the market.	1.312628387908251
Yes, we need to continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumers.	1.2322477495741109
The report gives very adequate protection for consumers.	0.8059491602891099
But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives.	0.9379399941426387
I feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts, which can only help individual people around Europe obtain a high return on their savings.	1.1912115542358237
I salute Mr Schmidt.	0.43010390705813367
Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn.	0.9106720181606729
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an update for you on the curtain and window situation.	1.1442073989625703
If we open this curtain, then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away.	1.1587536835965169
We will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sitting. However, I will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies.	1.3990813089335383
Mr President, the UCITS directive has been an enormous success since it entered into force on 1 October 1989, mainly thanks to the excellent protection which it offers investors.	1.2427386399098095
The directive and the reputation which UCITS enjoy with investors have allowed the investment fund industry to multiply its assets in the European Union fivefold.	0.9728200890747843
There has been a strong increase in cross-border marketing of investments within the European Union and the directive itself is used as a model for legislation throughout the world.	1.2318464282587398
However, the directive is ten years old and, now that the markets have developed and more and more sophisticated financial products are available, it is somewhat outdated.	1.4238159779794364
The Commission proposals being debated here will give it the face-lift it needs.	1.0196379391293298
I share some of the concerns expressed here, especially by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, but this face-lift would be even more successful if the funds which simply reproduce a stock exchange index, and which are therefore managed either passively or not at all, and the funds which use an index as a benchmark for an actively-managed fund were treated in the same way, if only to allow medium-sized undertakings listed on the stock exchange but not included in the stock exchange index better access to the capital market.	1.296130024246998
In addition, investors often have better protection with an actively-managed fund.	1.0127851844216549
My Amendment No 47 is therefore a warning for amateurs.	1.0354924349532955
As far as the proposal for a new provision limiting investments in the same group to 15% is concerned, I would like to stress that, apart from the fact that this limit is too low, the text does not define the concept of a group. This concept does not exist under European law because it is impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice.	1.3464451719584454
I shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment.	1.14712785516119
To conclude, Mr President, allow me to remind the House that the directive needs a makeover which will make UCITS even more attractive, but it does not need to be strapped into a European corset which will squeeze the life out of it.	1.224740150429973
- (DE) Mr President, the introduction of the euro and the further liberalisation of capital markets has already produced a larger and deeper European financial area, which is helping to open up markets and create price transparency, but also to increase competition.	1.2232621433195008
At the same time, it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings, particularly those we are concerned with today.	1.3184013732210236
At the end of 1999 there were almost 15 000 investment funds registered as UCITS with a total value of in excess of EUR 2 billion, thereby accounting for roughly 75% of all funds assets.	1.1336828513093111
Hence the Commission rightly cited the economic importance thereof in its proposals for draft directives, and I must say that I actually have every confidence in the Commission' s proposal.	1.25195084093011
We are all aware how difficult it is to improve a legal framework for investment funds, and how difficult it is to construct the European passport for management companies around particular standards which are to apply even-handedly across the board.	1.2437714037163223
This therefore represents a step forward in respect of the legal and supervisory stipulations for financial markets and financial products.	1.2362098610233665
It is also my primary concern to optimise consumer protection in this way and I think it is very important for this to be reflected in the Commission' s proposal and that of the European Parliament, as well as in the compromise motions.	1.4285587034643392
However, I do not believe that we can assess the risk associated with the OTC derivatives, and I also think that as a European Parliament it is our duty to inform and impress again and again on consumers - who expect investment funds to be comparable with a traditional savings agreement when it comes to long-term security, and indeed that is why they were known as investment savings - that these products do not bear comparison and that is why we need a minimum level of protection.	1.5211851292407002
Why do we not take our cue from the minimum level of protection afforded by the trade in transferable securities directive, Article 11 for example, which relates to good practice?	1.2489046920125226
I therefore believe that this is another step forward we can take and I think it would also be a positive move if consumers and investors could be made aware of a fund' s name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile.	1.3173452273574306
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions.	1.1502547197736466
The preparatory work has largely consisted of a viable balance between increasing the efficacy and growth of the European investment markets and preserving a sufficient level of protection for consumers who buy fund units.	1.1082892119856442
The greater the trust consumers have in investment market operations, the more consumers will be prepared to invest on the open market.	1.139379004788504
And the more consumers invest, the brighter the prospects will be in the European business money markets.	1.446981245564088
It is quite clear that when businesses can more easily have access to their own capital-based finances their financial structure will be more firmly based, and, thus, opportunities for growth and investment will also improve.	1.1525388741229934
Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here.	1.0145502296100604
Although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment, the debate we had was not the easiest one.	1.2732086356941323
For me personally at least, difficulties were caused by the directive' s technical division into two different proposals, which certainly did not make it easier to familiarise oneself with this very difficult technical subject.	1.1198954274279362
However, I would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals.	1.314210037822562
Firstly, I am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments.	1.3924204420838384
As regards derivatives, I consider the position adopted by the committee justified - unlike Mrs Randzio-Plath, for example.	1.352222938427783
The directive should not treat over-the-counter derivatives differently from standard derivatives because they are used in many Member States and were also used before.	1.1081181610616608
With regard to Article 5g of the other proposal for a directive, the so-called Article on Delegation, I think the Commission' s original proposal on rules concerning authorisation was better than the one now approved in the committee, so I would support some of Mrs Villiers' amendments to this point.	1.4378686148724045
Mr President, I see two problems with this morning' s debate.	1.2047191215870623
Firstly, when I came to this Parliament many years ago I was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a Liberal.	1.4030776131290168
Now I have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the Luxembourg Members are in the Chamber at one time - and they are.	1.3649401794342342
Firstly, I welcome proposal No 1.	1.4938053040726826
It simplifies things and brings things up to date.	0.7796227989067687
I think many of the British Members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report.	1.2758787837723504
We support the Schmidt report on proposal No 1, but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks.	1.2635938312927781
We believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward.	1.2487541013899774
Secondly, we consider proposal No 2 to be very confused.	1.6168703039091228
It is difficult to understand, and we think the Commission would be well advised to look at it again.	1.345986326682611
If further regulation is needed, we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive.	1.2383653291587016
In particular, we disagree with the proposal on capital requirements because if they are put too high they could actually drive some businesses out of the industry altogether.	1.2078653143215559
We ask the Commission to look again at these proposals.	1.0220888136116284
Finally, we would urge Members to vote in particular against Amendment No 41 on capital requirements, because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry.	1.5127227296689938
Mr President, money does not smell, as the Romans would say.	1.4908033423923526
The important thing is for money to generate more money.	0.8763356254403356
This is the only opportunity that we have to see to it that the interests of economists converge with those of people who want to earn money and have their mind set on dollars, like Disney' s Scrooge McDuck, who has dollar signs for eyes, except in this case the symbol is that of the euro.	1.2968210414571795
In this we are combining the interests of these citizens with the interests of pensioners who want to live life in tranquillity.	1.1484180459846431
For example, my brother-in-law, who lives in Rome, started drawing his pension a year ago and every day since - from seven in the morning when he wakes until midnight - he has checked the TV screen to see how the pensions funds and the securities in which he has invested are performing.	1.3183402173195324
Pensioners will, in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal.	1.4290638735404855
Indeed, whilst the young are penniless, the elderly have accumulated money and, since they are keen to turn it to good advantage, harbour great hopes for this directive.	1.2986129391012278
If national governments had in their hearts - as the European Union has in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earned during the course of a working life, the pensions time bomb would already have been defused.	1.459105753928586
You too, in your role, Commissioner Bolkestein, have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and of pensioners, a future that I hope will improve once we have finalised this directive, by which I mean very soon, as has been proposed by Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi.	1.594502758120199
. (NL) Mr President, could I first of all express my heartfelt thanks to rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has principal authority, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Brian Crowley and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, whom I would like to thank for their thorough and important work on the refinement and extension of the proposals.	1.2944042612921618
Since the approval of Directive 85/611, the investment funds sector has undergone lengthy development and it is now important to modernise the rules.	1.2439193393386865
The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors, which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro.	1.323349290620126
Since the average European family puts its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and I would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk-spreading are concerned.	1.0891973119091274
The two proposals form a coherent whole.	0.9001066491949117
The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities' (UCITS) can invest.	1.0424099671562677
As already remarked in this session, UCITS are key players within the modern capital markets.	0.849228644074989
Their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets, in which the principle of risk-spreading is taken into consideration, protected by appropriate supervision.	1.1463038003423696
Since diverse types of investment are permitted, private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques.	0.929463243895795
The second proposal expands the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the EU capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector.	1.1324295156779276
By allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross-border basis, these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the Treaty of Rome, which they have been denied for all these years.	1.4062954904766247
The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas.	1.1336193060279744
The Commission will adopt Amendments Nos - and I am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 for the first proposal, and 23, 28 and 32 for the second proposal, since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements.	1.3099364767804207
I also value the ideas put forward in Amendments Nos 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20, although the wording needs to be adapted.	1.0211223598001797
I also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45.	0.8125242948132628
I can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of Amendment No 47.	1.201315484102805
All the amendments I have listed so far pertain to the first proposal.	0.9634167444753564
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the ideas of Amendments Nos 24, 25, 29, 30, 41 and some parts of 27, which contain sensible suggestions, can be adopted, again formulated appropriately.	1.141090092888624
The Commission has suggested adopting the content of these, with certain changes in the wording.	1.3667451117695948
Moreover, I have taken note of the request made by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to codify the entire text, once it has been approved - Amendment No 7 of the first proposal and Amendment No 22 of the second proposal.	1.3959988603740496
The Commission is in favour of codification and will, in the foreseeable future, once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative, concentrate its efforts on drafting a codified version.	1.2739511460036315
However, I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands.	1.3684250986994468
The Commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal.	1.3702723213929096
This is why the Commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal:	1.25154447147063
Amendment No 8 because the proposed, general reference to assets 'covered by this directive' , instead of the more precise reference to assets 'mentioned in Article 19 of this Directive' , hinders implementation.	1.1741443063407977
This Amendment could also lead to different interpretations in the Member States, which might well look for similar instruments in other articles of the directive.	1.0863116474000354
Amendment No 16 jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms.	0.8437571903816452
Neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions.	1.0641230735691156
We cannot, therefore, adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason.	1.0052954993606527
Amendment No 42 relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive.	1.155573652777903
I therefore cannot see any reason why Article 22, paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason.	1.047551035511994
Amendment No 44 cannot be accepted because, if it is prescribed that non-harmonised funds are subject to rules which have been 'imposed by the directive' concerning lending, borrowing, selling from an uncovered position and the third party custodian, this will indeed lead to a situation where very few funds, for example Swiss funds, would be eligible for investment.	1.299084656369495
This goes against the Commission' s intention to widen the scope of investments, and the wording thereof could contravene GATS agreements.	1.2429335794113565
Amendment No 47 is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first paragraph of Article 22a are concerned, because this proposal completely clashes with the spreading rules of Article 22, especially when the UCITS are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospectuses, as discussed in the Council.	1.3309656615551175
The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes.	1.1607258562715508
The Commission points out that, according to the national legislation of some Member States, the use of OTC derivatives for general investment purposes is already authorised.	1.081102397440917
However, the Commission will be suspending its position, given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments.	1.3002349405188627
I believe that OTC instruments could lead to problems, because they are not liquid, the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks.	1.3291051698638492
It seems inconsistent to opt for an extremely prudent approach with regard to investments as non-harmonised funds or deposits and, at the same time, freely to allow investments in clearly more risky OTC instruments.	0.9398972146367625
By rejecting the rapporteur' s Amendment No 39, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has aligned itself with the Council.	1.1194039688766273
The upshot of this amendment by Parliament would be that funds are allowed, in theory, to invest in OTC instruments and to trade the rights of participation in their funds across the entire internal market.	1.2397277410783232
In practice, access to other EU markets for these theoretically harmonised funds which invest in OTC instruments can be blocked by applying different national legislative frameworks and protective measures against OTC investments. This would contravene the fact that EU legislation applies to all funds which invest in OTC instruments.	1.0031002082754876
Given this possibly negative effect on the internal market and the risks inherent in OTC instruments, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 15, 37, 38, 39, 43, 46 and 48 and parts of Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45 which pertain to OTC instruments.	1.0100774531529242
As far as the second proposal is concerned, I already mentioned that the Commission will take into consideration many amendments.	1.3988338453763034
Despite this, there are some amendments which the Commission cannot adopt: Amendment No 26, which does not seem to observe the order in which licences are granted and activities start; parts of Amendment No 27, especially the part where the prevention of conflicts of interests is deleted, the delegation of tasks is restricted to components of management decisions and the general decision-taking of Member States concerning delegation is repealed; Amendment No 31 because the Commission is of the opinion that the application of Article 44 of the directive in unchanged form has proved adequate for the trading in rights of participation in UCITS.	1.2325649058484844
The application of the provisions of the directive concerning the performance of services in the field of investments in securities, better known as ISD, is therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulties or confusion.	1.2681548451610156
Amendment No 33 is ambiguous regarding 'the language' of the guest member state, especially when there are various official languages, and it is questionable what will be gained from translations in two other languages.	1.1555757294188096
Amendment No 34 is unacceptable because a simple deletion of the reference to pension funds can create ambiguity as to whether or not a management company can carry out these activities.	1.0344376707305598
I think that pension funds could also benefit from this possibility, provided that management companies are not lumped together with pension funds, but may only carry out part of the management per delegation.	1.3286571044355018
Amendment No 35 cannot be accepted because legally, it cannot command any authority.	1.152944742689288
Management companies which are denied access to a Member State would need to re-incorporate as a different legal entity in order to be permitted in another Member State.	1.1274296386406932
Amendments Nos 49, 50 and 51, which share the same basis, are not acceptable because they make substantial changes to the consistent approach of the Commission regarding the regulations of third party delegation, and do not offer sufficient security to the competent authorities and investors.	1.349608510423781
I would like to finish off by commenting on the remarks made by a few Members this morning and, Mr President, with your permission, I will do this in English.	1.4044399631082578
First of all, regarding the remarks of Mr Crowley, who asked whether the second proposal could not simply consist in taking over a pure ISD approach; the objections of the Commission to that proposal would be the following: such an approach would pose difficulties which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authorities and non-consistent sets of rules; moreover there would be no provisions whatsoever on conflicts of interest.	1.2234156387662178
For example, a management company might be doing underwriting business and, if not able to sell, it would put the securities in the fund it would manage, or else there might be difficulties in which order business should be executed if the management company did brokering business.	1.3383041305274257
Furthermore the proposal put forward by Mr Crowley would require a change of the ISD which at present - as I am sure he already knows - does not cover collective management business.	1.415358950611419
Lastly, his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render ISD activities.	1.2243235272225352
As regards the question put by Mr Huhne, his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations.	1.0618033770061652
But hedging operations are already allowed in the existing Article 21(1) of Directive 611/85 on UCITS.	1.0245622930258529
So what Mr Huhne wants is already possible.	0.7625909513419054
A question has been put by Mrs Villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management.	0.9993275780161448
That is also something which is allowed under present legislation. I refer to the same Article 21 I referred to in relation to Mr Huhne' s question.	1.3288985902995711
In her question Mrs Kauppi asks why the Commission has prepared a package of measures distributed in two separate proposals. The reason is that the first proposal focuses essentially on the product, while the second proposal focuses essentially on the service provider, and on prospectuses for UCITS.	1.4719870034686668
The separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of problems would facilitate the negotiating process in the Council.	1.0782302054182988
The Commission has not only to listen to Parliament and take into account parliamentary proposals but, as is well-known, must also deal with the Council.	1.5341046280597683
That is the reason why the Commission has put forward these two separate proposals.	1.245761245504255
Lastly, Mr Balfe has complained that there are, in his opinion, too many limits in the whole proposal the Commission has put forward.	1.592150039646016
It seems to us that these limits are justified: firstly, by the need to diversify investments; secondly, because of the vulnerability to the need to reimburse investment at any time; thirdly, in order to avoid an inordinate influence over the investment funds.	1.356636871819865
These are the reasons why the Commission believes, because of the prudence that has to be exercised in this field, that these various limits are necessary.	1.3884759311555879
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place at 12 noon.	0.8806295717638483
Mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States	0.23040450400597556
The next item is the report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union.	0.848847480653575
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in letters dated 3 August 1999 and 3 December 1999, the Council called on the European Parliament, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty, to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the Member States aimed at guaranteeing improved mutual assistance in criminal matters.	1.2869368355650919
It is thus, as you can see, a very important draft, that will effectively serve to provide the Member States of the Union with a more comprehensive and consistent instrument for mutual assistance.	1.604818390308137
In actual fact, there are still certain differences of opinion within the Council over the type of convention, and over certain provisions contained therein.	1.3587926332557871
Some of these differences have already been ironed out, but others persist.	1.4179082022860092
The spirit of the proposal is nevertheless to equip those responsible for applying the law - primarily the judiciary, but also the citizens concerned - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime, which respects fundamental guarantees as regards defence and general principles of human rights.	1.3423762643796784
It is for this reason that, despite the many omissions in the text, the provisions set out therein could - and I say could, Mr President - be accepted on condition that they are suitably amended in order to ensure they can be implemented by those responsible for applying the law and are acceptable to the citizens.	1.45018991726823
The Commission has proposed various amendments to this end, all of which aim to systematically restructure the Council proposal by suggesting a series of technical adjustments that will render the text harmonious and consistent as regards the amendments proposed.	1.1660956502504543
The amendments can be summarised as follows: they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence, introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible, and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications, an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various Member States of the Union.	1.1882918827275375
The proposal, as formulated by the Council and subsequently amended by the Commission, provides for a convention based on three titles: the first lays down guidelines for ensuring the consistency of procedures and formalities for letters rogatory; the second lists a whole series of specific requests for mutual assistance and defines the formalities and procedures which must be followed in relation to these specific types of mutual assistance; the third and last provides for and codifies the procedures via which telephone conversations conducted by citizens in a State other than the one instigating proceedings can and must be intercepted.	1.2271532066336344
Mr President, international cooperation is certainly needed in order to tackle both cross-border crime and crimes which are committed in one State, but the evidence for which is to be found in another.	1.453783112939909
It is nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other, even more delicate issues into account: the whole issue of double jeopardy, that of specialities, and that of the credibility of one Member State of the Union in respect of the judicial authorities of other Member States of the Union.	1.5219478988960378
These are thus extremely important questions, which we hope that the Council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion.	1.3834031129703146
As regards other aspects of this subject, Mr President, I would refer you to my written report.	1.1779142177052417
- (ES) Mr President, I want to start by saying that I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party which I represent on this issue.	0.9965004533760116
I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Council is not present today.	1.3607903272586273
By contrast, I welcome the attentive presence of Commissioner Vitorino, as has consistently been the case since his appointment. This leads me to another point.	1.3574154370289937
This House has only prepared one report on this Convention. It was in fact consulted on a text which was not the text being worked on by the Council and which did not contain points which had already been agreed.	1.3487989970701846
I condemn this, as well as the Council' s absence.	1.4072749184316073
These are serious matters on which this House must act.	1.0672836058935442
We are about to advance into new territory where attitudes and symbols are of great significance.	0.7334298565302771
A political community is reflected in the justice which it hands out.	0.8959817846470982
This is why this report is so important.	1.251268471535852
It represents a step towards the area of freedom, security and, particularly, justice to which we all aspire.	1.3446481201872635
It is also an important step towards European natural justice. This will be built on mutual confidence between the Member States and their respective legal systems and on the confidence of the European people in any European court.	1.4467814860046069
It will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular.	1.1010232650936866
It is in this respect that this House has significantly - and in my opinion rightly - altered the balance proposed by the Council by firmly and decidedly supporting a reinforcement of these guarantees of fair trials in all the amendments.	1.5456341094958603
Mr President, as the rapporteur said, this House has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the Convention.	1.4017672378340889
On behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have tabled an amendment to the motion for a resolution which asks the Council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible.	1.0408462960522196
The regulation of phone tapping in the Council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate.	1.0608978790208612
Yet a lack of regulation is also inappropriate and may lead to abuses in the telecommunications field. In fact, we are aware that these are already happening widely.	1.2730603186329639
The other point which I must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video conferencing with regard to accused persons.	1.1759651996767635
Again on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have asked the Council to produce a convention as soon as possible in order to clarify and supplement the regulation of this issue, which is frankly unsatisfactory.	1.32085519787198
Apart from a few exceptions, the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party will vote in favour of the committee' s amendments, and of course our own.	1.3064687218136894
Mr President, it is our opinion that one facet of the construction of Europe hinges on the construction of a common judicial system, for the Europe that we want to build, which comprises administrative law, civil law, both substantive and procedural, and criminal law, both substantive and procedural.	1.538724080601026
The Convention on Mutual Assistance and Criminal Matters, which we are examining today, is but a stitch in the great fabric of the corpus iuris of Europe, which has its natural foundation in fundamental human rights and freedoms.	1.3242883983355953
Thus it is that legal cooperation and cooperation on criminal matters must also strictly respect fundamental rights, principles which lie at very root of our culture and our civilisation: I am thinking of fair trials, and more particularly of the rights of the defence, of the impartiality and integrity of judges, of the length of legal proceedings, for which my country, Italy, unfortunately has the worst record in terms of the number of sentences handed down, of the cases pending before the European Court of Human Rights.	1.3605405911839936
Restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law.	1.1229196704427276
The report that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has substantially amended with regard to its original formula, taking up many of the amendments we have presented, still leaves room for a certain confusion, in relation to the way in which the interception of telecommunications and video conferences are to be regulated.	1.3467802328500937
The news received in recent weeks on the way in which modern technologies facilitate interceptions mean that greater attention must be paid to this issue: we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and troubled than the dark scenes depicted by Orwell.	1.1253383220024837
This is only the beginning of a great project in the field of law, which should advance hand in hand with the growth the type of Europe we want to see.	1.3794821847157874
Mr President, committee amendments and political group amendments may be tabled in plenary, but not amendments from individual Members.	1.3530472463047511
Mr Schulz should be aware of this.	0.6918550887034
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully understand the frustration of Mr Di Pietro who, in a short space of time, has had to carry out an extraordinary amount of work in order to be able to submit this report to us today.	1.2852055196205254
Crime in the European Union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step-by-step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs.	1.2674429729260788
The European Parliament is certainly not to blame for this.	1.3239709251792875
It is the governments of the Member States who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree.	1.1939542837871626
As a result, the European Parliament is faced with an almost impossible task.	1.2568774889749168
One has to content oneself with the idea that all means, however slight, must be seized upon in order to set up better legal assistance.	1.3118241613009904
By way of paradox, I could say that it would be best if as little as possible was said about this report, for the clearer we make it that only very small steps are being taken, the more the world of crime will gloat and the more the acute imbalance between organised crime and the desperate lack of judicial cooperation will become obvious.	1.3881428683528902
I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council of Ministers to finally face reality, that is to say the fact that crime is developing faster than the law.	1.3802741353425394
The goal is, after all, to provide the judicial bodies - magistrates, in the first place, but also the citizens involved - with the instruments to fight crime without prejudice to the fundamental guarantees of defence and the general principles of human rights.	1.3350725937694514
If not, we will be fighting a running battle.	1.1395148186143984
I therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the EU Member States in the first instance.	1.1875133292686315
In my opinion, this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States.	1.1791749873624693
As long as this harmonisation has not been achieved, however, we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance.	1.269117810953007
To this end, I had submitted an amendment stipulating that legal assistance can only be granted in the event of criminal prosecution instituted by the authorities based on facts which are punishable according to the national law of the petitioning party and the Member State petitioned.	1.341710091907707
The content of my amendment is, in fact, echoed in Amendment No 43, which also stipulates this condition of accrual.	1.261103936193531
This condition of accrual is essential since, in my opinion, the principle of nulla poena sine lege, legality in criminal law, must be observed.	1.0648826049905646
As such, any request for legal assistance concerning a hypothetical action which is not a crime in the petitioned Member State contravenes this principle of legality and thus the fundamental principles of justice in the petitioned Member State.	1.2042422373135764
Hence, it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted.	1.395151993965594
Finally, I would like to reiterate that Mr Di Pietro has, in my opinion, delivered sterling work by submitting a report which, within the limitations, offers all possible guarantees for safeguarding individual human rights and fundamental freedoms.	1.13107268162685
If, however, we would like to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation.	1.3113717690394637
Mr President, my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs.	1.2770797848750508
The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government.	1.0309776716943404
The present proposal is complex, because it deals with agreements between Member States but has far-reaching consequences for the citizen-government relationship.	1.213249795542967
It is precisely in the field of legal protection that the Council' s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired.	1.2598725711109442
In the words of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro, the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings.	1.1372115275882901
Thanks to the agreement, it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests, whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different Member States.	1.229913641392401
The chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court.	1.190737525672053
Additional measures are hence required, such as the obligation on the part of criminal investigators to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used.	1.047668109645246
The fact that the Council' s proposal rides roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my Group.	1.2531356176747426
There are certainly no restrictions in its scope.	0.7670934026371169
As such, the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime.	1.3124976369199053
In fact, it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law.	1.2790962674981528
It is, therefore, conceivable that the European Union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will vanish in the dust.	1.2400092040301325
Mr President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters that we are examining today contains the minimum requirements for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies concerned.	1.0738060550740898
It pertains, among other things, to notifications, information exchanges, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of property, testimonies via video conferences, investigative activities and 'undercover' activities, and the interception of telephone calls.	1.1858389330054284
This is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached, and it should immediately be said that if any amendments, such as Amendments Nos 32 or 81, or the revised Amendments Nos 70 or 71, were to be passed, the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped, and we would vote against it.	1.4514547679562775
I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments.	1.259074996672233
The fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this Parliament.	1.3097540320422603
As Commissioner Vitorino will have noted in all the various speeches, the need has emerged to draw up a framework of common rules, which is to say that we cannot continue in this manner, with this disparate agenda, with these piecemeal agreements which relate to diverse sectors such as that of investigation.	1.4941123310970705
What is, on the other hand, absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the Community, and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible, and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement.	1.3759424655208872
My thoughts turn to what may become of this Community, of these conventions and judicial relations if, for example, a fascist country such as Turkey became a member of the Union. It would truly perplex me.	1.518734491607745
We need a corpus iuris - as everyone has said - and common rules, especially procedural ones, which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the Community.	1.5240357332907415
It is clear that this is primarily an issue for the IGC and one that addresses an aspiration to which this Parliament can only make a limited contribution in as much as everything depends on the Council and the Commission.	1.2825954662349721
I believe that this first half of the year, in which we have a Commissioner from Portugal and Portuguese Presidency of the Council, provides an excellent opportunity to give an initial spur to this shared aspiration.	1.3855313425816111
It is precisely for this reason that we are in favour of adopting Amendments Nos 78 and 79, which already prefigure a minimum of set rules on interceptions and on video conferences.	1.2432107777013144
On the one hand, we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote, precisely so that this convention - which, I repeat, already sets minimum rules - is not stripped of all meaning, while on the other hand we are also looking forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the Commission with a view to definitively putting into effect this minimum Community law.	1.362141368029803
Mr President, confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level, the Member States must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible.	1.2749852381421267
Indeed, they must set in place the institutional conditions needed to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law - a process that must nevertheless cover all the stages needed to prevent the untimely impositions that are detrimental to legitimate national prescriptions in the field of justice, over which Member States have sovereign powers, and above all to prevent impositions that result in riding roughshod over basic civil rights.	1.2830308537326731
We must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the Council which, as the rapporteur himself has underlined, now claims, after years of discussion, to have found a universal solution in the space of a few months.	1.493479072877539
Furthermore - and I agree with the assessment made by Mr Di Pietro - the Council' s text would appear to be overladen with contradictions, inconsistent propositions and omissions.	1.2613016878844399
It is clear that the justice sector, more than any other, cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner.	1.226629407332068
It is the opinion of our Group that even the report, considered as a whole, would be the subject of much debate, notwithstanding the incorporation of certain corrective amendments that take into account the safeguarding of personal liberty and respect for national sovereignties.	1.2898888791745455
The report contains arguments that are too disparate, which do not link together smoothly, and everything thus hinges on approximations.	1.2326600522080182
We will, in conclusion, vote against this report, while stressing that the Europe to which we aspire is a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that call for gradual and responsible discussion, as well as very serious examination.	1.2445748190958819
We must first establish general rules and institutional certainties. Only then will we be able to institute actual conventions.	0.9657523339059156
Mr President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament on the Bonino List, I intend to confirm the position that we adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties and am thus also announcing our vote on their behalf. It is a vote against this report, or more precisely a vote against the convention on which the report is based.	1.3845414696787874
I would nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work. He listened very closely to our arguments at the committee stage, and particularly those on the issue of respecting the rights of the defence, both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of European mutual assistance.	1.2809949351783942
The committee and the rapporteur have incorporated nine of the eleven amendments that we presented, and these centred precisely on the rights of the defence.	1.2591525411935656
This spurs us to maintain that the European Parliament would have done sterling work in guaranteeing that civil rights and freedoms were safeguarded, if this were a lawmaking parliament and if we were, as part of this procedure, in fact co-legislators - which we are not.	1.5699940441840206
This is the problem, and it is for this reason that we are critical of the position adopted by the Council, which is one we find completely unsatisfactory.	1.3984863865403345
This is a task that has lasted three years, and on which we have been consulted, so to speak, as a matter of course, when this issue, as has already been stressed, comprises highly important formal and substantive facets, which called for a range of assessments, consultations, concerted actions and codecisions.	1.3771536081777092
It would seem to us that the Council has taken the various issues - those of legitimate interceptions, the rights of the defence, the rights of detainees and of the authorities legally empowered to request mutual assistance - a little too lightly.	1.4035175543651648
We should have requested and rejected the first version of the convention, and then requested another: the majority on the committee did not want this and it is for this reason that we will vote against it, even if we hope that the amendments, which nevertheless improve the text, can be incorporated by the Council - we doubt that they will be, but hope all the same that they are.	1.5964888991551816
In my Group, there are undoubtedly different views of Mr Di Pietro' s report.	1.1337965017034035
I agree that it is - as has been said - a good and competent piece of work, which has been carried out under difficult conditions.	1.3739507386021055
The Danish Members of the Group cannot vote in favour of the proposal but will, on the contrary, be supporting a number of amendments, especially those tabled by the Greens.	1.5078095085416332
There are two reasons why we are saying no.	1.2487482003816537
Firstly, these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and, to my mind, the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty, which have not been fully realised. This is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support.	1.4498938928172094
The other main reason, however, is that, even though we are concerned here with a Convention (and therefore with international cooperation), there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal. And the trend is towards creating, in the longer term, a common European area of jurisdiction, common EU criminal law and common EU administration of justice.	1.542407654376939
We would warn against that trend. We have this AFSJ mantra - Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - the full enormity of which lies in its establishment of EU systems which will play havoc with existing legal traditions relating to these sensitive and important questions which are overwhelmingly national in character.	1.2081358770597987
Mr President, I too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom, security and justice which Europe will hopefully one day become.	1.4413772619519443
It is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons, in which there are no frontiers to crime, but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime.	1.4128852010280721
A small step - I say - but nonetheless a welcome one, for which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has quite correctly wanted to prescribe further restrictions and guarantees in the name of the defence of the fundamental rights of the individual that are in force in the Member States and in the Union itself, even if these are not yet enshrined in a European Union charter of rights, which we hope will soon come into being: just restrictions and guarantees because, unfortunately, existing rights are, in practice, not always respected by every public authority in every Member State.	1.3690728106798191
Certain isolated passages in the Commission' s proposal perhaps err on the side of caution, as is the case when it is maintained that the detainee accused should be given the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of preliminary enquiries.	1.2608973440282472
I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation.	1.2938409535475357
Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link.	1.2820808282905285
These are nevertheless minor flaws, which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote.	1.5403536517304373
The rapporteur has made laudable efforts, which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him.	1.5247803623596246
The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account.	1.131613626320715
There is, as has already been said, one point still to resolved, which is also the most delicate one: it concerns article 18 of the convention, which relates to the interception of communications originating in one Member State, but which are directly performed by another Member State, without the assistance being requested of the State in which the interception is being carried out, something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology.	1.395161848321226
This is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse.	1.1150058208672766
It could be maintained that in overall terms the legislation proposed is better than nothing, but to the Commission it nevertheless appeared insufficient and far from reassuring.	1.2759944316342986
It thus merits further reflection which, at a time in which the ambivalent reports on ECHELON are evoking shades of Big Brother, should probably go into greater detail on the means and methods to be used, on the one hand, to safeguard the rights of the individual, and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime.	1.317280451204935
The objective is thus to achieve, as closely as possible, a fine balance between the fight against organised crime and respect for personal freedoms and the dignity of the individual: an objective which now specifically applies not only to the Member States, but also to the Union, which is aspiring to become a common area of freedom, justice and security.	1.3592409449730818
This is a distant goal, but is one that can be attained in stages.	1.3754717131672345
The most important thing will be the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States, but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward, as it is a step in the right direction.	1.278048792099935
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement.	0.9886928696008598
It points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal.	0.9390146198223572
The lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty.	0.9584723779593852
Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters.	1.1721704542735705
Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely, and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights.	1.0951239407066615
Article 18 allows interception in another Member State without its involvement.	0.8033019344085552
Not only should this be deleted, the whole interception title should be scrapped.	1.2114387913444822
An initiative of the FBI drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation.	1.0853744069658056
The Council proposal containing those requirements, ENFOPOL 98 was approved by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report.	1.0020998180798601
Now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception, and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at.	1.4208339905054637
The requirements propose to allow the authorities access to the facilities of all service providers, that is, telephones, mobile phones, Internet, etc.; and given the current extremely shoddy drafting, this is open to abuse. I would also like to ask: given that the user requirements specify that the police has access to all service providers without exception, does this include Parliament' s in-house service?	1.2804710517139948
Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very, very shoddy grounds?	1.1504404873797092
Furthermore, in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences.	1.774510415105313
This leaves it wide open to abuse.	0.5251837024776949
Again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof, something which is recognised in international, fundamental law, the presumption of innocence is essential.	1.106506425287329
That is not guaranteed.	1.073296610881466
Neither the preamble nor the body of the text takes proper account of the rights of the defence, a basic principle of international fundamental rights.	1.1032113787055955
This issue is extremely serious.	0.7266756735217469
We are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout Europe which are extremely concerned about these developments.	1.1559791341743395
Mr President, I am neither a member of the Legal Affairs Committee nor a lawyer, but like almost all of us, I understand the need for this Single Economic Area of Europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom, security and justice.	1.4129255970218808
In that sense, the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important.	1.1378272894218409
What did I understand on reading the related texts?	0.7953973163831335
That it is dangerous to rely on the provisions made by the Council.	1.047805982530506
The many contradictions and conflicting views over what Europe is and the many different legal systems could not only lead to confusion and inefficiency but also create dangerous situations.	1.0005959353377074
For example, the situation proposed by Article 18, to which many speakers have drawn attention, where each country, each large country if you will, each country with the technical ability, can enter another country and monitor its telecommunications without even securing the second country' s approval.	1.4211412072729972
In my opinion, the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur Mr Di Pietro have produced some very interesting work.	1.075005235307034
It is a pity that this very well constructed explanatory statement by Mr Di Pietro could not be conveyed in the telegrammatic five minutes he had here today.	1.1266115417222131
Nevertheless, it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries, defendants and citizens, a path which I think must be pursued much more completely and much more boldly.	1.3346791946495116
I should like, however, to draw your attention to the fact that all this is taking place in a framework in which there is confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law.	1.2565983853968243
A child, a student or a pupil who smokes hashish in one country is dealt with in an educational way, while in another country he is treated as a criminal and locked up in the universities of crime constituted by the corrective system and the prisons.	1.117678608762997
How can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis?	0.9641338394402954
For that reason, in conclusion, I believe we should do something, particularly in the area of harmonisation of laws, not those relating to organised criminal activity, but those concerning punishable activities by the people which are more in the nature of social phenomena.	1.4433484405820736
On behalf of the TDI Group, I should like to take the opportunity afforded by Judge Di Pietro' s report on mutual assistance in criminal matters to refer to a case which is a tragic illustration of the way crime is eroding security in Europe.	1.2971516902728062
On 14 December 1999, a five year-old boy called Clément was found in a sleeping-car on the Calais-Ventimiglia train, crying for his mother who was taking him to visit his sick grandmother.	0.9951481143459432
Corinne Caillaux, who had probably been raped, was found with her throat cut and covered in stab wounds in the lavatories on the train.	1.1087549718560943
The presumed killer, Sid Ahmed Rezala, is also strongly suspected of having murdered the British student Isabel Peake, who was raped and thrown out of the train taking her to see her parents, and another young woman, Émilie Bazin, who was found dead in Amiens under a pile of coal in the building where he lived.	1.1263026336173525
Rezala should never have been in France. He arrived from Algeria at a time when, according to the authorities, immigration had been stopped and there was no reason for him to come.	1.1820733029616939
He should never have stayed in France, having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences, which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country.	1.1844310466207522
He should never have been free because 14 charges of theft, violence and rape had been brought against him, one of which was for the rape of a minor.	1.016477613552208
He should never have been able to escape from France, but the officers pursuing him had no jurisdiction and European frontiers have more holes than a sieve.	1.1123738400818504
He should never have arrived in Spain, where he mugged a woman at knifepoint and yet was immediately released by the Spanish authorities.	1.0202206953559987
Today, thanks to the complex networks of sexual deviants, he is in Portugal.	1.043728708010485
Portugal refuses to extradite him on the grounds that he would face a longer prison sentence in France than that provided for in the Portuguese penal code.	1.1527982384852693
I should like to ask the Portuguese minister, the President-in-Office of the Council, to put a stop to this scandal at once.	1.1606629361432028
I should like to ask the House to wake up, at long last, to the appalling situation of the victims of policies for which the establishment, not the yobs, bears full responsibility.	1.3455988305179571
Mr President, this agreement deals with a sensitive issue: cooperation in the field of criminal law.	1.1301796849355707
It is therefore understandable that the Council finds it difficult to agree.	1.2841748361269387
Successful application of this agreement by the Member States requires unanimity within the Council.	1.1678687664569267
Only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice.	0.7157894320853764
This, however, does not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously.	1.4437613659204012
Quite the reverse, in fact.	0.891559791985225
The Council' s proposal must comply with legislation of the national Member States in the field of criminal law.	1.101116797510974
The wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test.	0.9095027758320201
Careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but, above all, by the national parliaments, is therefore of key importance.	1.4630677155047702
Mr Di Pietro' s proposal to omit the current Article 18 regarding intercepting telecommunications, amongst other things, is understandable, although very strict.	1.1721688905059042
The text of Article 18 is ambiguous: he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a Member State in another Member State without the latter' s prior authorisation.	1.1481200128172975
In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State.	1.188616112199209
Proposed additions, such as repeated references to the ECHR, the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of Member States to implement the ECHR, add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement.	1.1992199844941196
I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text.	1.2706542604353033
The Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will, however, despite hesitation, not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote.	1.4102401532470141
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation.	1.200215087398809
This clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much-discussed European citizenship.	0.8727060944273364
On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting.	1.3418343116419875
Pursuant to Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union' s objective is 'to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia' .	1.2378900195227518
The creation of Europol represents one step towards achieving this objective. However, we must take the next step, which is to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to gradually establish a genuine European judicial area consistent with the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	1.1194450324490428
This draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application, at Member State level, of pre-existing conventions on other legal areas. The intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the Member States and in the European Convention on Human Rights.	1.235259734238971
It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue.	1.268947155848916
As for videoconferencing, more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded.	1.170995870246447
The procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights...	1.0491039617221964
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
Mr President, legislating in criminal matters is often countered, wrongly, with arguments of individual freedom and security.	1.288053053750276
Is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed?	0.8038533162937487
Is one free when security is no longer assured?	0.9011466879898498
Modern criminal law revolves around the quest for a balance, a dialogue between security and freedom.	1.0123273538994784
And this dialogue is open-ended; it adapts to the demands of the day.	1.127466898249863
Nowadays, certain forms of crime are cross-border crimes and it is, of course, in the interests of the Member States to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them.	1.2361999671490307
But the Council' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts.	1.126324749687294
First, the form: the draft convention is vague in the extreme, and this is totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society.	1.355374956457622
It is not just a question of style.	0.869794881733802
We are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter.	1.1060016370628982
Then the content: the Council draft fudges the obvious difficulty caused by widely differing legal systems, varying practices and a total lack of legal public service standards in certain Member States of the Union.	1.067633562797736
It makes provision in article 9 for prisoners held in custody to be transferred from one state to another despite the fact that guarantees differ.	1.0612276706425636
I should like to stress this point because it is paramount.	1.2845223252798106
We must not forget that several tens of thousands of people are currently held in custody in the European Union without having stood trial and that, in some states, custody is abused and used as a means of extorting confessions.	1.2551304567813029
It is nothing less than legal torture.	0.5730747245673508
Other European countries, on the other hand, do not accept confession as sufficient proof of guilt.	1.0832118176787966
It is this diversity in our criminal policies which we have to address and legislating properly means looking for genuine legal convergence criteria and facing up to the reality of prisons in Europe, which are often overcrowded places outside the law which are a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves.	1.2510086768827808
Mr President, as you know, all of our countries abolished the death penalty years ago, but with nearly a thousand suicides a year in our prisons, they have not really abolished it?	1.453385107448936
Mr President, co-operation in the field of law is without doubt essential in free market Europe, but it must hinge on the strictest respect for those principles which lie at the very heart of our civilisation: the fundamental human rights and freedoms, laid down in the European Convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.	1.2798737369164757
We can but thank the parliamentary committees, which have - via the introduction of numerous amendments - made far-reaching modifications aimed at providing guarantees to a report which, in its initial format, we did not find at all convincing.	1.3453183720836657
I turn to Mr Schulz in confirming that we always submit amendments not on a personal basis or for personal motives, but in connection with general political concerns.	1.2762794455496849
If it is then a question of listing the areas investigated or researching these, they can be found with the rapporteurs, among them the author of the report on this convention.	1.2962639684923873
I thus believe that Mr Schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks.	0.890052048642292
As I have said, numerous amendments have been incorporated which guarantee the rights of the defence - I am thinking here of the obligation for interceptions to be requested by a judge - or the prohibition on holding both an investigative and a judicial mandate as part of a joint investigation team.	1.3240463451753006
In brief, this Parliament wanted the convention to apply solely to criminal matters; the restrictions on freedom and on fundamental rights set out in the convention can but be limited to criminal matters.	1.1903779147416333
We need hard and fast rules.	0.4249682349198501
The Council has behaved in an unseemly manner, changing tack in mid-course, and is nowhere to be seen.	1.3388625652797705
We would, on the other hand, like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for attending the debate held in this Chamber.	1.340350822542043
As I have said, we need hard and fast rules if we are to have fair trials in Europe - without intrusion from interceptions, without the illicit use of video conferences - because we in Europe should no longer have trials run by magistrates who play politics rather than administer justice, and because punishment should be meted out to the real perpetrators of crime and not to innocent people who someone finds inconvenient.	1.295281183962107
. Mr President, the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is approaching adoption by the Council.	1.081539672085052
Most say it is about time.	1.1087630476350785
According to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the Council in April 1997, the work on the draft MLA Convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997.	1.4710542364228854
More time will pass before the Convention actually enters into force, given the fact that this requires Member States' ratification.	1.2714109979175297
Even with the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, foreseeing its entry into force once at least half of the Member States have adopted the Convention, I would like to urge the Member States to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this Convention.	1.2965982444608293
Past experience with ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing.	0.9584743824196164
This Convention will not create a new or different system of Mutual Assistance.	1.0024870721622945
Instead it aims at building on tried and tested mechanisms that have been in place for a very long time, such as the ones foreseen by the Council of Europe Convention on mutual assistance of 1959 and the Benelux Treaty.	1.1818335317765998
The draft that the Council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several Members of Parliament.	1.2467428343184317
It is a considerable achievement of the Convention that where at all possible requested Member States shall comply with the formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting Member States.	1.2178729981983258
This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court.	1.088090873568686
Furthermore, requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities.	1.1898958165707474
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of provisions: those that create an obligation to render assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences, controlled deliveries and on the interception of telecommunications; and those where no such obligation is created and only a legal framework is provided for Member States that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribed, for example, the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert investigations and the sending and service of procedural documents.	1.1515836533952266
The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime.	1.081529807744227
It is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations.	1.02368109331242
However, one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence.	1.6790197973361252
I very much appreciate that the report of Mr Di Pietro, whom I salute for the excellent work he has done in such a short period of time, includes the right of defence as one of its main points.	1.3434955900459298
At the present time it is entirely up to the Member States to ensure that those rights are respected under the scrutiny of the Council of Europe' s Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.	1.4072405732373736
It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights, work on which has just begun.	1.1557555719756119
We must recognise that Article 18 concerns what is clearly a controversial decision.	1.0207459292181518
The article was carefully crafted in Council in very lengthy discussions, in order to ensure that intelligence activities would remain effective and that criminal investigations will be covered.	1.0211199217055826
As far as criminal investigations are concerned, for which I am responsible, I take note of the invitation that was addressed to the Commission and the Council by several Members of the European Parliament to take this issue on board and to address it on a common legal basis, having regard to the relevance the interception of telecommunications may have as evidence before the courts.	1.3865693439849889
The Commission is fully aware of the fact that the draft we have before us is not perfect or ideal.	1.336376239778288
However, we must be realistic.	1.4343914303933807
The text we have is the result of the mixture of the institutional set-ups foreseen for judicial cooperation in criminal matters under both the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties respectively.	1.016749775574087
This is what we have, and only practical experience will show us in detail if and where there are shortcomings and what additional steps will have to be taken.	1.3615730221685791
I am quite aware of the fact that the further development of mutual trust and mutual confidence among the judicial systems of the Member States will ease the road we have ahead of us.	1.183386871933638
Apart from that, the Tampere European Council has already indicated in which direction we, in the Commission, should go.	1.5448895272839667
Among the steps to be taken will be the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the setting-up of the Euro Just project.	1.3010912976691824
The Commission sincerely hopes that the European Parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields.	1.2721029225913731
I do not expect you to wave through or rubber stamp everything you are confronted with in the coming years.	1.0768388204754393
I am counting more on the European Parliament to be not only a critical observer, as it has been in this case, but also an active player in taking the Union forward in the fight against crime.	1.4525689908284352

II. the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) with a view to regulating management companies and simplified prospectuses (COM(1998) 451 - C4-0465/1998 - 1998/0242(COD))	0.9833278979061223
Goebbels (PSE).	0.6278385542080048
(FR) Madam President, when a Swede, a Spaniard, a Luxembourgeois and a German have to negotiate in English, linguistic ambiguities will arise.	1.319549135703702
I therefore propose, in agreement with the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, that the words 'issued by' be replaced with 'dealt with' throughout Amendment No 37.	1.270456417496953
The words 'issued by' also need to be added after the words 'transferable securities' .	1.1040437502722558
The amended text will then read, and again I must read it in English, which is the lingua franca of our Parliament: 'transferable securities issued by over the counter derivatives dealt with' , etc.	1.1595747659874511
We must also ensure that Amendment No 45 by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil is amended if it is to be adopted, because the same problem will arise.	1.243240226537161
Mr Goebbels, I am sorry, but I think you are jumping the gun; Amendment No 37 is an oral amendment proposing that the words 'with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale' be moved. You were asking for the place to be changed.	1.2583532338855394
Madam President, my apologies, I was looking at Amendment No 36, which logically precedes Amendment No 37.	1.5673367059475882
But, you are right, we are discussing Amendment No 37 and here too we have a similar problem.	1.5546446787383672
It is not the establishments but the instruments which should have a high rating.	1.430353888222459
The text therefore reads: 'instruments with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation' .	0.7562036532765554
My apologies once again for my mistake.	0.7918439552645997
Are there any objections to this oral amendment?	0.7658220186130916

(Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions in two separate votes)	1.0950890706576328
Madam President, I asked for the floor before the sitting started in order to say something solely intended for you as President of this House. We have a procedure for visits to be made to this House to report on certain situations.	1.5178472980858555
I do respect and agree with this procedure, as I also agree with the freedom of expression for everyone. However, for the second time in a fortnight these visits have been used to attack individuals, political parties, including my own, and institutions.	1.467384731638268
I feel that this behaviour, particularly in your presence, is unacceptable and totally repugnant, especially when we are on the point of an electoral campaign.	1.3399261556816715
Therefore, particularly out of respect for you, I must say that I do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this.	1.3786624754172805
I was told that this was a personal response.	1.139629359085861
Note will be taken of it in the Minutes.	1.1420182015752853
Madam President, particularly out of respect for you, for myself and for this House, I did not want to explicitly refer to the issue in question. However, as a Member of this House, as general secretary of a party in the Basque Country and as an ordinary citizen of Spain, I will do so now because of the extremely serious accusations made against individuals and against parties like my own, which has a long democratic tradition, and which has scrupulously respected and defended human rights for many years.	1.5335761816947144
Madam President, I want to express my concern that this clear defence by Mr Knörr Borràs of human rights apparently does not prevent his government from cooperating in Parliament with a political group which not only does not condemn, but collaborates with and encourages, violence against people and property.	1.249396674547745
I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject.	1.318057154449299
We are not going to enter into a debate now.	1.104772566760432
I shall give you the floor for any points of order after the vote.	1.0960832270979215

Madam President, I want to condemn the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council.	0.8551911185570608
On Third Pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice, it is unacceptable for the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to be absent.	1.0683410687947752
I also want to mention the translation problems, of which I will give just one example, as we do not have much time.	1.617987633505288
Correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts.	0.9228258657861583
Amendment No 83 in Italian, which is the original version, states that 'il minore deve essere assistito da una persona di sua fiducia o da un perito o legale esterno' .	0.902861181783513
The term 'legale esterno' has been translated into French as 'avocat neutre' . I have no idea what an 'avocat neutre' is.	1.2283627235460928
It rather seems like a contradiction in terms.	0.5568017804080836
However, in the Spanish version the 'abogado' has disappeared completely.	1.31624368332097
Madam President, you have said several times that this is a very serious problem.	1.685152526672589
The lawyer-linguists should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version is produced.	1.0517087577373085
Quite, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this is not the first time and it is indeed most worrying.	1.4464733777815089
We shall address this problem and check all the translations.	0.8958446156736493
Madam President, I simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote started, to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar.	1.487164485561423
I should like you, Madam President, to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future.	1.5048979479127458
Quite, I am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and I shall be most happy to pass this on.	1.3247520794978307

(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	0.20589797145868632
Madam President, in the heat of the moment I forgot to mention that, in my report on the excessive deficit procedure, the last paragraph of the explanatory statement contains a mistake in the Spanish version.	1.3504231024882065
An 's' has been omitted and instead of reading 'la propuesta nos parece correcta' , it reads 'la propuesta no parece correcta' which is completely the contrary.	1.0844939272815834

Report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission recommendation on a Council decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 - 1999/2121(COS))	0.8700502146730439
Relating to Amendment No 6	0.26217440790759694
. (DE) Madam President, I have an oral amendment which is in fact a clarification, because the passage concerned has been formulated differently in various translations.	1.2392014514233562
I hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this.	1.0959933021538015
The second sentence should read: '.., weshalb diese Hilfen' (which is why we have this aid), then 'ohne Bedingungen und' (unconditionally and) should be deleted, and it continues as follows: 'ohne Abhängigkeit von reziproken Anweisungen von seiten des Geberlandes gewährt werden müssen' . (and therefore that the aid must not be dependent on the reciprocal orders from the donor countries).	1.3441108462447193
This clarification would certainly meet with our approval.	0.7642511553622513
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?	0.7998026154310872
(Parliament agreed to the oral amendment) - Relating to Amendment No 9	0.9624388845124067
I just wanted to make it clear - as it has been translated differently here - that we always use the official name FYROM.	1.5017974046439968
Absolutely, I do not think that will pose a problem.	1.1994382504835586

Report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on procedures for implementing the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 - 'Comitology' (1999/468/EC)	1.0022549054059486
	-0.0
Madam President, I would like, with reference to this report, to underline the problem of translation: reference should be made to the French or Italian version, since the text adopted by this Parliament will also be the authoritative one for the Commission.	1.455206638246646
We have encountered several problems in some of the other languages, but have not been able to check all of these, and I would thus urge you to be mindful of problems of this type.	1.4060038864973414
Madam President, I voted in favour of the Schmidt report on the regulation of investments in transferable securities because, as I stated in this Chamber this morning, I consider it very important that the monies of the citizens of the European Union be put to good use.	1.4638028061901578
The vast majority of these citizens are elderly people and pensioners, who want a peaceful retirement and who, after the problems encountered during the course of their working lives, have at last found financial peace of mind.	1.288966711424605
The regulation of investments in transferable securities, the vast majority of which are made by elderly pensioners, is thus a major step forward for the European Union.	1.262390433891519
Report by Olle Schmidt (A5-0025/2000)	0.7745447143983618
. (SV) Olle Schmidt' s report is an improvement on the Commission' s proposal.	1.0988034942998577
I am not opposed to updating the common minimum regulations enabling a collective investment undertaking to obtain a so-called EU passport.	0.9406288371421319
However, I do not consider it would be appropriate to do this before all Member States have approved Commissioner Monti' s proposal for minimum taxes on capital.	1.5169808765921011
In its present form, the report will contribute to further liberalisation of the capital markets, in spite of the fact that what is most important is to restrain them.	1.3102112153711385
Like the whole of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I have therefore voted against the proposal to amend Directive No 1 and have abstained from voting on the proposal to amend Directive No 2.	1.2191891643763237
Brok report (A5-0029/2000)	0.5583549094232405
Madam President, there has recently been much talk of the importance of enlarging the European Union.	1.2560046570933785
We have before us Malta and Cyprus, which are two States keen to become members.	1.1961070441177712
Given that the complexity of the procedures has been greatly reduced, I voted in favour not only because this measure addresses the need for cohesion between these applicant States and the Union, but also because I believe that this should be taken as an invitation from Parliament to the Council and the Commission to ensure that Cyprus and Malta become fully-fledged members of the European Union as swiftly as possible.	1.4736374340018787
.	-0.0
(FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta, whose accession is vital to the future of the European Union in the Mediterranean.	1.1228298155330627
The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for Cyprus and Malta, starting in the year 2000 and lasting for five years (2000-2004).	1.1344130174573237
The proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire.	0.8870910171474083
This new move follows on from the step taken at the Helsinki European Council last December, when it was decided that Malta had made sufficient progress to warrant opening bilateral conferences in February 2000, i.e. by the end of this month, in order to commence negotiations on the conditions of accession to the Union and the adjustments required.	1.2244062675527287
As far as Cyprus is concerned, although the Council stated that a political settlement would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. It also stated that its decision on accession would be made without the above being a precondition, which I welcome.	1.2313802224517973
I have, in fact, always thought that insisting on a settlement of the present situation, in which one-third of this republic' s territory is occupied by Turkey, before starting negotiations with Cyprus was quite unfair.	1.2820715848163742
On a more general note, it is true that the socio-economic situation in these two countries is far better than in other candidate countries.	1.229014065312272
However, they have received technical assistance and financial aid from the European Union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire.	1.4850112747867978
Until 1999, this technical assistance and financial aid was provided under the fourth financial protocols (B7-4011).	1.0999443334654302
Both countries also qualify for financial aid under the MEDA programme (B7-4012).	0.8779938013031094
During the first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament stressed that the new 'pre-accession' heading (B7-0), proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget, should not be limited to the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe and should also be extended to Malta and Cyprus.	1.3000350062943729
However, because of the Council' s refusal to negotiate a review of the ceiling set for heading 7 (pre-accession) in the Financial Perspectives, the European Parliament agreed, by way of exception, and I stress that it was by way of exception, that this expenditure should be financed under heading 4 (external action) of the Financial Perspectives for the year 2000.	1.5148192841070287
At the same time, the European Parliament created a new heading: 'pre-accession strategy for Mediterranean countries' (B7-04), under which two new articles were created for the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus pending the Commission' s presentation, following the Helsinki European Council, of the necessary legal bases and a review of the ceiling for heading 7 of the Financial Perspectives.	1.3552880019678293
This proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases!	1.0775493382425252
. I welcome Mr Brok' s report supporting with amendments the Commission' s proposals seeking to prepare Cyprus and Malta for EU membership.	1.3271460158615827
The package will grant around Euro 15 million in total for the two countries in the current year.	1.0744788550642135
It is, however, regrettable that the Commission has eschewed multiannual financing and decided instead to allocate funds on a yearly basis.	1.1500117923412594
This is bound to have an impact on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan spending.	0.8971192905448022
The funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the Community 'acquis' .	1.1630246391003267
Given the already advanced state of these two countries, compared to other applicants, this should easily allow them to be 'technically and administratively' ready for membership at the end of the 5-year programme.	1.3057814796477731
Cederschiöld report (A5-0020/2000)	0.5048110637743843
.	-0.0
(FR) As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the last parliamentary term, I welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increasing protection for our single currency.	1.2617119207537162
The Union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting.	0.9001523455741162
Consumers and traders are still not familiar with the euro and it would be easy for counterfeit money to be passed in supermarkets, bureaux de change and banks and not be noticed straight away.	1.1006663294475838
And the fact that coins are to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify.	1.0107470253270792
The European information centres, which are already playing a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency, should step up their campaigns to raise public awareness of counterfeiting.	1.1753797435661364
On another level, we must ensure that Community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting.	1.1653815546789612
As far as criminal sanctions are concerned, measures are needed to guarantee protection for the euro from the outset and this is the purpose of the draft framework decision on increasing protection by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting presented by the European Parliament.	1.2873562053021856
The purpose of the framework decision is to supplement the provisions of the International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency of 20 April 1929 and to facilitate its application by the Member States.	1.0569580479636878
Each Member State must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable.	1.4097143254312128
These offences must be punishable even if they relate to banknotes and coins denominated in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 January 2002.	0.91590367134213
This is a basic element of the decision.	1.3305461728782182
I cannot but support the rapporteur in deploring the fact that the present national currencies from which the euro is to take over are not protected.	1.380398859128358
We must bear in mind that national currencies could continue to change hands for another 20 years!	0.9042513117951125
They should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation.	0.8437297209803969
It would also appear to be in the Union' s interest for all Member States to help protect the euro, especially Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Greece, which will not be introducing the euro on 1 January 2002.	1.5598044217446423
Although this framework decision is a step in the right direction, it confines itself to increasing criminal sanctions by harmonising substantive criminal law in the form of minimum standards.	1.0491872610124928
There is still no uniform criminal legislation on counterfeiting and there are 15 different national systems.	1.0633445401623245
That brings us back to the more general need to approximate criminal law called for by the European Council in Tampere.	1.098902384891398
.	-0.0
(DA) Mrs Cederschiöld' s report reflects an extremely peculiar form of logic. The EU introduces a common currency.	1.3614835987382135
The risk of counterfeiting increases. Counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire EU; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State.	1.1736661884287924
The harmonisation of criminal law or the introduction of minimum legal standards should not be legitimised against the background of problems of one' s own creation but from considerations of reason and necessity.	1.00177334949239
There is nothing to indicate that the Member States' legal principles, legal traditions and carefully tailored legal systems should be lost for reasons to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeiting. Nor, in the light of the international convention of 20 April 1929, can there be any confusion as to which country should deal with any criminal cases.	1.2368203708394279
We are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the abandonment of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such flimsy grounds. Instead, the focus should be upon preventing the real problem.	1.194228720840958
. I welcome this proposal to protect the Euro against forgers.	1.5499514117733413
When the notes and coins come into circulation after 1 January 2002, everything possible must be done to ensure maximum confidence in the Euro.	1.098154662508112
Di Pietro report (A5-0019/2000)	0.6476537823717314
Madam President, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party, there have been many occasions on which I have stated, at the committee stage, that the European Union must intervene in regulating the lives of the elderly, and in the measures and rules on pensions, as is already the case, in coordination.	1.459471846872719
Similarly, as concerns the field of justice and criminal law, which we have discussed today, I believe not only that the different criminal law, juridical and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated, but also that we must at last formulate common standards: an offence committed in Italy must also be viewed as an offence in Great Britain, Spain or elsewhere.	1.4564310661722475
I believe that we, the Parliament of the European Union, who are the elected representatives of the citizens, must give sharper impetus to ensuring that the European Union provides for the regulation of every facet of the lives of its citizens, including that of justice, and that of pensions.	1.5068694764336379
.	-0.0
We vote against this report, because by allowing trans-border interception of telecommunication and reversing the burden of proof, the Convention will create the legal ground for large scale bugging operations in the EU.	1.1456810819424255
That means, making a European bugging system like the transatlantic spying operation 'Echelon' perfectly legal.	0.900079060635185
This Convention will lead to gross abuses of people' s rights to privacy.	1.0873916236330532
It is a major threat to civil liberties in EU.	1.1886786917472685
Also the following points are unacceptable for us: joint investigation teams, controlled deliveries, undercover investigations, inaccuracy of the text on the scope of the convention, lack of respect of the principle of proportionality, lack of democratic guarantees.	1.1084985097844893
Resolution on the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005	0.6900248186037277
. Commissioner Prodi pointed out that 'Africa is our responsibility' and not apparently that of the USA and other major countries.	1.1842256446064585
I worked in Africa 30 years ago, and it was poor and underdeveloped but the problems are now more catastrophic.	1.2501782705970717
Two million people died of AIDS in Africa last year, approximately 200 000 died in wars.	0.8621251469907967
In Zambia 25% of teachers have died of AIDS.	0.7961354448892766
In some countries children had a better chance of basic education and health care twenty years ago than they have today.	0.9629172786607693
Our policies in Africa lack coherence.	0.7447834199743347
There is huge duplication of effort.	0.5091478608158778
Furthermore, the cloud of debt remains an obstacle to real development.	0.9825047971299742
It is patently clear that Africa has become the forgotten continent.	0.8611159733424767
.	-0.0
(FR) In its communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, the Commission repeats that Europe needs to become a 'global actor' capable of speaking with a strong voice in the world.	1.0845044452611818
What should this global actor' s objective be?	0.9771322052009198
Doubtless our citizens would say something along the lines of 'to defend the countries of Europe better' , since that is the traditional and primordial purpose of political associations.	1.2308900561446272
And yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen.	0.7050361627662873
All we find are vague phrases about 'strategic partnerships' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of Europe would apparently bring with it.	1.0329769440823913
The omission of this principal objective is highly revealing.	0.7800655491560895
It demonstrates one of the main flaws in the European Union, a little-known, almost always implicit flaw, but one which goes a long way towards explaining our citizens' loss of interest.	1.4075003700846798
There is a highly revealing passage on this point in the work programme for the year 2000 attached to the strategic guidelines.	1.3872432879011192
Addressing the fundamental question of relations with the United States, the Commission mentions just one priority: 'we will endeavour to reduce and eliminate as far as possible the disputes in transatlantic trade' (page 4).	1.2253074897043208
While we are on the subject, where one would expect a firm declaration of intent to defend European interests in the numerous trade conflicts under way, one merely finds the desire to eliminate conflict, which hardly sounds like determination on the part of the Commission to fight its corner.	1.2910230379802161
How strange that the Commission should lose its instinct for self-preservation just as Europe is integrating.	1.0921352140115588
I think there are three reasons for this: 1) in their endeavour to transcend the nation states, the European institutions have lost touch with the people and, in losing touch with the people, they have become putty in the hands of foreign interests; 2) having lost touch with the people, the men and women working in these institutions have started to become used to reasoning not as the sole champions of the people, but as international officials in charge of regulating a global system; 3) integration may afford economies of scale and productivity gains; but it also causes far more to be lost because, when it breaks nations, it breaks subtle expressions of solidarity and, with them, the willingness to present a united front.	1.4120001076513011
. (FR) I share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction expressed during the debate.	0.9336255304477461
I do, of course, understand the constraints of the moment and I am prepared to entertain the idea of the risk of failure....	1.2689185221317927
However, experience has taught me that, in politics, modest ambitions are never the key to success!	1.3959336444320147
I shall not keep saying that I am disappointed, because you need to hope in order to be disappointed.... and I have had no hope since the investiture debate.	1.6078174629062905
As for the future, given that the Commission has shown itself incapable of taking action against fascism in Austria, I am convinced that blocking measures to liberalise the single market is the only way of administering a salutary electric shock treatment to the heart of all the countries in the Union.	1.3536475512948045
- (IT) On behalf of the Italian Communists, I would like to express great dissatisfaction at the contents of the document, which was expected to define the strategic guidelines for Europe up until the year 2005.	1.3566442805843522
Employment: for many years now, the connection between economic growth and an increase in employment has not been borne out by reality, and yet, despite the fact that it has been proved to be useless, the same recipe is being put forward again as a solution to the acute problem of unemployment.	1.384477280403031
And yet our President is a fine economist.	0.8861117447531645
Pensions: The document states that, 'Member States must remain responsible for modernising social protection systems' , and yet the Commission itself intervened in the case of Italy, repeatedly calling for swift changes to the pension system to reduce rights and decrease pension payments.	1.3585254850397004
And yet President Prodi himself gave firm guidance to the Italian Government during those years and is therefore aware of the nature and extent of the sacrifices demanded of our fellow citizens and which they made in order to sign up to the euro, and he is aware of the major role played by Italy in European development.	1.2133764069025654
For this very reason, we cannot agree to cut pensions further.	1.1943149061839364
There is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in 2001 and this must not take place one moment sooner.	1.3419600602486899
What is more, the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control.	0.9408284086731602
I would therefore ask the Commission to please refrain from taking this unacceptable ideological approach and making such declarations which create instability and uncertainty among the citizens.	0.9867802568875591
I referred to the case of Italy, not only because the President is very familiar with it, but because Community statistics (Eurostat) themselves reveal that not only has Italy' s welfare expenditure - currently 25.9% - been below the Community average (28.2%) since 1990, but that it has also been well below that of countries considered to be doing well, such as Germany (29.9%) and France (30.8%).	1.297668219304158
Europe' s role: we first need to emphasise that Europe rejects war as an instrument for resolving international conflict: only then can we talk of the 'military' role of the Union.	1.1700080379066722
Agriculture and health: we see the issue differently from the Commission: in our view there are no consumers: there are only citizens who want to eat healthy food - products which are not designed for competitiveness but health, quality and respect for the environment.	1.4171814360741355
Moreover, these are factors which create employment.	1.3515437210151426
.	-0.0
(FR) The proposed action and programme presented by Mr Prodi are vague in the extreme and the social question is missing yet again.	1.234098859928031
In fact, the word seems to have been banished from the Commission' s vocabulary, whereas liberal and American references abound.	1.3577426095865708
Mr Prodi reverts to the contested concept of 'governance' ; contested because it favours state intervention over a proper working democracy and refers to the notion as defined by the IMF, whose ideological agenda is predicated solely on liberalism and monetarism.	1.0045540860403948
The shift in meaning is not just semantic... The only logical thing to do on reading this document is to pursue the mass market and generalised deregulation and forget about the realignment of European policy which our citizens hoped for.	1.220151589271905
Mr Prodi talks solely of 'mechanisms' and 'structures' and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people.	0.9255311344362344
Enlargement appears to be an end in itself, but unless decisions are made on a social policy, a common value and an institution to strengthen the cohesion and democratisation of the Union, the Europe bequeathed to us at the end of Mr Prodi' s presidency may well be a simple common market area within the context of generalised globalisation, rather than the community of destiny which we hope for.	1.3966420519022662
Finally, Mr Prodi' s complacency towards the Austrian Government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol (which in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence.	1.278938649768299

(FR) The European Union is flaunting its unbridled expansionist ambitions.	1.1897158667568
The Commission' s objective for the next five years is to become a 'global actor' by showing 'genuine leadership on the world stage' .	1.1509942063981875
The nature of the EU has not changed.	1.2831589894239042
Since the beginning it has served the interests of a few dozen large financial and industrial groups and their pressure groups.	1.1620964300647236
But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the EU so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United States, which it also sees as its future competitor and rival.	1.1616132601063291
This new imperial policy advocates reorganising European and national institutions, strengthening the power of the state, increasing competition, establishing a European army and redistributing financial resources.	1.097043185467008
Even daring to refer to the defence of a 'European social model' is a shamefaced lie because the more the EU combats the United States, the more it becomes its clone.	1.2451251277707067
We shall vote against these objectives, because we are fighting against this policy both in Parliament and on the streets.	1.2373890721796992
A European charter of fundamental rights would be the only ray of light in this policy but, yet again, there is no provision for the people of Europe themselves to be able to address and decide on this democratically.	1.3555520887873604
We abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution for the following reasons.	0.8673151238847534
Firstly, the motion does not condemn clearly enough the vagueness of the priorities and commitments indicated in the Commission' s programme.	1.2378567358851091
Secondly, in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years, we consider that the main question to be considered by the Commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the EU which neither the programme nor the motion mention.	1.4743721688479137
In our opinion, the Commission' s role in the near future will be dependent on some of the European political initiative being returned by the governments of the Member States following the Santer Commission scandal.	1.2736875916415202
This is very positive as this is how the national parliaments, on which the governments depend, will continue to show that their democratic mandate is indispensable to European construction.	1.3852221915406193
The truth is that the European Parliament is still failing to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which is determined not to think about Europe, as demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections.	1.299528281525364
The mechanisms used in the cooperation between the governments of the Member States must therefore be reinforced and made more coherent, more transparent and more democratic.	1.1885695957296905
We welcome the efforts of Mr Prodi to improve the public image of the Commission and the need for the latter to agree with this House and the Council.	1.629871731447101
However, the priority should be to reform the governmental cooperation mechanisms, particularly by creating a Council of Ministers for Europe which, by itself and in coordination with the other European institutions, can assume the responsibility for transforming the political decisions of the European Councils into specific actions.	1.5256449029864183
Corrie report (A5-0032/2000)	0.5763060279719239
Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly was coloured in 1999 by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation models derived from the Lomé Conventions.	1.018450192030051
Back in 1994, the Joint Assembly passed an initial resolution, in which our fellow Member Dominique Souchet was closely involved, expressing its alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which contradicted the very principle of Community preference which was fundamental to this cooperation.	1.2348286976251246
These fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them.	1.0389242188976269
The developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade, despite their vulnerable economies.	1.1600533475537442
Although Mr Corrie' s report roundly condemns this situation and reaffirms the Joint Assembly' s attachment to the Lomé model, he fails to highlight properly a second problem which, to tell the truth, is also the result of the free-trade error, namely the incoherence of the regional trade agreements signed by the European Union.	1.3539874009033162
The cooperation agreement with South Africa is a prime example.	0.805800814552704
The Council approved the agreement negotiated by the Commission despite the fact that a basic section, namely agriculture, had not been finalised.	1.3607128665219717
As Paul-Marie Coûteaux rightly said in his intervention yesterday and in his proposed amendments, one wonders exactly what political coherence this blank cheque represents.	1.016046167623545
It is most worrying, especially as a similar agreement with Mexico appears to be taking shape.	1.2586973469388663
Nor is it possible to support the rapporteur' s call for the European Development Fund to be merged with the Community budget.	1.2063023029485676
We want to maintain the clear commitment and the responsibility of each Member State, which is made possible by its intergovernmental nature.	1.2613498663842935
Alas, there have been far too many instances of collective aid for which no-one feels responsible being derailed and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the EDF.	1.1701023635463146
Madam President, I welcome Mr Corrie' s report as a balanced assessment of the work the Assembly has carried out over the last year.	1.3954814217590936
The report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing Lomé Convention, which expires at the end of this month.	1.082225942697081
The new agreement provides for a development budget of EUR 13.5 billion over the next seven years.	0.9642398360103964
It is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the ACP countries.	1.1341326997834482
Strenuous efforts must be made to root out corruption and waste.	0.8925074717518585
Civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects.	0.8133979515467701
The decision to include a clause obliging ACP countries to take back illegal immigrants entering Europe is worrying and will have to be implemented with extreme sensitivity.	1.2815516099957978
I hope that before the end of this new Lomé Convention we will be able to welcome Cuba as a full member.	1.447334502992203
. The joint United Nations programme on AIDS estimated that by the end of 1998, there was a total of 33.4 million people in the world living with the HIV infection.	1.267778732949549
Over 95% of all HIV infected individuals live in the developing countries and sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected region in the world.	1.12122491895182
While only around 10% of the world' s population live in sub-Saharan Africa, 70% of all people who became infected with the AIDS virus in 1998 live there.	1.1897045698929247
80% of the 13.9 million AIDS related deaths in the world have taken place in this region.	1.2533355248884084
The AIDS problem in Africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one.	1.1264880358068965
The effects of the AIDS pandemic mean that any progress in development matters in the sub-Saharan region is being neutralised or reversed.	0.9004197330160463
From the data which I am referring to today, it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate toll on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide-ranging impact.	1.1780839726370493
It is clear that the spread of AIDS in the sub-Saharan African Continent is linked to poverty.	0.8587288991862495
AIDS treatments that may cost $18 000 per annum for one person are obviously not affordable by countries whose annual health budget may be less than $5 per capita.	0.8744373942854143
It is incumbent on the European Union and the United Nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner.	1.3678269364812592
We must primarily ensure that the basic needs of the poorest people in the countries most affected by the AIDS disease are fully met. These countries include Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.	1.2393730002864738
Prevention education should begin early in the primary school curriculum in these countries.	0.8920827286902432
Appropriate messages about the health effects of AIDS must be delivered to primary school children by teachers who are comfortable with the information that they are trying to communicate.	0.9608358381629741
Health facilities and staff of NGOs need to be supported and resourced to deal effectively and appropriately with patients.	1.0344896675696424
It is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective.	1.166946802351129
At a more central level, there is a need for more effective co-ordination between government donors, international NGOs, indigenous NGOs and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted.	1.0230688650450874
Already weak economies are being further weakened in Africa by the AIDS virus.	0.9200719767553736
Already stretched resources are being further stretched.	0.8363015602248838
50% or more of hospital beds are now occupied by someone suffering with an AIDS related disease in the countries where AIDS figures are highest.	1.131867139098018
On a separate matter altogether, I would like to support Cuba' s membership as an ACP country within the framework of the new Lomé Convention which will shortly be agreed between the European Union and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.	1.174476453843709
I know that this is somewhat controversial, particularly, because of the attitude of the United States Government towards the Castro regime.	1.2317443928554115
However, on this occasion, the European Union will be insisting on introducing political criteria into the Lomé Convention Accord.	1.668592736126848
Good governance criteria broadly covering questions of refugees, corruption, human rights and democracy will be part of the finalised accord between the European Union and all countries signing the Lomé Convention from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific region.	1.21998225460677
.	-0.0
(FR) The Lomé Convention, on which the entire structure of relations between the European Union and the 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries rests, is still the most efficient and ambitious development tool in north-south relations.	1.2207922472925652
After years of 'good and loyal service' it is still the main symbol of efforts by the European Union to promote development and improve the lot of the poorest countries.	1.2796425276878909
It is the humane face of Europe...	1.0803043104797632
And the merit of Mr Corrie' s report is that it highlights the value of this original, proactive development instrument, together with the work carried out by the Joint Assembly.	1.0242364009487792
Especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure has been threatened.	0.8997909154951063
The partnership between the European Union and the ACP was negotiated in the difficult time of the changeover to the new millennium.	1.3728081062792223
I am delighted that reason and generosity triumphed over the difficulties, opening new prospects for this partnership.	0.9507327007438233
Now, more than 30 years after the inauguration of an unprecedented partnership between north and south, the tool which has proven its worth and served its time needs to be adapted in order to meet new challenges.	1.2402156810408638
Which is why the new 20-year agreement due to be signed in Fiji on 31 May represents more than the simple renewal of the Conventions regulating relations between Europe and the ACP.	1.2053331957023465
It should seal their revival.	0.4811366269859973
It brilliantly illustrates the political dimension of a partnership which constitutes the only forum for dialogue and political exchange within north-south relations.	0.9110402256810004
At a time when the Joint Assembly is opening its doors ever wider to the elected representatives from parliaments in the ACP, this dimension must not only be preserved; above all, it must be encouraged.	1.3246445561697353
The Joint Assembly also represents the tribunal before which the countries of Europe and the developing countries defend their common interests.	1.1696442612622004
After the debacle in Seattle, our duty from now on is to adopt a concerted position and ensure that the rules of world trade develop and are used to fight poverty.	1.23766886229427
The partnership is here to stay and the way is clear for it to be modernised.	1.2304896710445
First, by promoting a trend towards regional meetings of the Joint Assembly, as recommended in the Corrie report, thereby enabling working methods to be adapted to the new types of cooperation envisaged (regional economic partnership agreements).	1.3021102475489994
Then, by gearing actions to micro-projects and making them accessible to the civil society in the southern countries and, finally, by calling for enlargement and the rapid accession of Cuba, which all the ACP called for at Nassau and which has now made a formal application.	1.4117816922319404
But we must also preserve the original spirit of the Lomé Convention, which has enabled relations between the European Union and the ACP to become what they are today: a real partnership based on fairness and mutual respect.	1.3088356187974592
.	-0.0
(FR) A few days after the demonstrations in Seattle, the ministers of the European Union imposed an agreement compatible with the rules of the WTO on the ACP, i.e. their former colonies.	1.4835062755248218
Apart from reducing the volume of exports from these countries to the Community market, what we term 'development aid' to the ACP has fallen constantly, from 70% of total European Union aid in 1986 to 30% in 1998.	1.3308883056697844
The European Union prefers to send its funds to Eastern Europe, the former USSR and Asia, where there is greater opportunity for profit.	1.330820369444184
The ACP-EU agreements make a mockery of democratic principles and the fight against corruption, by sparing those who are responsible: when will sanctions and controls be imposed on Total-Elf, which is supplying those responsible for the civil war in the Congo?	1.243189214757436
Or on Shell?	0.34460697728593714
Although the market is presented as the only rule which applies to ACP-EU relations, the European Union also plans to police immigration, as article 13 hints, in order to justify the policy of the European states against illegal immigrants.	1.4696275507688956
We do not accept this agreement, which deprives people of the wherewithal to build societies which are independent of the European multinationals and banks.	1.4048088979653444
. Mr President, I am full of praise at the sterling efforts of MEPs --some of my Labour colleagues among them - on the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and their efforts towards securing a new Lomé Agreement, which will benefit some of the poorest countries in the world.	1.3137641178534893
Few of my constituents will probably be aware that the EU is the biggest foreign aid donor in the world.	1.1504324640718546
While others may have the biggest rockets, the EU has the deepest pockets.	1.332867855422541
This is something that the EU can rightly be proud of, and I think we should shout it from the rooftops more often.	1.3968303880352477
The Labour Government' s record in Britain is also a proud one.	0.9375354398699903
Clare Short, MP, is one of the few Cabinet-level Ministers for international development in the world and, as such, can take her case to the very heart of government.	1.4316754142244696
Gordon Brown, MP, meanwhile, has led international efforts to relieve crippling levels of Third World debt and ensured that Labour' s campaign to reduce poverty does not end at the English Channel.	1.0201190542657967
Whether through the minimum wage in Manchester or debt relief in Durban, Labour' s aim of poverty reduction remains the same.	0.8217602657524291
There is still much to be done, however.	1.2282887127826492
The next great challenge is to re-launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last December in Seattle.	0.8888450703098603
It must be a 'development round' , in which developing countries, effectively excluded from previous rounds, are fully included.	1.439633635080775
For the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves.	1.012428927489005
Developing countries want trade not aid, a help up not a hand-out.	1.0347333791411508
And the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open up world markets to allow them to sell their products.	0.985795818115775
In this way, the power of globalisation can be harnessed for the good, to benefit the poor not just the wealthy, the many not just the few.	1.4471421277549281
Thus, whether through the New Deal in Newcastle or fair trade in Freetown, Labour' s aim of opportunity for all remains the same.	0.9842567372760063
Swoboda report (A5-0031/2000)	0.576762853275946
. (EL) The EU' s Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in the form of a joint agreement as established by Article 310 of the EU Treaty, can contribute to the stabilisation and development of that Balkan republic.	1.2751290729417262
In parallel, it can benefit from substantial financial support via the PHARE programme.	1.1806419654391476
However, the EU' s present policy in the Balkans is fragmentary, inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature.	1.419745061566857
There are different types of agreements or relations or lack of relations - going even as far as the embargo on Yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach.	1.2662450939796166
There is no sense of regionality for the Balkans, which would include everyone without exceptions or vindictiveness.	1.255124102771196
Finally, intervention by the European Union to solve the problem of FYROM' s name - which is unfortunately becoming a long drawn out problem and could make an already tense situation even more fraught - and to respond more energetically towards negotiating FYROM' s principles within a reasonable time scale, is necessary and useful.	1.4495089471880975
.	-0.0
(FR) The Commission' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the Community would appear to respond to a primary concern: a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south-east Europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the Second World War.	1.113073632622824
Having been crushed beneath the heel of triumphant Communism, this region has not stopped paying the price for the collapse of the Soviet system since the beginning of the 1990s.	1.1217552353510731
And yet, under these difficult conditions, especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO, some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community.	1.2885000333064514
In this sense, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case.	0.933553718216913
Exemplary because it proves that the Balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the European Union in stability and association agreements.	1.2823865084910002
Symbolic because it reflects well on the Fifteen' s project to see the birth of a policy which is common to the five countries in the region (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM and Albania) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement.	1.249208716398201
The UEN Group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states. A satisfactory solution cannot be found in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion.	1.175953190995456
The Union is simply doing its job when it seeks through its cooperation policy to encourage nations to espouse a platform of common values with it, of which democracy and civil liberty are the cornerstone.	1.1592053946897383
It is not its job to subrogate to people in their choices or, failing that, reinvent a new variation on a 'sense of history' which perceives self-determination as a one-way street.	1.1463807567411088
The Community construction only makes sense if it creates positive discriminations alone, and the UEN Group hopes that this signal to FYROM and specific action in its wake will help us make a sustainable contribution to the development and peaceful coexistence of the nation states in this fully-paid up part of Europe.	1.2032905515416283
Frassoni Report (A5-0021/2000)	0.5922495323492025
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs Monica Frassoni' s report, according to which the European Parliament is to accept the agreement entered into with the Commission about the implementing provisions for the Council' s decision of 28 June 1999 concerning comitology.	1.2899695028742895
In all matters, we attach importance to the fact that there should be the greatest possible transparency in connection with the decision-making procedures involved in EU cooperation, for example with a view to guaranteeing the necessary democratic control.	1.465581665793625
Through the agreement, the European Parliament will automatically be sent the relevant material in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under Article 251 of the Treaty.	1.2717212911969078
We should also like to see this arrangement extended to other areas in which, following the agreement, the European Parliament' s relevant committees will be sent material when they ask for it.	1.296213641841477
With the approval of this agreement, we have not achieved the final goal of transparency and democratic control where the comitology procedures are concerned. However, it constitutes real progress in the right direction, which is something we do not wish to obstruct.	1.4019576800848619

Company restructuring in Europe	0.1078857968451457
The next item is the Commission statement - Company restructuring in Europe.	1.0865599175269454
. Mr President, industrial change, which can be gradual or sudden, is driven by new technologies, worldwide competition or consumer preferences.	1.2782156612868418
It has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion, but it also provides major new opportunities when anticipated, prepared for and managed.	1.1949978093257525
The acceleration of technological progress and the increasing competitive pressure of globalising markets are pushing companies to rapidly adapt their production and company structures.	0.8907776320817798
Companies must be able to anticipate and identify at an early stage what they need to do to ensure the continuity of their activities.	1.2211760141738603
Sometimes this calls for mergers of activities.	0.5875669647701243
The Commission is acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult times of change.	1.2935623298210295
We are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis.	1.0013040926573136
We have had in the recent past different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large-scale operations of corporate restructuring, often affecting the lives of large numbers of European people.	0.9897569959472899
In some cases these operations were prepared well in advance, fully involving workers' representatives, with due care being taken to search for the least damaging solutions.	1.212249704456839
Where necessary, workers likely to be affected were prepared through employability measures to face the challenge of sudden unemployment.	1.0253627010474862
In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected.	0.9049961624341029
On every occasion, and as recently as last October in this House, the Commission has highlighted the following basic positions.	1.418095989884557
Firstly, decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management.	1.400884875929452
This means that, when contemplating actions likely to lead to serious social consequences, job losses for example, companies should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution.	1.2088744269609681
Secondly, when dismissals prove to be inevitable, the utmost must be done to reinforce the employability of those concerned.	1.424897691996786
This requires anticipation, timely preparation and careful management of these processes.	0.8719917633251871
Thirdly, nothing can justify the absence of timely, effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers' and employees' representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced.	1.255979860741211
Worker involvement is always, and particularly in the event of corporate restructuring, not only a basic right but a necessary precondition for the social acceptance of such operations.	1.4113716222614212
In the end it is also a decisive factor of their success, as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust, dialogue, partnership and solidarity between its different components.	1.2362837879120807
These basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in Europe.	0.855292769377007
This is what intelligent restructuring is about.	1.0405362449006788
It is more and more rare to see companies embark on damaging restructuring operations ignoring these fundamental concerns, as unfortunately was sometimes the case in the past.	1.0239015665962312
We have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the European Union.	1.0720394784507505
We have set minimum requirements at European level, which all Member States and all companies must observe when contemplating job losses, especially when they are massive, or preparing other decisions likely to affect workers.	1.4066783079262812
The collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings directive and the European works council directive constitute our legal framework, protecting the workers' rights and ensuring fair standards in the field of information and consultation at national and transnational level respectively.	1.1231556338882362
As regards the national and/or local level of employee involvement, the Commission wishes to underline again the need for proper information and consultation of employees' representatives before any redundancies are decided or implemented, as provided for in the collective redundancies directive and in other national provisions.	1.333794389266127
I wish to recall that it is, in principle, up to national courts to deal with possible violations of these rules, if and when they are brought before them by national representatives.	1.2500844683367376
However, even when existing rules or arrangements are formally respected this does not mean that management' s attitude is socially irreprehensible.	1.3298715966380221
In fact, the Commission has argued for some time now that the rules we have established are not sufficient to deal with the challenges of today.	1.4576318515383009
In a world characterised by permanent change and in the context of high levels of unemployment, the rules in force seem to us to be outdated as they do not allow or promote the key ideas behind our employment strategy and our approach to change, anticipation, risk prevention and employability.	1.1915523245035655
That is why in November 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support.	1.1673844108594005
We thank you for that.	1.1101013425557213
Unfortunately, the other branch of the legislative power, the Council, has not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begun working on it.	1.569031016513399
I hope that this debate contributes to reminding Member States of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative.	1.4670750641952908
We have recently heard from the Portuguese Presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched.	1.3345610177335294
The forthcoming French Presidency also seems willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserves.	0.9526524422942872
The Commission sincerely hopes that Parliament and the Council quickly finalise this important dossier which constitutes, in our view, the most effective answer to the concerns raised by cases such as the ones which brought us here today.	1.2897369779466648
As for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their European workforce.	1.1773627676267144
They may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force.	0.9797360212276028
The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this.	1.3102683692114436
In any case, I wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them, notably through relevant national jurisdictional instances.	1.2599447965233557
The Commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the European Works Council Directive.	1.1246917650274686
As recognised in the report, which we will adopt in the forthcoming weeks, we accept that the directive contains some loopholes.	1.525791556747508
Nevertheless, as my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions, when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately, different considerations must be taken into account.	1.4089379587478414
First, any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies.	1.2939410609864153
Secondly, an immediate revision would make things much more complicated as regards progress in respect of the other pending dossiers in this field like European company statutes and the national information and consultation proposal.	1.3265371389154736
The successful outcome of these other dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the EWC Directive and even provide some degree of a solution to the problems identified above.	0.97674340171923
That is why we tend to consider that it might be more appropriate in this context to proceed with the revision of the European Works Council Directive only after the conclusion of those two dossiers and following a more complete evaluation of the application of the directive.	1.2478834693156629
Action is not limited to legislation.	0.8060136689547184
To encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the Commission is also developing the recommendations of the Lillehammer Report by preparing the setting up of a European observatory on industrial change.	1.131187168954596
We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group, the Managing Change Report.	1.2198133810388716
Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House.	1.1837411795739596
As for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy, let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers' representatives to be heard by the Commission in the framework of the relevant procedure.	1.252879583660939
Generally speaking, we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations, including their effects in terms of employment.	1.301835173744155
As an example of this I mention that public authorities, notably the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment.	1.2252192022869262
To this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years.	1.067563171860436
The same provision was included in the Structural Funds Regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds.	1.0689034495701677
Social cohesion and the interplay of policies at EU-level is the focus of the forthcoming Lisbon Summit.	1.175817022560758
I know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe.	1.2462812799411849
Thank you very much Commissioner.	0.850446390633062
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I understand you have a point of order.	1.3170161508102947
If it is a personal statement, would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate, at which stage I would be happy to call you?	1.4599439501671267
Mr President, the problem is one of public honour in this Parliament, it is not a personal statement.	1.4814249567380782
This morning, the President of Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order.	1.2300188227116167
Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Madam President has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me.	1.2112007069131852
In doing so, Madam President has breached Rule 142 that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak.	1.0260829089759955
She has also breached Rule 122 that gives the right to all the Members of this House to make observations, observations which in this case refute the remarks made by another deputy, Mr Vidal-Quadras.	1.254330028775681
This partisan behaviour of our President should be criticised most firmly.	0.7888047150963332
I will willingly accept Madam President' s apologies any time.	0.7299135618648611
Thank you for your statement.	0.6156736385761001
We will certainly make sure that the President is informed of your statement.	1.2480555202903816
I can assure you that as far as I am aware the President never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote.	1.227957773313144
Therefore the House was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage.	0.9228618538179879
But thank you for your remarks.	0.9963522310920795
Mr President, I welcome Commissioner Liikanen' s words, and I am contributing to the debate - we are all contributing to the debate - because, although the subject is broad in scope, it also concerns a specific fact.	1.5646533967522818
The subject in question is of great political and social importance.	1.2784855461888534
Free enterprise, free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the European Union.	1.2379061931497286
Company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments, and must therefore be defended.	1.2168484358692309
However, all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles.	1.4104634459016858
Today, we are witnessing one of these cases, which, on the surface, may seem to be of minor importance and affect only the specific industry, but which, if it is allowed to pass without an authoritative intervention by the European Union, will become an unwritten rule which will cause problems for many of the Member States and the Union as a whole.	1.4583702764487736
An American company - Goodyear - with production sites in Italy, Germany and England, is reviewing its production and relocation, justifiably, in its own view.	1.36523386336546
However, it seems to be doing it without observing the relevant Community legislation, for it is certainly not giving reasonable notice to employees or heeding the obligation to render an account of their use of Italian and European public finances.	1.2436678865711985
In Italy, Commissioner Liikanen, Goodyear is not carrying out restructuring but closing a plant whose production covers 14% of the market and which Goodyear itself defined as, 'having the most highly-skilled workforce of all its plants' , a plant which was opened with a total of EUR 85 million of European capital.	1.2548365183444208
No notice was given of the closure, and no intention was shown of discussing the fate of the plant or its workers, despite the fact that the public funds invested in that plant make it much more public than private.	1.2662624730733163
It would be a serious matter if every non-European company were to learn to use Europe as a bus where you do not have to pay for the ticket, you do not have to pay for cooperation, you benefit from using the facility and you leave without being accountable to anyone.	1.2976569692740685
Europe has to guarantee every sort of freedom, including freedom to use one' s own money for the purposes of one' s own freedom and not to let others use it at will, others who make demands and then, when the break is made, refuse even to discuss the terms of the break, despite the fact that this is a break which has been declared unilaterally.	1.3353091409737277
Just now, Commissioner Liikanen was talking of restructuring which must not be uninformed.	1.235713716068074
Sadly, in this case, he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring.	1.4101533891570333
I would also like to point out to Commissioner Liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court.	1.317107962527569
Of course, it is always possible, but when jobs have been lost and factories closed down, the idea of going to Court when proceedings are as lengthy as they are in Italy is not very reassuring.	1.458211589158773
Commissioner Liikanen, we expect an authoritative intervention.	1.0283229317621778
As Parliament, we are, of course, expecting to be able to contribute to the resolution you mentioned - we are ready and waiting - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this, which can on no account be allowed to reach its conclusion and be forgotten, as has almost happened already.	1.4865760442657787
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the second time within the space of four months, we find ourselves debating the restructuring of companies in Europe.	1.150694075990445
This is - as it was the first time round - sparked off by the reorganisation of large companies, which is linked to a drop in employment.	1.4528571547308822
I would like to make it quite clear that the Liberal Group is against any political interference in companies, in terms of both finance and management.	1.1542178089440145
Our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed.	1.0987771535742383
It appears that Goodyear in Italy received Italian and European subsidies to the tune of approximately EUR 40 million.	0.9672286842400588
The company went under despite this.	0.549098276670027
This goes to show that jobs cannot be bought.	0.8013265658940801
The market is a law unto itself.	0.899335321381545
As such, state aid costs the government twice: first in subsidies and then in unemployment benefit.	1.1365923563025035
Surely this cannot be the role of your, my and the citizens' tax money?	1.3829076333524153
All this, of course, does not mean that our Group does not share the concern of the Italian Members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned.	1.1908937511118924
My Group is also opposed in principle to the naming of specific companies in this resolution, for two reasons: firstly because this creates selective responsibility.	1.2766775417852123
A company is pilloried one day and not the next.	1.0127116876454443
Why should this be the case?	1.0678628853225693
Michelin caused a great stir.	0.642259803563384
But I did not hear a squeak when Nissan and IBM were discussed, where, similarly, a great number of European employees were involved.	1.230762095857161
Secondly, this is not fair towards employees of other companies where reorganisations also take place and where it hurts too.	1.3837964865646357
My Group has signed a joint resolution with EPP and UEN, in which, however, we made it clear right from the outset that we are against the naming of company names.	1.3702315426683427
This is why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9.	1.244632840665224
If these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted, my Group will abstain from the final vote.	0.9376770492398846
I do hope that this will not be necessary.	1.0839275413903136
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 both talk of full employment for which two essential conditions are required.	1.1560091806948225
The first is to create new jobs for young people entering the labour market and the second is not to lose jobs.	1.5970652923440594
Yet the current situation in Europe provides us with clear examples of how jobs are being destroyed, particularly, and most seriously, by companies which are making huge profits.	1.3522534653509395
In the past, workers were asked to show their solidarity with companies in order to ensure their survival. Now the companies are making huge profits but are also making workers redundant.	1.1897540383456302
Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy.	1.0024036598011192
There is also another hidden way of making workers redundant, as practised for example in Spain by the Ericsson company under the term 'externalising' . Note that sensitive words like 'redundancy' are not used.	1.1808778774581514
Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights.	0.8192763508169595
This is just an underhand way of making workers redundant.	0.7155737313763466
Commissioner, if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment, they must take clear steps to secure this.	1.578440423520368
They must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations. They must revise the directive on collective redundancies, reduce the working day, link European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union.	1.248711991785657
Mr President, sadly, once again, Parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in Europe.	1.1484969200908934
Yet again, workers are likely to lose their jobs.	0.8751218251263696
This time, I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina.	1.0853354101688697
As has already been pointed out, in one month' s time, 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income.	1.1602863512799335
Despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe - these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle, while Goodyear, after years of benefiting from state and European subsidies, is totally free to walk out.	1.4022545625215026
I do not think this is at all fair, either to the workers at the Cisterna plant or to all those Italian and European citizens whose taxes have, albeit indirectly, enabled Goodyear to benefit from the state aids I have just mentioned.	1.3130686053991583
The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs.	1.4324865660479682
Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant.	1.3048091311199637
Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to remind the House that there is very little time available, and therefore that any measure - including those already cited by the Commission in its introductory report - which we adopt must have an immediate, timely effect.	1.494788760927408
Mr President, Commissioner, as far as restructuring goes, there is no doubt that European companies must adapt so that they are better placed to face new challenges or go under.	1.18004096280661
We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management.	1.082774933976569
Although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares, this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of financiers, often shareholders, with the sole unavowed aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company.	1.324027538715981
The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers, be they by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this respect.	1.1200351802747326
Rationalised management and improved profits should, in my view, serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost, and any financial benefits should follow.	1.1590446013835167
However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit.	1.2922645654305158
There is a very real risk of seeing a two-headed monster emerge on this planet, with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital.	1.1742568387429353
Surely Europe should act as a safeguard, maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare?	0.9852310897659036
We must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results.	1.1038970140028055
Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for 'difference' .	1.1567976165043141
Europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs. Without doubt, the voice of difference in this monotonous flood of restructuring.	1.0857014923773791
Mr President, last month in the UK, in a region that neighbours mine, the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres.	1.3758870073664227
I, like all Members present, am saddened by this loss of jobs.	1.0980458192214266
Equally, I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution.	1.1672940215051704
But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company' s decision.	1.2196877485312694
This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes, in this institution, forget that Europe cannot survive alone.	1.3349564124472277
We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent.	0.7794992054722671
In my few months here, I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU, nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave.	1.2564145525535568
In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted.	1.207956292578878
Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant.	1.1733622503345362
In a world where surely less regulation is the key, we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union, untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens.	1.376363288997242
We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them.	1.0356288333609995
Take a large successful business, add European regulations, and within months you have created a small one.	1.1046188982117262
Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here.	1.1442643574712699
Mr President, I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today.	1.2267160210478127
In this respect, I share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s view that we cannot talk about these in detail.	1.3249422633540158
But maybe next time, we ought to discuss CORUS, the merger which has now taken place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel.	1.256510046743448
I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the European Union and policy in other fields.	1.266680609632856
In this light, I am pleased that Mr Liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion, where the interests of employees are concerned, with Mrs Diamantopoulou but we can involve the Commissioners who are active in other fields.	1.3952455793880325
I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission' s policy from these different vantage points, unlike my predecessor, who holds the belief that there is no need for rules.	1.3044731224212363
We need to gain an insight into what companies are like now.	0.9719782553361334
At present, we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition.	1.0508705010103807
What remains of the concept of what a company should be like now is naturally very relevant: whether it is merely the property and toy of shareholders, or whether it is a more broadly based stakeholder society, which is meant to guarantee continuity for staff, consumers, suppliers and the local population and has, in addition, a social function.	1.3679626985094744
As such, I would like to ask these various Commission directorates and these various Commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments.	1.199920098408847
I think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in Europe, as company policy forms part of this.	1.4022878128288396
The government is talking to trade union and Goodyear delegates in Italy as well, in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopted by the North American multinational in Cisterna di Latina, an area of Central Italy which has already been affected by other restructuring operations.	1.3079492124269452
The closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty.	0.8749895593464518
The Goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight, in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the Goodyear workers in the different European countries as well, and there are many of them: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia.	1.3596075141257271
Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits.	1.3424349038819208
The European Union, in all of its aspects, must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes.	1.6040765492396145
Mr President, earlier this week President Prodi announced that one of the Commission' s strategic objectives for the next five years would be to aim for full employment.	1.251508246298376
He acknowledged that 15 million Europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion.	1.0389349537986874
What is more, the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority.	0.9444021005024034
Yet, all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies.	0.9935735297127296
The Commission' s decision to allow the ABB-Alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point.	1.2146354019464474
The new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings.	0.9236097299053126
This global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs.	0.7993142291756111
In my region of the UK in particular the employment consequences of this merger have been severe as a result of ABB-Alsthom having announced that it was cutting 270 jobs in Britain with 95 jobs being lost in Stafford and 112 in Rugby.	1.1503220780367804
The company' s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying.	0.9754599880502477
It is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee.	1.0083651215497427
Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation, adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States.	1.135807631255024
I do not think it is simply a matter of a Community charter.	1.540321630453876
EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer.	1.040228567610826
The Commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences.	1.2228031069515763
We need more joined-up policy making on these issues.	0.9122586999864227
What we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation.	1.0997094495853836
This is the only way of respecting Article 127 of the Treaty.	1.08811822510388
I welcome the statement made by Commissioner Liikanen, but I also look for the support of this Parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have passed on workers' rights is implemented rigorously and to ensure that impact assessments on the workforce for proposed mergers are undertaken as a matter of course.	1.4142095317157797
I have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	0.7514931462248257
That concludes the debate.	0.19308667519260808
The vote will be taken later this evening.	1.1412291917152213
The sitting was suspended at 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.05 p.m.	0.7560879569469271
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	0.2004388419834845
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	0.4698836304410891
Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain)	0.2506847922778797
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	0.5970435025992148
B5-0149/2000 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on outbreaks of racism and xenophobia in the El Ejido area in Spain;	0.9056557724606452
B5-0159/2000 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Sánchez García, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain);	0.804207792198094
B5-0162/2000 by Mrs Díez González and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the outbursts of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	0.8386552667695665
B5-0169/2000 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on outbursts of xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	0.8747690284899294
B5-0175/2000 by Mr Bautista Ojeda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on xenophobia-related incidents in El Ejido (Spain).	0.8449060414136832
Mr President, I am reassured by the fact that the first three speakers in this debate are intimate with this situation given our African origin.	1.4453029519910794
I must firstly congratulate the groups in this House on the high degree of consensus achieved in the motion for a resolution. I am aware of the efforts made by Members to avoid using an issue such as this for electoral purposes.	1.3094695753080887
Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone.	1.3271134513246432
We should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner.	1.1144399688644644
These events, which are unfortunately overshadowing the political decisions in this area, confirm without doubt that the development of the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the EC Treaty must be an urgent priority.	1.2932822382647664
Today' s problems cannot be solved in five years.	1.019527070243166
They will take a long time, as we are finding out.	1.3907884388973273
The legislation of the Member States must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in Tampere, as paragraph 7 of the motion states.	1.4593626979920775
Legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays.	0.790882139860162
Furthermore, the labour market must be organised realistically so that jobs held by third country nationals are subject to labour legislation on wages, social security and social protection in terms of equality. This will eradicate the labour exploitation and markets in marginalised people, which are resulting in the events condemned by the motion, and which are the real basis of the current social problem.	1.4402539265118492
Solidarity, dialogue and agreements between local, regional, national and European institutions and employers, unions and the immigrant communities themselves, whose countries of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility, are essential.	1.2670403739266665
Collaboration with the countries of origin on this issue is vital. In this respect, the action plans approved by the High Level Group and the Tampere European Council must be allocated a budget.	1.4716153580563247
Specifically, I must stress in this debate the plan for Morocco. This is a country with which the European Union has an effective relationship and common interests and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration.	1.5345510073489388
Finally, this House must tackle the phenomenon of immigration with sufficient calm to avoid increasing tension in a debate which must go much further than the appropriate words and condemnations prompted by such behaviour.	1.2042727958930948
This is a very important social debate in the creation of a European area in which the right to freedom, security and justice will be recognised in the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.3105531318407921
Mr President, Commissioner, whenever a serious social problem occurs, it always has a political basis. This is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in El Ejido.	1.301793430189682
The proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this House have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions.	1.1594835198079545
We all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers.	0.9041513066088186
We all, I believe, agree in our condemnation of the xenophobia and racism which was apparent in certain actions.	1.0839445389377953
These events certainly have their origin in, among other factors, the absence of a clear immigration policy allowing the affected communities to live together respectfully and peacefully.	1.1681172976364291
We hope that the events in El Ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated.	1.1024355951363622
Yet it is not enough to regret the situation.	1.0770512612190983
We do not want Africa to become our cross, in fact quite the contrary.	1.5518795859060057
We must therefore act.	1.052534743433427
I should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another European region affected by immigration - the Canary Islands.	1.3526236950149353
Firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors.	0.8139653928955641
Secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration.	0.9947646617350543
Thirdly we are carrying out education programmes on tolerance and respect.	0.7385175423679873
Finally we are producing a census of immigrants.	0.6851816742901169
I hope that these measures will help towards ensuring compliance with the Tampere Agreements on immigration and the new Spanish Act on aliens. In particular they must ensure that people arriving in Europe do not lose their dignity.	1.3783423080990118
Mr President, last week, in the Andalusian town of El Ejido, we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the European Union in the year 2000.	1.460444984085048
This was acknowledged by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, on 9 February when he confirmed that what had occurred in El Ejido went against the very principles of the European Union.	1.3471024892478658
These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism, xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated.	0.9386507958274342
It is incomprehensible that ways of coexisting and ensuring mutual respect cannot be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial.	0.945221153254273
The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities.	1.4750096128210275
We are all immigrants.	1.0737677721079404
For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated.	0.9336280288975101
Geographical mobility is not an invention of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work-related causes.	1.0663681606331477
We are all immigrants, if not ourselves personally, then through one of our relations or ancestors.	1.6580085128313828
However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment.	1.3231614923999941
What happened in El Ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the European Union.	0.9885526207140265
We must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area. A whole community should not have been held responsible, criminalised and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident.	1.217576207994563
Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately. Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism.	1.3775371248187125
In particular, local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia, especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property.	1.2645976444416622
These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these, as has happened with the mayor in question.	1.2776702851909372
Thirdly, the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials. They must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union.	1.2319135064322404
Finally, the European Union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles.	1.4436407496396764
It must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstrations in its territory and support and collaborate with national, regional and local authorities and non-governmental organisations and associations in the application of these principles. This must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrants resident in the EU.	1.1639018526111269
Mr President, initially our Group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon.	1.2513893663318825
However, the incidents in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout Europe and which deserves our full attention.	1.1982640130955766
We thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in Europe. Yet, over the years, social disintegration in Europe has been combining with an increase in migration from surrounding countries and increased awareness of human rights to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance.	1.2103427191400251
This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider' s.	1.2100221028202858
This House therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures encompassing all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately. We must ensure respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues.	1.1930945802798623
In this respect we must not forget that the original victim' s attacker was suffering from a mental illness for which he had been inadequately treated.	1.093345561157531
The current difficulties must also be taken into account so that this town can adopt the necessary measures, as indicated previously.	1.3272200482355054
Finally, as our Nobel Prize Winner, José Saramago, has said, we are all in each other and as Jesus Christ said, although Saramago disagreed with this, we should not just love one another, more importantly, we should respect one another.	1.5487732782641672
Mr President, Commissioner, Andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the European Union.	1.040973426846792
Since time immemorial it has welcomed all those who have decided to move there and regarded them as Andalusians from day one, whether or not they were born in our region. Therefore, as an MEP, but primarily as an Andalusian, I can feel only sadness, repugnance and condemnation for the xenophobic and racist events which have occurred and which are foreign to this tolerant community.	1.2272653963145548
Yet a worrying situation is apparent.	0.6824576786583277
All decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the Community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like Andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents. I am referring, for example, to the lack of agreement with Morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry, part of whose fleet is moored in Almería.	1.220304858589409
I am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and vegetables by the EU which is dominating relations between Almería and Morocco. I am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions, Member States and European Union which, due to actions or omissions, is leading to a few territories like Almería having to support this migratory pressure from north-west Africa on their own.	1.2727540469101872
All these factors have unfortunately been accumulating over time and are now allowing those who are cruel, intolerant, racist and destructive, of which all our countries have some examples, but thankfully a minority, to light the fuse of xenophobia.	1.2773822226621057
Anyone, whether European or not, who lives and works in Andalusia, is an Andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect. The EU can and must speak out.	1.4932683415467396
For you, the south is Andalusia but for us Andalusians it is Africa.	1.1506037082724798
We must therefore ensure that the EU provides every possible resource so that the economy of the south can prosper and enable a society to develop with more tolerance and respect for one another. This has not been achieved with the solutions proposed to date which have quite simply been based on looking the other way.	1.3836378173627664
Mr President, Commissioner, I speak from experience acquired during many visits to El Ejido over the years. I was therefore aware how the situation was developing.	1.3580820044029003
Here in the European Parliament, as in many other institutions, we have watched this situation with concern and were beside ourselves when we heard what had happened. This is because we felt the problem to be ours, as it was.	1.482068331689962
In El Ejido there is a serious social problem, problems of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which acted as the detonator.	1.300333844041663
These events have also acted as a wake-up call to our consciences.	0.9207291559791547
Here in this House, in Spain and in many other countries, we have all fixed on El Ejido. Yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening, not only in El Ejido, but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment.	1.3852961541514903
We all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward. We will not find the guilty parties in this House or in many other places.	1.4941199804936178
Those responsible for what happened in El Ejido are a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrants. We must bear in mind that vengeance is not a solution.	1.1976845023673435
These problems can only be solved by close cooperation between all the authorities in order to achieve social integration and respect for all working there. This therefore requires a determined fight against illegal immigration and profound respect for the rights of immigrant workers who are legally working in El Ejido and throughout Europe.	1.2175944777464842
Mr President, this resolution expresses solidarity with the democratic forces in Spain fighting for human rights.	1.2384347576889423
All the Spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support.	1.142326111122438
It was not only immigrants who were the victims of atrocities; the democratic system in Spain has been held up to ridicule, despite having demonstrated its tremendous capacity to evolve over the last 20 years.	1.193467026490795
Employers would be lost without immigrants.	0.7734834678058923
Working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no Spaniard will accept them.	0.9106981099649258
Low wages, the lack of housing - some are living in cardboard huts - the lack of access to social services and the de facto system of apartheid are abominable and unacceptable and are not worthy of the respect which every human being deserves.	1.190661664114999
What happened at El Ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in Europe today.	0.9503499182986503
For four days, the immigrants were collectively hounded.	1.0103393999563828
Women and children were beaten.	0.7427870459650529
Fleeing from all quarters, hundreds of immigrants took refuge on a hill on the outskirts of the town.	0.8503039653010477
We are right to blacklist Haider' s Austria; but we cannot allow little local Haiders to practice policies of racial exclusion and merciless economic domination.	1.038635714141456
What happened in Spain could happen in any country in the Union if we are not careful.	1.3636503624807528
We all have a duty to put our own house in order.	0.6915286878161596
I support this proposal for a resolution, especially the points which refer to the application of Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, and point 11 of this resolution establishing a link between the Structural Funds allocated and the fight against exclusion.	1.2679496457018866
It would be to our credit were the European Parliament to roundly condemn these events and support all proposals tabled in order to ensure that the rights of immigrants in Spain and throughout the Union are respected.	1.3786341765120618
Mr President, acts of racist and xenophobic violence are taking hold at the heart of Europe.	1.1536888060793102
Everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements.	0.7007358705533812
We must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature.	1.0769924049401731
No European society can truly flourish when it harbours the risk of seeing one section of its population fall prey to the hatred of the other.	0.9779300085717795
Having received a delegation from the Austrian human rights association here yesterday and having seen what has happened in the province of Almería, it is easy to understand that we could easily have prevented this resurgence of racist hatred.	1.1770751914609283
These violent scenes at El Ejido are so similar to archive pictures of Alabama in the 1950s, when the KKK terrified the black population, that it is hard to tell them apart. They also put us in mind of Germany in the 1930s, when the Nazis were persecuting the Jews.	1.1844705351761458
Without wishing to lump everything together hysterically, because each period is different, we have failed to learn the lessons of history.	1.2484343876659072
That is my conclusion today.	0.9726412799304628
Because this witch hunt which broke out in the province of Almería should have been foreseen.	0.8527921761040991
It is the result, first and foremost, of the ghettoisation and exploitation of immigrant labour.	1.338370555570813
Three annual crops of Moroccan and African workers support 100 000 people and manage to bring in an annual turnover of nearly EUR 2 million; and yet 60% of them have no running water in a region where, as we know, the temperature may reach 40 degrees in summer.	1.2337780107880145
We also know that many of them only earn EUR 30 a month, while their fellow European citizens can earn three times that.	1.1017925089069744
This precarious wage-earning position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable.	0.8493751574178128
The irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion.	0.9862029250835395
We should counter such acts of terror, Mr President, by setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in preventing other conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere. My fellow Member, Mrs Roure, was right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order.	1.3006055243528372
Finally, and I think this is important: why not have the honesty today to relay what was disclosed in a recent UN study explaining that, if Spain wishes to preserve its work, retirement and pension potential, it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year 2050?	1.296522403555723
We must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember, to recall the dates in history when our countries teetered on the brink of horror.	1.210010650623861
We need to educate our children on these matters and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepared to accept many more immigrants in years to come.	1.1448687405840103
It just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday.	0.9213652845742805
We must take to the streets of Europe to protest against these alliances with extremists which are a disgrace to Europe and which lead our youth astray.	1.1537187167428071
Mr President, since the signature of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has had responsibility for combating racism and xenophobia.	1.417741552271364
Two types of measure are required for this purpose. The first should seek the integration of people of non-European origin and the other should aim to organise immigration.	1.301628807100693
With regard to the first, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and an action plan, which aim to apply the following decision taken by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere. This states that 'The European Union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its Member States.	1.3786338973248213
A more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens' . This is totally contrary to what we have seen and found recently in El Ejido where there are irregularities, labour exploitation and indecent living conditions, which have been condemned in the past.	1.334554418405366
I hope for prompt implementation of the measures to achieve integration. I also hope that the governments which produced such wonderful words in Tampere, including Spain, will work diligently to apply these.	1.3927043549906502
I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement made by the Council on immigration.	1.4262326894095403
The only proposal which has been made is for the directive on family reunification. This is a key issue, as we have seen recently in the media that there are many men on their own in El Ejido.	1.5089500347246494
Yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments. Outside the Community arena, some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies.	1.3071180177168702
This is occurring in my country, despite the government, the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens.	1.360509331525206
The objective of combating racism and xenophobia, explained in the Treaties, should be the objective of all European institutions and politicians.	1.2931377988448887
On 28 February 1998 the European political parties, including the Spanish Popular Party, signed the Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society.	1.2748881247325132
This requires coherent behaviour, yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out.	1.0142928558447093
The party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belongs should, according to the commitments signed in this Charter, act forcefully.	1.0236929567757478
It is only, as stated by Mr Hernández Mollar, through unity, responsibility and firmness that El Ejido, Spain and Europe will be able to overcome these events of which we are deeply ashamed.	1.3194923095562825
Mr President, one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of lynching, no less, of Moroccan day labourers which took place in El Ejido.	1.2986552451627071
We do not the extent to which far-right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame.	1.1294929522323114
We wish to assure these Moroccan workers that they have our full support - as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough, they have to suffer this type of aggression.	1.3012905970872468
And if the aggressors include working-class people, all we can say to them is that, in acting in this way, they are digging their own graves.	1.2599689011825568
In waging war against people who are as poor as they are, they are only doing their own exploiters a favour and preparing a future of oppression for themselves.	1.0931751450549978
But there are some who bear even more responsibility than the thugs who wielded the iron bars and knives: those who spread racist and xenophobic slander, those who indulge in anti-immigration demagoguery in Spain, Austria, France or elsewhere, sometimes even here in this House, are no better than those who take this stupid, reactionary demagoguery at face value.	1.1520931410192428
The lynch mob and their extreme right-wing mentors are the mortal enemies not only of the workers, but of society as a whole.	1.06576193038451
. I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Member on the way in which he introduced this extremely important debate.	1.1703548342931196
I want to make it clear at the outset that the Commission unreservedly condemns the dreadful acts of violence at El Ejido against the immigrant workers of the region.	1.2390080617736148
We express our support for the families and friends of the victims.	1.0057338374350135
President Prodi and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements.	0.8634153311409469
Naturally I completely endorse what they have said.	0.8299688755514935
It was especially moving to hear the remarks from Members of Parliament who come from the region about what has happened, uncharacteristically, in a part of Spain that I know reasonably well.	1.3235785767060515
Racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our Community, wherever they take place.	0.8766872618821437
They fly in the face of the very principles on which - as Mr Havel said yesterday - the European Union was founded: principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights.	1.2665592101115979
Of course progress has been made in recent years but we still have to work together towards a climate of tolerance in which racism and xenophobia are regarded as completely beyond the pale, completely unacceptable, while at the same time we deal very robustly with incidents such as the ones we are discussing this afternoon.	1.2602797279001654
We need, in our judgement, to focus on a package of measures including: first, the introduction of effective, anti-discrimination legislation at Union level; second, implementation of a common immigration policy with regard to the nationals of non-Member States to promote, in practical terms, the integration of the immigrant population in Member States' societies; third, the introduction of measures to combat social exclusion.	1.35785878177318
The European Union has already laid the basis for Community legislation on combating discrimination on the grounds of race.	1.3748457511912597
The insertion of Article 13, which was referred to during the debate, dealing with non-discrimination in the Treaty establishing the European Community, is one of the most significant changes of the last revision of the Treaties.	1.257752852428803
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force the Commission has presented a package of proposals for the implementation of Article 13 including, in particular, a proposal for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment regardless of race or ethnic origin.	1.272264012372253
This proposal is under examination by the Council and the European Parliament.	1.2759009541644868
The Commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete.	0.8884003764754589
The conclusions of the Tampere special European Council, as Mr Hernandez Mollar said, clearly illustrated the will of the Heads of State and Government as regards the introduction of a common policy on immigration and the principles on which it should be based, with particular emphasis on the Union' s policy on the respect and promotion of the rights of migrants.	1.398930199373448
At Tampere the Heads of State and Government also emphasised the importance of approximating national legislation on conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals based on a shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments in the Member States as well as the situation in the countries of origin.	1.2019609628851151
The European Council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration.	1.117911881948947
Its objective here is to secure the rights of victims of criminal networks organising illegal immigration, with particular reference to the rights of women and children.	1.1570623566637708
Those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour.	0.8104934861319394
The word that is used about them in Chinese society is 'snake-heads' . It seems to me a fitting description of them.	1.1662921497105734
Let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a European Union charter on fundamental rights, which has now reached the drafting stage.	1.422557711705806
Those rights are, by definition, universal.	1.0506261320176824
The charter will extend to third country nationals in Member States even though certain rights will be reserved to nationals of Member States of the Union.	0.9256335965906993
The El Ejido incidents were shocking, as several Members have said in their speeches.	1.1785369262489407
But trying to take something positive from them, I hope they will spur us on to translate our aspirations about tolerance, fairness and freedom into real and effective policies that will help to transform the lives of all those families and individuals in the European Union who cry out for our understanding and our help and who deserve it, not at some indefinite moment in the future, but here today.	1.2875326316910138
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The joint debate is closed.	0.43141497917890276
The vote will take place at 6 p.m.	0.6891275852876022

Mr President, before we start the debate on Kosovo or Mitrovica, I must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me.	1.3377432306876338
Indeed, it is not the first time that we will be debating Kosovo here.	1.4654852397688385
We have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot, as nothing is actually done with them.	1.3010420622144634
I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attends.	1.2996890401756085
I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten is present, given his powers.	1.299728302327374
But I - and many Members with me - also have to note that the Council is consistently absent from this debate.	1.4954695594367597
We need to cooperate with the Council too.	1.2322865894013162
I see that a diplomat from the Council is present who is diligently taking notes and who will then report to the Council but, for the rest, nothing will get done.	1.4494368004573595
I would insist on changing our procedures and on the fact that the Council should be present during the topical debate, so that we can enter into direct consultation with the Council.	1.1492148527816792
I think we should give this some thought.	1.1058959175186436
I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament.	0.9287714524972995
Mr President, Commissioner, we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons.	1.2827718482485655
First, because Mr Sakellariou, who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote, vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender.	1.2901305484014032
I have no doubt, and I am sure that you have no doubt, that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance.	1.3662871132122623
The other reason is that this text does not, unfortunately, go very far.	1.1728664090497203
I think that it manages, through a series of clever devices, to carefully avoid addressing the central issue, i.e. the final status of Kosovo.	1.260038218899261
I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia.	1.0069667500891284
I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of Kosovo.	0.9425411177581682
I also doubt that any of you think that, as things stand, it is not in Milosevic' s interest to pull out all the stops and destabilise Kosovo, as he is doing and as we have seen.	1.4534620426891298
Finally, I do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to Kosovo.	1.2431498523870637
I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution, which you no doubt overlooked.	1.1887550585309548
You condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troops.	0.793665829984364
I would not want you to be birds of ill omen, but I fear that, by failing to confront the real issue, you will end up being just that and I shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen.	1.4655373035641681
On the contrary, I think it is our duty to call on the Commission and the Council, which unfortunately is not present, to insist that the United Nations consider the question of the final status of Kosovo, of the multiplicity of micro-states in the region, of what happens post-Dayton and, finally, the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be built up in these countries and give the European Union a policy in this region.	1.4502654882925512
Finally, I would stress that we have been asking the Council and the Commission since July to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 Kosovar prisoners and Mrs Brovina, Mr Jurti and Mr Hoti.	1.396493814808301
I note that the Union is preparing to lift certain sanctions and that we have not seen even one of these prisoners released in exchange.	1.4737725946780864
Why not?	-0.0
Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible.	1.3703147058418266
Violence begets violence, and revenge begets revenge.	1.0225019398352526
The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on.	1.1296152838197462
The Chief Commissioner of Police, Svend Frederiksen, has expressed his desperation at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed.	1.1239539706970207
He has fewer than 2 000 officers, and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000.	1.2637292996899654
The police force should be large enough for it to be a visible presence, so that people can believe that it is in a position to stop atrocities. It should also be large enough to be able to clear up crimes and punish those who are guilty of them.	1.3171070898696622
Otherwise, there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands. It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained, and the idea was, in fact, that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained.	1.4189354546699855
However, there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime. A year ago, we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up.	1.4083196622820293
I was in Kosovo on 27 October 1998 when the Serbs withdrew.	1.0243403009945449
The agreement was that 1 800 OSCE observers should arrive to guarantee the peace.	0.9346276692401528
After a month, however, there was still only a handful of observers.	1.132907142698609
By Christmas, there were perhaps 100 and, by the spring, still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was, in fact, in place.	1.443688362738687
Atrocities were not even being recorded.	0.7550668418607555
Then the war came, and the observers were withdrawn.	1.2815108741717578
I would therefore ask the Commissioner: can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in Europe?	1.245807668135535
Can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers, who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad?	1.1042992625426016
I might also ask: when do you anticipate that they will be in place?	1.1561562521972917
And when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities?	0.9460334203013876
I mention this last issue because it is the solution we should be embracing as quickly as possible if peace is to have any chance at all.	1.2755145347012184
All who are in contact with real life in Kosovo share the same opinion: it is a tragic, desperate situation where there is a democratic void and no possibility of the different ethnic groups living peacefully side by side. Mitrovica is a tragic example of this.	1.2890972349078218
Before military intervention by NATO, Milosevic' s policy for Kosovo was certainly to be condemned, and the demands of the non-violent forces of the Rugovo era for the Kosovar regions to be autonomous were justified.	1.2024728932882829
But NATO' s decision for military intervention and the KLA' s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced Kosovo to a colony, as well as destroying civil infrastructures in Serbia.	1.0879681073130367
Today, Kosovo has no adequate strategy for protecting minority groups, and these include not only Serbs and Roma, but also moderate Albanians who still believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and are persecuted by the extremists in power.	1.2420184194943935
It is useless to talk of the Roma houses which have been burnt down and the thousands upon thousands of new refugees and the refugees from Krajina, who are now living, barricaded in, in Kosovo, abandoned by the UNHCR, which itself has been abandoned by the donors, while the emergency is still of dramatic proportions.	1.243953262496973
In the joint resolution, we ask the Council and the Member States to double their efforts to ensure respect for minority groups and to work towards the creation of democratic structures, giving a voice to all those forces which still believe in peaceful coexistence.	1.3416944329903109
In this sense, I am in agreement with Mr Sakellariou' s proposals.	1.3005474747753418
Another subject being discussed is the release of the Albanians held in prisons, particularly Flora Brovina, a woman of extraordinary humanity whom I met, together with the Women in Black of Belgrade, during joint attempts to build bridges between women from different ethnic groups.	1.1892099837895553
Flora defended herself, and asked Serbs and Albanians to shake hands.	1.0743150651758924
Flora Brovina' s husband is the guest of Serbian women in Belgrade.	0.7442650716138914
This is a sign of hope, the hope that it possible to act differently even in Serbia.	1.434415395387229
It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned.	1.253584530454419
She might well have been abandoned by the large institutions, but we, who worked in Kosovo and Serbia for many years, are doing our utmost to campaign for her release.	1.4786264752019393
I believe that the European Union must do likewise.	1.5146584603372129
The embargo on Serbia must be lifted and Serbia must, in turn, release its political prisoners.	1.064629766199336
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fully endorse Mrs Pack' s very emotionally-charged contribution.	0.9658559297332705
What she has said here is completely justified.	0.8606447835078486
There is not one truth in Kosovo, there are several.	1.4120042125997097
I refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that is bending the truth.	1.396048311228994
I completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us.	0.8745669898697441
We condemn all violence over there and that is what we need to do, but we cannot talk about genocide in reverse.	1.3211036975250279
Needless to say, the situation in Mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why.	1.267055935006992
There are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the Trepca mines also plays its part.	1.049445097269469
We have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners.	1.172047897503535
There is a great deal of pain, a lot of suffering in Kosovo.	1.2615948342614003
The people are holding demonstrations, they are sending us e-mails.	1.0952832433298227
They ask us where their children are, their sons.	1.0975608522659035
We need to be able to go back with a proper answer.	1.1759642195202553
The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many.	0.9971241638561221
We are right to include this in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds, even thousands of Flora Brovinas out there.	1.3321385738542908
I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners.	1.3697139080509495
The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo.	1.0571026622336428
Mr President, in the present joint draft resolution, paragraph 10 urges the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the UN police units.	1.5228895346079658
This request is fully in line with the vision held by the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo, Mr Bernard Kouchner.	1.1509810471515431
In order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo, he needs, by his own reckoning, at least 6 000 foreign police officers.	1.3201983574890563
The UN, however, have pledged to dispatch a police force of 4 800.	1.1258747512325638
To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal.	1.168911258394321
Moreover, half of this group is from the United States and Germany.	1.4991104641092363
It is logical that the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation, especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region.	1.1153170818131355
What is disconcerting, however, is Mr Kouchner' s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days.	1.1070917183476912
Paris is leaving its fellow-countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen, not more than 37, in the crisis region.	1.2619358560273701
For this hardly honourable position, Mr Kouchner blames none other than the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Chevènement.	1.3454491326090257
According to Mr Kouchner, the Minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the French police officials on ideological grounds.	1.2597480123749303
I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome.	1.3527734501620454
Press freedom in Angola	0.3160552155278532
Mr President, I do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity.	1.0241562520423029
On the question of Angola, I think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last.	1.372598471950546
It would be the first in a long time.	1.2680632284357432
So I welcome it as such.	0.7500071844800884
I think that the European Union and the western world in general has had Mr Savimbi in their crossfire for some time now, with no discrimination whatsoever, but corruption is now so rife in Mr Dos Santos' s regime that even his long-standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything.	1.2130359182588597
So I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter, especially the worrying things which we are discussing, particularly logistics support for the information services by the United States and Great Britain, generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely 'spicy' matters which we need to go into.	1.3899479490472988
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the European Union.	1.2468215649338945
Clearly, governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial, geostrategic or economic interests.	0.9972591753103872
We have established requirements for the countries which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support, because we believe in democracy and its values.	1.4313766954173823
A free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy.	0.8598585299746027
There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion.	0.904536711469334
Yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted, detained, threatened or put under pressure.	0.8663461696687308
We rightfully condemned the behaviour of UNITA which threatened the peace process in Angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace. Rightfully and with the full weight of our authority, we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the Government of Angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society.	1.2458969920715344
Mr President, how much longer can we continue our cooperation with Angola?	1.3593666184404
Human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time, not only by UNITA, but also by the government itself.	1.4051525412022638
The legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle.	0.9172034845470763
The Angolan Government must immediately authorise a substantial UN presence which can mediate and can report on human rights.	0.890658689806
Additionally, European observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists.	1.1924483097134124
Europe, as a major donor, has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola.	1.431680578723486
If the Angolan Government continues to refuse to cooperate, measures will need to be taken.	1.0355495061733455
Without national reconciliation, reconciliation with Europe is not possible.	1.1014128737497775
This being the case, Angola will unfortunately remain a very rough diamond.	0.8287571552469071
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this House. The repression of both Angolan and foreign journalists in Angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment.	1.1804907563958946
However, this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that Angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them.	1.3384470285989476
Yet this is not the situation.	1.1376453595937523
Angola does not enjoy rule of law. It is a repressive dictatorship.	1.3340602224012967
It is at war, and a bloody war at that, which is dragging on and on.	1.5815996368592362
The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept.	1.1726402277678682
The repeated appeals made by the Angolan church and, for example, by Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki, for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this House.	1.3114634946734987
As another Member said, we must have a general debate on Angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country.	1.3262521707232362
For example, I have today received information directly from Rafael Marques, whose situation we are discussing, according to which two correspondents from Portuguese television have been imprisoned in Angola.	1.2341526229447402
These cases keep occurring.	0.44096288514773035
Yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in Angola.	1.2182695698587498
The silence of the major powers and our own silence are questionable and are benefiting a regime of corruption, violence and war.	1.0183242561454293
I must draw attention to the fact that the war in Angola is spreading to other parts of Africa.	1.1842086332105608
It is impacting on the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the situations in Namibia and Zambia. It is now also affecting the situation in Zimbabwe where Robert Mugabe has just lost the referendum precisely because he has sent troops to the Congo to prop up Laurent Kabila who is beyond salvation.	1.085066180694818
There are two sides in Angola or rather two armed groups.	1.0276662202079838
The first is the MPLA, which controls the oil profits. The second is the armed band of Mr Savimbi, which controls the diamond profits.	1.3554347763138237
It is oil and diamonds which are financing the continuation of the war which, as has been said, is terrible. It has displaced millions of people and caused them to go hungry.	1.398646140385097
It has led to a critical and tragic situation in Angola.	0.7176647880870445
This war must be stopped.	0.7033900988649128
The authority of this House could play an important part if we were to have a major debate on the Angolan situation and also on the whole of southern Africa.	1.5771231612970797
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom. It is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes.	1.2610054326360687
The problem considered by the motion is a major one but, as has already been touched upon, could be regarded as minor in light of the even greater problem of the general situation in Angola which is experiencing a terrible humanitarian disaster.	1.2995889065519843
This situation, as in neighbouring former Zaire, is like a festering wound in which it is not clear who is infecting whom. As Mr Soares just said, a truly terrible situation is developing in Angola and in other countries in the region.	1.4933283189967494
This was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the First World War of Africa, given the involvement of certain countries in others.	1.1729779196562364
This is a major issue because the Angolan State and authorities must assume their responsibilities. The international community and the European Union must spell this out very clearly.	1.4453622216185669
These journalists are professionals who are trying to inform the public in their country and denounce the corruption existing in this regime, for which they are being persecuted.	1.2993417138993395
It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola.	1.2219704873538872
We have experienced this in our own national and European history. People can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant.	1.2264495074779578
The cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace, although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible.	1.3259732865401863
Like a previous speaker, I also fully support the appeals which have been made.	1.4309229598941642
We must, some time soon, find the courage to tackle the whole Angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously.	1.0975325350384157
In recent years, the behaviour of UNITA has merited our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the Angolan State for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people.	1.0319529547439343
We must establish dialogue with other forces in Angola, be attentive to the appeals of the Angolan church and encourage the emergence of other national institutions, national reconciliation and new cultural and political forces not engaged in war. These can then eventually free this country and this people from the armed fate which they have been experiencing for decades.	1.1801598142839078
The people of Angola deserve better.	0.9376555907294645
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems as if the world is turned upside down.	1.1187228534644915
Journalists are sent to prison for simply speaking the truth, whilst soldiers who are supposedly fighting each other exchange smuggled goods in the bar in the evening.	0.9609462596015282
This is Angola' s reality.	0.6133111197905002
We are now expressing our horror concerning this war.	0.9709447832821171
Three million victims, two million driven from their homes within the country' s borders, hundreds of thousands driven away across its borders, including women and children.	1.0709556825734654
This is a war which transcends its borders. It is not just UNITA which is to blame.	1.5765146779269381
The government too is responsible for this continuing violence. This is why we insist that the journalists - more than 20 were imprisoned last year - keep speaking their minds.	1.2851450395224882
We would, at the same time, like to insist on other things.	1.023050233968889
We want the UN embargo, which is supposed to prevent a large proportion of arms and ammunition from being flown across to UNITA airports, to stop.	1.3621924170182065
But what do these sanctions mean?	0.716510536353834
It is the western world itself which is partly to blame.	1.1550720459650556
It is we, our own people, who keep the war going over there.	1.431406834550589
The so-called civilised world should hang its head in shame.	0.701948590768531
This is also the case for the so-called statutory government which is just as guilty, because if this journalist has accused the President himself of deriving benefit from this civil war, then all he is doing is voicing what the entire world knows already and which is being passed on to every tribal district across Africa.	1.2575564104014407
Mr President, we are partly to blame for this war.	1.3714017371770857
We should stop financing this regime and we should certainly stop supplying arms for the war.	1.0814961562845138
Mr President, the facts are well-known.	1.2858821277587733
On 24 December, the Angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the Portuguese paper, Expresso, to a year' s imprisonment and a fine of USD 20 000.	1.273470063623936
The journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the President' s cabinet.	0.8072556254395971
The trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness.	0.8146813236125172
Another journalist was threatened with his life during a parliamentary debate last month by a member of parliament of the MPLA government party.	1.0979388619358517
These are only two examples of a trend in Angola to silence any government critics.	0.8783756929926698
Over the past year, more than twenty journalists have been arrested for alleged slander or criminal offences against state security.	1.10173291717724
Their only crime was to criticise what human rights organisations have been denouncing all along, namely the large-scale corruption and disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars, paid by the oil companies to the Angolan Government.	1.0616425133562197
Even the British Minister, Peter Hain, conceded this recently. We should ensure that the oil revenue is not used merely to finance the war or to line the pockets of prominent members of government, he told President Dos Santos last month.	1.152792827494914
But, at the same time, we note that Great Britain and also Portugal are continuing to channel military aid to the government.	1.079451125311098
There is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding Angola.	1.022986856125631
On the basis of a report, the human rights organisation Global Witness concluded that the western world is turning a blind eye to the activities of Dos Santos because it is fishing for lucrative oil contracts.	1.1403280926554935
I would like to challenge Portugal to deliver proof to the contrary, by making commercial interests subservient to human rights, to which so much lip service is being paid.	1.408776494491634
In my opinion, Angola is a test case.	0.9302308467963442
We should, at any rate, judge the Portuguese Presidency on its actions and not on its words.	1.1501842196521221
Native Americans in the US - Dineh	0.8698520310746222
Mr President, the American leaders do not seem to have learnt a great deal from the criticism of how they treated the Indians and other indigenous peoples.	1.1595251016265489
We have to admit that our European sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect.	1.3087848047878579
Once again, an indigenous people' s right of existence is being threatened.	1.1152870172208833
Once again, the individuality, dignity and health of a people are being sacrificed to the higher economic interest.	1.1040031158408936
Once again, we are losing a piece of our planet' s cultural and ecological heritage, despite the many treaties and resolutions on human rights, on the protection of minorities, rights of indigenous peoples, etc., which have already been ratified.	1.328220707415042
If tradition and culture have to make way for economic imperatives at all, we should at least give sufficient attention to the reception and reintegration of the peoples concerned.	1.3048592871747762
But if we are to believe the environmental movements, even this is vain hope.	1.333044684471972
There are hardly any reintegration programmes for people who have been relocated to the so-called New Lands.	0.8949291784937234
It very much remains to be seen whether these New Lands will be safe in terms of public health.	0.981589205477951
It is of key importance that the American authorities provide greater clarity regarding the way in which they are trying to offer these families a dignified alternative in keeping with a traditional way of life.	1.0488682660679514
It is also important that a debate is held where the long-term effects of mining in this region are discussed and weighed up in economic, ecological and social terms.	1.2290488115839016
The credibility of the industrialised north is at stake.	0.7088246472154672
Indeed, what right do we have to demand of developing countries that they give their minorities a voice, that they protect their valuable natural areas and that they respect human rights, if it transpires that we are unable to meet these demands in our own countries?	1.4912624964649188
Mr President, as Mr Van Hecke rightly pointed out, this is about human rights and about the rights of indigenous peoples, and Parliament must speak up, especially vis-à-vis good friends, and the United States is a good friend.	1.6143335747657694
This is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time.	1.0727406133124586
It is up to the European Parliament to protect vulnerable people.	1.2683019402010325
So we need to do this.	1.0990589295997684
This is also about respecting a culture, a language, a way of life and a people' s religion, a vulnerable culture which has nearly disappeared.	1.5215699525593214
It is important to point this out.	1.0457478904437858
This is why it is necessary - and Mr Van Hecke has already mentioned this, and this is also what we clearly ask for in our resolution - that the role of mining in this vulnerable desert area is reassessed.	1.4801581075682413
We have just approved the water directive here in Parliament.	1.1066237068957459
The water which these people need to exist is under threat because the groundwater strata there are being drilled by a mining company, and this is why the traditional way of life of the people who live there is being threatened.	1.1998867555703343
The forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally.	0.7995884965694195
People should no longer be forced to move.	0.8908317332292247
Over the past 25 years, no less than 25 000 people have been forced to move and this must stop.	1.2955456550816355
If people need to move at all, they need to be given a viable alternative.	1.2665148385073115
This is not the case here.	1.1426798506138156
The area where the people in question are now being taken - and this is also the reason for this resolution - is a polluted area which is economically not suitable.	1.483326492938788
This is why I think that we as European Parliament need to ask the American authorities in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and, if necessary, abandon the scheme altogether.	1.3476288023106477
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my maiden speech and I am delivering it with a great deal of pleasure and conviction as the topic is human rights.	1.2043212794873854
In terms of human rights, Europe has a very eventful past and this is why we have become to some extent the cradle of these human rights.	1.2797426036847983
We need to continue to stand up for these rights, especially in our own Member States and societies, but also elsewhere.	1.618586419782186
As Mr Sterckx said, we certainly need to do this vis-à-vis the United States which, after all, is close to us in terms of democratic values.	1.3987591214647337
The treatment of the Native Americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights.	1.1084903801662436
The account of the Dineh Indians is telling.	0.9128531278676351
With the discovery and, certainly, the exploitation of black gold - and, later on, uranium and oil - all possible means were used to remove these people from their land and to send them to regions with few prospects other than poverty, hardship and contamination.	1.2285058411625274
The area in Arizona which is to be the New Land for the Dineh Indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in US history.	1.1344675317280142
It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land.	1.1274970583640451
The fight of these Indians is being backed by more than 250 NGOs and, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian 'Mother Earth' organisation, we are being kept informed of this situation.	1.1722428663567224
This too is characteristic of American society, which hears little about it.	1.149472501634168
They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents, but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country.	1.0611888504510782
Today, the Dineh Indians are facing their final fight for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, for their right to their way of life.	1.1443448423412421
There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful, economic adversary.	1.1936267708868877
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers, but I would like to emphasise a few things.	1.3280129701109624
The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians.	1.0149360436243802
They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years.	0.8637104793912674
They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years.	0.8844198229073111
The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries.	1.1665333036244716
The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples.	1.1900920829571031
This relocation is, of course, unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic, social and cultural terms.	1.0713641167683463
The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and, in that way, lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their forefathers - but also any prospect of work and sources of income.	1.340372294883802
The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry.	0.881391592467738
Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives.	1.2037902206445876
The population was not allowed any input.	0.6954313076872595
This resembles a kind of trade in human beings.	0.8866216816753287
The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium.	0.9949346176229663
After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world' s most contaminated areas.	1.1678594066372199
The United States administration, the coal industry and all of us need to acquit ourselves of our responsibility and provide a sound alternative: either the soil is cleaned or the Dineh Indians are allocated a proper place where provision is made for all kinds of support, be it in the psychological, social, cultural or budgetary field.	1.1509295052772022
It is high time we respected the rights of the Indians.	1.0610799995842077
This is why we ask you to vote for this resolution: we in Europe should not be intimidated by American interests which are being pushed by financial, religious and industrial groups.	1.3295767391185391
So let us contact the United States now!	0.986009664945932
Madam President, despite the protests by the international press, we still do not know the fate of Mr Andrey Babitsky, the courageous Russian journalist who has worked intensively to ensure free and independent information on the ordeal of the civilian population of Chechnya and the destruction of the city of Grozny.	1.3048730101450519
Among the contradictions in the accounts that have been given, there has also been an attempt to reassure international public opinion over Mr Babitsky' s fate, by confirming the theory that there was an exchange of prisoners with Chechen fighters which, inter alia, if this did actually take place, would constitute a breach of international law, which certainly does not provide for the involvement of civilians in such circumstances.	1.3077238230509012
Nevertheless, we now have more precise information: we know that the acting Russian President himself, Mr Vladimir Putin, asked Russian special services to safeguard Andrey Babitsky' s life and freedom.	1.2813767382786834
This is an admission that confirms all our concerns and makes Parliament' s position on the case all the more appropriate, as it calls for a concurrent explanation of other cases of journalists who have disappeared in the Chechen region during the conflict and the safeguarding of media coverage of a conflict that has reached unacceptable levels of violence.	1.2049780294593229
Moreover, we are asking the Russian authorities to provide immediate clarification of conditions in the so-called detention centres, and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention, maltreatment or killing of civilians are laying themselves open to accusations of crimes against humanity.	1.1542620235925862
We would ask the Council and the Commission for clear and prompt action and a political initiative which does not overlook the issue of human rights.	1.1456137019494435
Mr President, in terms of human rights, there is of course a great deal amiss in Chechnya.	1.3965855410401782
We have received reports from human rights organisations saying that Russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - I am talking about old men and women - in Grozny.	1.297894539456023
Citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air-raid shelters.	0.9273409101324817
We insist that these violations of human rights are investigated.	0.9718379057927801
Despite the pledges made, violations in, for example, Alfanyurt have still not been investigated.	1.0355574429683816
International government organisations and non-governmental organisations must be allowed access, and the Union' s general Council decided on 6 December 1999 to send representatives from the Member States to Ingushetia to study the humanitarian situation there. I am, to say the least, curious to know how they are getting on.	1.4563114090868186
The fate of Andrey Babitsky, the correspondent in Grozny of Radio Liberty, who was arrested by Russian troops, is a dramatic example of Russian policy.	1.227975175900027
It contravenes Article 3 of the Geneva Convention of 1949 and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press.	1.056167397213146
We want information from the Russian authorities as to Mr Babitsky' s whereabouts and his state of health.	0.8846384101998988
Mr President, a journalist is on a fact-finding mission and this calls for freedom.	1.2206075477732916
Yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war.	0.7786367908937232
The war in Chechnya, like any war, is a trail of horrors.	1.369290268889545
The filtration camps are camps in which torture, rape and violations are perpetrated: we know that now.	0.9239063255037286
And just what is Mr CFSP doing?	0.8437700775149535
Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a full member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, it has been invited to G7 and is a client of the IMF and the World Bank.	1.3596244663561117
What are we doing about it?	0.773565047674608
I do not understand why the power centres of Europe are keeping quiet, letting things pass and, by working with the Russians as if nothing were amiss, giving its support to the government which is waging this war.	1.3065194024684652
I beg you to intervene.	0.5775198627602637
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic case of the courageous Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky illustrates once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which Russia has sunk.	0.9859864846121185
The entire Federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda.	1.0963366081364079
A warlord has become President and he has even been described as a reformer in some western quarters.	0.9215852854686135
Journalists, on the other hand, who are simply going about their work in Russia, i.e. endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible, are being treated like criminals.	1.2944268309024713
The Russian Government appears to have lost its fundamental understanding of what democracy is about and truth appears to have become a threat in its eyes.	1.0278205751751903
I can only reiterate my appeal to the Council and the Commission to stick to the rules.	1.236856438545149
It is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the EU if it does not recognise democratic principles.	1.1646601213797962
Mr President, what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as 'terrorists' and 'bandits' ?	1.2742682536747896
Without any hesitation, the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs, Vladimir Rushailo, earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question.	1.059318699831602
The victim of this exchange is said to be the 35-year-old war correspondent of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Andrey Babitsky.	0.9377977270774002
I am using the phrase 'is said to be' on purpose, because official Chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged Mr Babitsky for a number of Russian prisoners of war.	1.0920026491229222
In the meantime, the highest Russian authorities are casting a veil of secrecy over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist.	0.9884670204267829
For example, Acting President Vladimir Putin gave an assurance last Monday that he had ordered the country' s security services to bring the missing reporter back to Moscow safely.	1.0211661730769988
Russia' s new strong man, however, added a rather puzzling comment to this welcome declaration: 'As far as I am aware, Mr Babitsky already feels free.'	1.2213546627047347
This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising.	0.9869968836500022
The facts are clear.	0.6080168730679596
Andrey Babitsky was an unwanted busybody in Mr Putin' s 'anti-terrorist' operation in Chechnya.	0.8021709216402225
Hence his disappearance of over one month.	0.6289840955571228
In any case, the Babitsky affair warrants one conclusion: the leaders in Moscow cannot possibly maintain that hostage-taking and trading in defenceless citizens is a specifically Chechen crime.	0.9954923530140978
This resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the Chechen tragedy.	1.1244050023019683
Nor is it a mere luxury.	0.8219036687822774
Indeed, it is in line with some thirty Russian media bodies which yesterday distributed a special issue on Andrey Babitsky free of charge.	1.0814690732524495
Cambodia	-0.0
Mr President, Commissioner, it is because of my experience in the Balkans, when I was there on duty, that I call on you today to support the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to bring those responsible for the genocide in Cambodia to trial before an independent court under the aegis of the United Nations.	1.2803204431210098
I do not think that reconciliation is possible after such murderous tragedies, unless those responsible for starting them are brought to trial and sentenced.	1.1025562899383343
Nor do I think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial.	1.308873292578035
I became convinced of this in Sarajevo when I had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement, none of which unfortunately lasted, between the parties to the conflict.	1.0496002288556976
Every time, just as the exchange was about to take place, we found men missing from the meticulously drawn up lists.	1.2201612316039168
Every time, when we asked why, the reply was the same, 'We cannot release him: he is a war criminal' .	1.4841324894064032
In the emotion, pain and fury of the agreements, it was impossible to break the vicious circle of blood and vengeance.	0.9732610463609406
If we want to help the Cambodians with the task of reconciliation on which they have embarked, we need to try and sentence those responsible at the highest level and thus exonerate the simple underlings and all those who were willingly or forcibly dragged along behind them.	1.1882343804586866
I expect Ta Mok and his main lieutenants to be tried and sentenced by the establishment of a tribunal whose impartiality is guaranteed by the United Nations.	1.0215494428454819
This will be the only way for the Cambodians to pardon those who simply followed them and to achieve lasting peace.	1.3264559949015138
Mr President, it became known this week that two prominent Cambodian opposition papers have been threatened with closure because they are reported to have insulted the king and prime minister.	1.102785086496003
These papers actively support the opposition politician, Mr Sam Rengie.	1.113206971986172
Legal proceedings have been initiated against Sam Rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason.	1.0433648626948486
In his millennium speech, he dared to raise the fact that it should become clear what the procedure would be for appointing the successor to King Sihanouk in the event of his death.	1.3324715235475892
In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal.	1.1944241102470368
In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister.	1.2351389238861026
This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm.	0.8765393605693134
In October, a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid.	1.1262461756351658
The pattern of intimidation is clear.	0.5729167148982712
There is more going on in Cambodia: prisoners are being tortured, the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children, and people are held on remand to an excessive degree.	1.2454564116830271
All this is happening on a daily basis.	0.955981550694778
Even more serious is the government' s refusal to bring the leaders of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal.	0.9172431585075317
It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased.	1.1294441478067534
The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union' s relations with Cambodia.	1.393155898995923
Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected.	1.314230556959964
Living examples of this have been the Pinochet-Ugarten case, Kosovo and, in milder form in our own Union, the debate surrounding the government decision in Austria.	1.4710931047570008
This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice.	1.16412683553068
At the same time, the struggle against impunity is under threat.	0.8716644893243545
The situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow.	1.2230378641536017
. Mr President, we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday.	1.2616836029556235
I am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge.	1.5166675520276605
First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails.	1.4454717554126162
Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation.	1.3301812569290394
In particular we support the development of a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society.	1.2548151544596726
Our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and, in particular, to try to build confidence between the various communities.	1.36887933852202
We have always condemned ethnic violence, no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim.	1.131560959423216
We consider it is unacceptable against Serb and Roma minorities as it was against the Kosovar Albanians in the past.	1.1282414566189207
We support the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR and the OSCE to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order.	1.1599114589568016
In this regard we strongly support the High Representative' s recent appeal to Member States to provide more police officers for the UN civil police mission in Kosovo.	1.1431307529460641
It was a point raised by several speakers in the debate.	1.2994823936884563
I hope it will underline the importance, when we address the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy, of looking at the non-military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects.	1.3314749754327249
It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity.	1.0622623791334103
We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons.	1.1261780324540742
I totally agree with the points put so passionately by the Mrs Pack, either before trial or following judgement.	1.0242763451800405
The plight of Kosovar Albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing.	1.2118155183639967
We call on everyone, within and outside Kosovo, to support these common aims, to support UNMIK and KFOR in their efforts to achieve them.	1.4699540826298
Turning briefly to Angola, we had again a number of knowledgeable speeches, especially from Mr Soares, with his unrivalled knowledge of the subject.	1.3777045817573041
The Commission believes strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in Angola.	1.0737726952968651
It is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society.	1.0641062101460077
An area of special concern is the harassment of journalists, including temporary detention of members of the so-called independent press.	1.126800269281649
The European Union made a specific démarche on press freedom to the Angolan Ministry of Justice in November last year.	1.205341732594754
We fully support the work of the UN through UNUA, given its specific responsibility to monitor the human rights situation in Angola.	1.2430399671959558
We are also committed to the Security Council' s sanctions against UNITA, including arms controls.	1.45650619113636
While maintaining emphasis on humanitarian needs, the Commission is preparing for a post-conflict phase in our financial support for Angola.	1.1779570270569613
An essential element will be support for democracy and human rights, including specific initiatives to strengthen democratic institutions and civil society.	1.0604714169076086
The European Union has condemned the use of anti-personnel landmines and we are supporting de-mining operations through an international NGO.	1.2800420781675212
The resolution I would love to have a debate on in Parliament one day is on demining, and particularly the importance of destroying the stocks of existing mines: stocks in the Ukraine, stocks in Moldova and stocks elsewhere.	1.1295695976460538
This is a subject which is not given sufficient attention.	1.4650781486295217
On the question of the indigenous peoples in the US, I am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the US authorities will have been noted by them.	1.2674420643474884
Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America.	1.376644915236996
The Commission shares the growing concern about the missing Russian journalist, Mr Babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in Chechnya more generally.	1.137140854532453
This issue comes on top of our deep worries about the plight of the civilian population in Chechnya, and I have heard Mr Posselt on this subject before.	1.3263021967725404
There are alarming reports of human rights violations.	0.724678190917409
Of course, there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict.	1.265383720930282
The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a European Union Troika démarche on the eleventh of this month.	0.8989148960808396
We underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the Russians to clarify the circumstances of Mr Babitsky' s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights.	1.1067756115950478
We await a proper response from the Russians.	0.6540441635872878
In the meantime, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council earlier this week have confirmed the message which I have given today.	1.321277196459598
And we are ready to return to the issue at the EU-Russia Ministerial Troika in Lisbon on 2 March, if we need to do so.	1.4172414223660652
Finally, on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge: we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes.	1.2472461877180026
I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon.	1.0384059024311416
We vigorously supported the Troika démarche to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong on 4 February this year.	0.7196278193541017
The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders.	1.27992869727013
At the same time, we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties.	1.1227779553157784
I am encouraged by the optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal.	1.1276055485620924
The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year.	1.017575024893356
It has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days.	0.9323421493879802
I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead.	1.329163389193063
Thank you very much Commissioner Patten.	0.8949357156121014

Danube environmental disaster	-0.0
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	0.5970435025992148
B5-0164/2000 by Mr Leinen on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists,	0.7872758984768483
B5-0167/2000 by Mr Maaten and Mrs Thors on behalf of the Group of the European Democrat and Reform Party,	0.9904106114345451

B5-0173/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sjöstedt on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left,	0.8921070651186468
B5-0179/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance	0.8453211244391792
on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a Romanian goldmine into the Lepos, Somes, Tisza and Danube Rivers.	0.949300216255008
Mr President, we debated the framework directive on water this week, and the disaster in Romania has demonstrated once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water.	1.5135886670297376
This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union.	1.2498010172950975
We are delighted with the pledge that EU aid will be used to clean the rivers, and at least as important is the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in Romania and, more generally, in Central and Eastern Europe.	1.2655021199323224
We therefore welcome Commissioner Wallström' s brief visit, for it can contribute to this awareness.	1.2988253027404466
After all, this is a candidate country we are talking about, and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the EU environmental rules in time.	1.4531992550268238
The polluter ought to pay.	0.6157141134313001
I wonder whether the European Union can recoup this kind of cost from the environmental cowboys who appear in the so-called 'Wild East' , making use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place.	1.2697748456114664
I would be in favour of its doing so.	1.1019443035600713
Mr President, Commissioner, there has been one ecological disaster after another and, unfortunately, they are all similar.	1.2777817452684852
Once again, there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe.	0.9823428798014148
The delta of the Danube is in danger.	1.0964447183268016
As in Spain in April 1998, as in Brittany and the Vendée since last December, once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat.	1.2058937637631617
The European Parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger, which threatens our environment, upsets our ecosystem and again weakens our populations.	1.250272669806683
This new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries.	1.079148671069375
The authorities in these counties, which are still very frail from an environmental point of view, need to overcome numerous obstacles.	1.1657343226252892
First, they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites; then they need to have suitable technical means of curbing and containing this type of pollution and, finally, they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites.	1.281038608139409
Today, the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted, which is why the European Union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with Community environmental protection standards.	1.2709049054331218
But, over and above that, it is the technologies and the means used to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which are being called into question.	1.284333726624728
I hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility.	1.1376827756494863
The environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the European continent.	1.3895456603156653
It must form the basis for our partners' political will.	1.0446270702112763
Implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop, it will also have social and economic benefits and, at the same time, public health standards will improve.	1.3039027343808407
The efforts already being made need to be stepped up.	0.8987161145747184
The European continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the 'polluter pays' principle.	1.0283212116315241
Mr President, when the Doñana disaster occurred, the non-governmental organisation, the World Wide Fund for Nature, gave us a report on the number of reservoirs of this type in Europe.	1.4921121356833629
The number is huge. They are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply, ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas.	1.0529076814446854
I visited Doñana after the spill and saw how agriculture, fishing and the lives of people in the surrounding area were enormously compromised.	0.9469261258207925
I therefore believe that the European Union must, to start with, carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoirs and compile a precise record of the number of these in Europe.	1.392340177844579
We must bring these reservoirs under Community law and the directives on waste and we must use the precautionary principle to ensure that this type of event does not happen again.	1.2139925846080248
If we do not, we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent.	1.13879054739863
Mr President, this disaster at the mine in Romania affects a large hydrogeological area with rivers and watercourses in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria, The fact that 100 000 m3 of cyanide-poisoned water and large quantities of heavy metals have leaked out into the ecosystem is going to have appalling consequences for people in the area for a very long time to come, as well as for animal and plant life, agriculture, the tourist industry, biodiversity and the whole of the ecosystem.	1.23585235368814
It is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today.	1.097404670995894
Is a substance as poisonous as cyanide really to be used in the mining industry and in the production of metals?	0.9666664919929677
The answer, of course, is an emphatic no.	1.2155735031706312
There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide.	0.9864335270138305
I assume, therefore, that the EU will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total, worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance.	1.3325654419539241
It has already been banned in most EU countries for a long time now.	1.1119931209653064
That an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs.	1.0891661284703287
I have been informed that the Commissioner for the Environment, Margot Wallström, has travelled from Strasbourg to Romania in order to see for herself, on the spot, what has happened.	1.4562085293992284
My Group assumes that Margot Wallström will promise to provide aid to those communities which have been affected: economic aid, support in terms of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning-up operation which is required.	1.1289230396846033
This highlights the need for something which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been demanding for an extremely long time, namely a rapid reaction force offering protection to civilians in the event of major environmental and industrial catastrophes of this type.	1.2066816032634256
It also sheds light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant States.	1.0063343107001015
We must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people' s health and the ecosystems.	1.0122658277721124
Mr President, I do not think we are in a position to throw stones at the Eastern European countries which have come knocking at the door of the European Union, because ecological disasters occur as much here, in the west, as they do in the east.	1.5243866715939196
For example, the overflow from the decanting basins at the gold mines in Salsigne, in France, have caused tremendous pollution and are a huge economic disaster even today.	1.1678562889572188
We know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions.	0.7103860233089925
Who is going to pay?	0.5969241531391573
Which is why the environmental aspect, which is becoming a matter of urgency, must be taken into account in all development projects at all costs.	1.3776026697888513
I too should like to ask the European Union to put its own house in order here, i.e. to call on Member States which still have gold mines to commission expert reports, so that we know just what the situation is.	1.3193838572747603
I am thinking in particular of the gold mines in French Guiana, where the workers, who are generally women, are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions.	1.2057772464630399
. Let me associate myself, not least as a former Environment Minister, completely and without any reservation whatsoever, with the expressions of concern by honourable Members.	1.2526738424638517
An objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage.	1.0653622349570886
But early reports suggest that the poisoning of the Lepos, Tisza, Somes and Danube Rivers is a very serious environmental tragedy.	1.0576238698588862
It has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days.	0.9133457492316551
No living organisms, from microbes to otters, have been spared.	1.214557552083941
Several Members have set out what seems to have happened.	1.0270698877487148
We have all seen some of the consequences on our television screens.	1.2111965406014187
Some environmental experts have put the environmental consequences of this disaster, at least so far as damage to the ecosystem is concerned, on a par with Chernobyl.	1.3970904041179895
It has affected the peoples of three countries - Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia.	1.0865210665369325
It is the Tisza, Hungary' s second river, perhaps its most beautiful and most loved by its people, that has borne the brunt.	1.2956056754977365
As with all such disasters it is the long-term consequences that are the most pernicious.	1.3465464094125184
Some estimates suggest that it could take up to five years to restock the river.	1.0519154127275616
There is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish.	0.9339882153667585
We plainly have a responsibility to do everything we can, as rapidly as we can, to help cope with this catastrophe.	1.4696005048951197
That is certainly the view of my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, who I know would have wished to respond to this resolution in person today.	1.377580061713899
The reason she cannot do so is because, as some honourable Members have pointed out, she is in Hungary and Romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to tackle the crisis.	1.23309658693241
We stand ready to do so.	0.5156780127201374
We contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently.	1.1508258132615796
The Romanians have approached UNEF and OCHA, in Geneva, for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts.	1.2860221809283565
We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed. That is obviously crucial.	1.2296008327728238
It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it.	1.1272855865234286
It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged.	1.3395091978578166
There is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the Romanian authorities.	1.0091637234916173
This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested.	1.5104821983397227
The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy.	0.9552199321383095
It is mirrored in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be applied in this case.	1.4128022347715965
The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due.	1.1047846084902442
The Union has mobilised some EUR 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the Danube River basin.	1.186775798656209
In the context of pre-accession aid to the region it may be possible to redirect some of the assistance we are giving under ISPAR and PHARE to tackle the most severe impact of this accident, as long as the polluter-pays principle is fully respected.	1.2145266283188678
We will want, in the longer term, to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster, above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place.	1.41014913586675
The incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of European civil protection, along the lines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two Members today.	1.0806071101157502
But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis.	0.9095431713038239
As I have said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, is on the spot today.	1.253221848198009
She will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit.	1.0780540159167307
This has been an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future.	1.0643156093986248
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
We shall now proceed to the vote.	0.16783221255831815
VOTE	-0.0
.	-0.0
(FR) The only reason we voted for the PSE-Verts/ALE-GUE/NGL compromise motion for a resolution is because this resolution allowed us to condemn the decision by the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its factory in Italy.	1.0936478029816157
However, the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and exacerbating unemployment.	1.3983900903992434
Moreover, it is all just words, because the Socialist governments, which are now in a majority in Europe, are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right-wing governments.	1.5294262303459933
The real problem is not finding a legal way of slightly complicating redundancy procedures, but banning them.	1.166062162119903
The only way of stopping the diabolical machine which produces capital gains on the one side and unemployment on the other is to ban redundancies in all large companies which are in profit, on pain of compulsory purchase, and to publish the accounts of large companies and subject them to the scrutiny of the workers and the general public.	1.418022534072322
Society must have the means of enforcing its own agenda on large companies and their owners. The first item on that agenda is the eradication of unemployment.	1.2915471520617317
The sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone, without cutting wages, must be taken from the profits of large companies.	1.1200871556773142
It is far more important for the majority of society than the waste involved in financial operations or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders.	1.1818494007668032
. (SV) I cannot support the present resolution because, in paragraph 8, an individual factory in Italy is singled out with the express wish that precisely this establishment should remain in place, while the current management is being advised to try to sell the factory to a European tyre manufacturer.	1.3555234153833409
It is not the European Parliament' s business to express an opinion on which factories in the European Union' s 15 Member States are to remain in place and which are to be shut down; to expand their work forces or reduce them; stay in the same location or else move; be sold or not be sold; and, in the case of those which are to be sold, to comment on whether they are to be sold to companies within or outside Europe.	1.335391953743371
Ultimately, it is a question of different spheres of authority, where the European Parliament and its Members do not have any legal means of changing the current corporate decision or do not even have a particularly deep knowledge of the situation in the factory as it stands.	1.3036299449911009
The Swedish Christian Democrats would emphasise the value of the European Union' s and the European Parliament' s concentrating on their basic tasks and not undermining the value of their actions in these areas by also acting in areas outside their jurisdiction.	1.154891976739041
Tourism and employment	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5­0030/2000) by Mr Viceconte, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission: 'Enhancing tourism' s potential for employment - follow-up to the conclusions and recommendations of the High Level Group on Tourism and Employment' [COM(1999)0205 - C5-0112/1999 - 1999/2115(COS)].	0.9643790806134912
, rapporteur.	0.3427860826643694
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the European Union' s delay and indecision with regard to the introduction of a fully-fledged Community policy on tourism, increasing attention is being paid to tourism as a sector capable of generating new jobs.	1.2461051828197638
One of the reasons for the Community' s interest is the structural flexibility of this sector of the employment market, which explains its attractiveness for women and young people, to whom it often offers their first experience of employment.	1.3443426896118817
The importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone is now aware of this - is nevertheless based more on personal experience rather than on verifiable statistical data.	1.2314701942354738
The fact that, due to the absence of sufficiently reliable and scientific statistical data, the tourist industry is in effect an unknown quantity has greatly limited the prospects of pursuing a consistent policy in this area and creating employment on a wider scale.	1.0785800595058792
It would be appropriate, therefore, to begin by summarising the impact of tourism on the lives of Union citizens and the desirability, in both economic and social terms, of promoting the European tourist industry.	1.3810606896301767
Firstly, I would remind you that the tourist industry is one of the infrastructures which any advanced society must have. Without it, institutions, business and the world of work could not function.	1.3262532332485741
Tourism must therefore be thought of as the whole range of goods and services required by individuals moving from their habitual place of residence and thus confers mobility, the characteristic feature of contemporary society.	1.0973076452923363
The term 'tourism' must no longer be solely perceived as synonymous with sun, sea and holidays, which has the effect of reducing the interest taken in the subject at institutional level.	1.149711835404567
Secondly, I would like to explode a myth, taking as a starting point an apparent paradox, which is clearly highlighted by Eurostat figures: the main international tourist countries are not those traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, but on the contrary the most advanced nations, whose quality of life is one of their main attractions and most heavily promoted features.	1.3258700214471137
Clearly, the importance of tourism for the economy of regions traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, southern regions for example, is very different, and should be studied carefully.	1.4052563102418612
It is an obvious truth, and one that is measurable by other economic and social indicators, that thanks to tourism, many Mediterranean regions have undergone a radical change for the better in their economic and social system and the way of life of their inhabitants, and achieved a drastic reduction in the numbers emigrating.	1.4857760822011898
Social growth has occurred only in those areas where the tourist market has given rise to the development of all the activities required to meet the needs of visiting tourists, thus creating an entire productive system.	1.114055414060094
In such cases, there is a measurable increase in employment as a result of the growth in tourist numbers, thus establishing a virtuous circle of growth in the local economy.	1.1872683297060225
This reminds us that tourism cannot be regarded as the poor countries' petroleum industry, because it requires huge investment in structures, infrastructures, entrepreneurship, professional expertise, social services and training; that the tourist industry is essential for the equilibrium of many regions as it provides a direct source of employment and a market for all local productive activities: agriculture, small firms in the industrial and craft sector, transport, services, retail sector, training, etc; that the development of the Community' s tourist industry is closely linked to its sustainability with regard to the Community objectives; that the varied geography and historical, cultural and environmental heritage must be protected and exploited.	1.2670328810135958
In my opinion, the European Union can, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, supplement the action of the Member States and contribute to consolidating the potential of tourism by means of certain measures, such as the adoption of a specific legal basis for tourism policy in the Treaties; the adoption of mechanisms within the programmes and projects set up under its regional policies and other policies of the Union, with a view to promoting tourism in all its forms: rural, environmental, cultural, conference-based, spa-related and sports-related tourism, and also tourism focusing on senior citizens, research and training; the amendment of Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism; the cofinancing of projects to set up new transport services and infrastructures; the cofinancing of pilot schemes involving benchmarking and the exchange of experiences.	1.2528637309857198
These and other specific measures included in my report can, in my view, lend added value to the actions that the competent national and regional authorities should foster, in order to promote tourism and create new jobs, starting with the adoption of positive fiscal measures to assist small and medium-sized firms, particularly by reducing the burden of charges on labour.	1.2398223174343823
Mr President, Commissioner, before I explain to you the position of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I would like to share with you three basic factors which, in my opinion, determine the present and future of European tourism in an international environment.	1.1847267075811667
In Europe today, the tourism market contributes 5.5% of the gross national product and occupies a rather significant proportion of the workforce, approximately 6%.	1.1709423897939868
Those figures are incomparably higher for some countries.	0.7187908224023027
To grasp the importance of tourism for some parts of Europe, it is worth pointing out that in my own country, Greece, a country that attracts tourists, over the past four decades, during which the farming population has clearly aged and the population is over-concentrated in the major urban centres, the only areas which have retained populations of low average age or to which young people have returned are ones where tourism has developed.	1.2618300534695484
It is therefore clear that besides being a matter of general economic interest for Europe, tourism is a priority for the economic and social participation of the European Union' s regions.	1.3234325230380104
Another factor is that the world market is growing explosively.	1.2294437736913837
The forecast is for ten billion tourists in 2010, but unfortunately for Europe there is a reverse trend.	1.1954176969739594
Europe' s share of the increase is falling drastically each year to the benefit of Asia, the Far East and America.	0.9840653531679017
You see, the world tourism market is influenced every day and directly by the liberalisation of transport, its reduced cost, and competition from new centres of tourism outside Europe.	1.325456503150444
Furthermore, 90% of businesses active in tourism are small or medium-sized, the very enterprises which form the living cells of our social and economic tissue, which are called upon to tackle the new obstacles and respond positively to the challenges of this global development.	1.3247042221022463
As the rapporteur said, this becomes particularly important when tourism is appreciated as a unitary productive system because of its ability to absorb large quantities of agricultural and industrial products, services and transport and to create a significant amount of added value.	1.135172117101274
Here, then, I want to point out that international competition is tough and, if we are to overcome it positively, we must together envision and share a long-term strategy.	1.3979141691829815
We must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resources engaged in tourism, so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenges of our age.	1.2659228842749437
Today, nobody can ignore the fact that new digital technologies and systems, with Internet at the sharp end, mobile telephones and digital television, are bringing about radical changes in tourism as a whole and its respective structures and operational models.	1.2149905296619243
The introduction of these new technologies is not a threat, but a new opportunity for our tourism because it offers the potential to provide new and innovative tourism products and services, which our tourism needs for an ever-lengthening tourism season, so that it can attract new customers and offer new and alternative forms of tourism.	1.2960884104870507
The new technologies also make it possible to open new markets in traditionally undervalued, non tourist areas, which could develop to become centres of tourism and attract substantial investments.	1.2512297030533384
To this new labour market there must be a response in the programmes of tourism schools and training programmes for company staff, including programmes for training the unemployed and their re-introduction to work.	1.1927812341336417
The Committee on Women' s Rights paid particular attention to the issue of education, because according to official figures women account for 53% of those engaged in tourism services, and in parallel, they form a majority among the working people most easily affected by social and economic change.	1.3477451081617493
We must not forget that people working in tourism, especially women, encounter particular problems such as seasonal work, the need to renew contracts from one year to the next, social protection, lack of interest in continuing education, and reduced possibilities for development.	1.333107987829414
We therefore ask the European Commission for special measures and to adopt the principle of equal opportunities in all tourism programmes and programmes for company development.	1.381765107837289
Mr President, I would like to begin with some words of optimism, which came to us in the form of the High-Level Group communication of October 1998, the first page of which said that by the end of the next decade, it would be possible to create between 2 200 000 e 3 300 000 new jobs in tourism activities in the Union.	1.3568842449046505
In addition, it said that this would only happen if the right conditions were created.	1.4657311157662274
The Commission and Parliament are called upon to answer two questions: what are the right conditions and what is the role of the European Union on this?	1.3599033532868843
The Commission and Parliament can help us understand, in the first place, exactly what we are dealing with, because even the term 'tourism' , as was, moreover, pointed out in the Viceconte report, is still an ambiguous term, a kind of variable that depends on latitude, climate, a range of opportunities, and a series of background factors; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production, income, wealth and employment.	1.4109241257765148
There is a shortage of facts: we have no information on the economic impact, which still remains a complete mystery.	1.4784573240057002
We have criteria for the gathering and interpretation of statistics which are totally at odds with each other, despite what was said in a 1995 directive by the Commission and Parliament.	1.1856475858623927
With the aim of working out a strategy, it is vital to have a reading of these facts which harmonious and as strict as possible, so that we truly make tourism capable of creating jobs.	1.133792803186823
This does not follow automatically: often in the past a great deal of wealth has been accumulated thanks to the promotion of the tourist industry, without this being matched by an increase in employment.	1.2040822179476243
There is no legal basis, and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector.	1.3851780470977237
A legal basis translates into the ability to formulate strategies, to coordinate and to programme, all vital factors for making European Union tourism competitive with other markets.	1.2118274483741494
A legal basis would mean we would avoid having to draw on the Structural Funds, as was the case in the past, to obtain some loose change.	1.189728229946282
Moreover, only minimal amounts were made available to us: we should bear in mind that the Commission communication indicated amounts totalling EUR 4 700 000 000 over the last five years, which corresponds to the cost of building 400 kilometres of motorway.	1.3651191469957986
There is no opportunity to send a strong message to the Member States: recognising the legal basis of tourism would allow the States to acknowledge one of the European Union' s competences which at the moment, is only exercised in fits and starts.	1.386447566527128
We fully endorse the Community measures which were recommended in the Commission communication: advantageous taxation, that is, fiscal measures that offer conditions that are truly competitive in this market to the production sector - 95% of which, I would point out, is made up of small and medium-sized businesses, which is equivalent to 2 million small and medium-sized businesses in the European tourism sector; it awards special attention to vocational qualifications in the European Union, and therefore to investing in training; finally, it undertakes to make the job market transparent.	1.3689766660645886
The tourism market is by definition a flexible market; we do not want this flexibility to be seen in a solely negative light, with seasonal work being misinterpreted as illegal work: remember that 50% of employment, especially in southern countries of the European Union, is done on the black economy.	1.334288668724423
We feel that the European Union and the Commission needs to make a strong commitment to sustainable tourism, which means having a strategy that is compatible with the environment, after the excesses of recent years when private wealth often did not correspond to high levels of employment.	1.3154720299077463
First and foremost, we need to compete in terms of quality.	1.1940415866344025
Finally, we consider that tourism can, in addition to being a growth factor, be a factor for democracy, and in this regard we are asking the Commission for a clear, conscious commitment.	1.6182010294368923
Mr President, there are three points I wish to address.	1.5265947497008623
The first is the inclusion of a legal base in the Treaty.	1.3877494059229991
This is something I favour, but currently as part of a minority in my own Group.	1.5943838107138455
We are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism, both to local economies and as a factor of European integration.	1.3631838743054139
The problem for some of us, however, is the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to considerations of subsidiarity.	1.2004302884250022
Second, there are similar issues related to the establishment of a multiannual programme for tourism.	1.2268803180282926
The resolution contains many excellent ideas for the promotion of different types of tourism and for its increasing professionalism.	0.9583683840258658
At the same time the Commission is currently concerned about confining itself to core tasks.	1.3138509358909112
The question has to be asked whether some of the activities suggested in the resolution might not put more pressure on its resources than is desirable.	1.2641962437093923
Third, there are several references in the resolution to permanent employment.	1.3641239159276923
Of course the promotion of this is desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full-time employment.	1.1980434013848495
But there will always be people who are looking for seasonal employment.	1.0781886605223898
Students are an obvious example.	0.6513511257752677
We have some concern that the resolution does not give enough consideration to them and to ways in which their interests could receive specific protection.	1.1800349140319442
Thus, while complimenting Mr Viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend, we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed.	1.3880308078574508
Mr President, I too believe that tourism has a very important role to play, not just in our European regions, but throughout the world, because it is a great asset when it comes to economic and social development.	1.56846172270663
But it is also a very vulnerable sector, as we recently saw with the oil slick.	1.4181743769871396
A flourishing tourist sector can be totally wiped out by an ecological disaster such as an oil slick.	0.91708141632881
When it comes to tourism, we can no longer do what we like where we like.	1.398049329084492
There are huge reserves; certain zones, rural zones, so-called zones lagging behind but which still have unspoilt nature and untouched natural habitats, are listed as having good potential for what we call eco-tourism or green tourism.	1.1535420717428413
This could be developed and provide a large number of new jobs.	1.0913717242201961
But these regions need to take real account of positive and negative experiences in other tourist sectors.	1.037552270856513
We must not kill the goose that lays the golden egg of tourism.	0.8748106724903811
Tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future.	1.2460868781043444
I can think of many mountain regions which are continually spoilt in order to develop a tourist sector.	1.028994254510176
We have stopped counting the damage and destruction in natural habitats and mountain zones.	0.8757041120124449
I should also like to refer to the darker side of tourism, the tourism exported from the Member States of the European Union. I am referring to sex tourism.	1.2917145535537586
I know that action is being taken against this so-called tourism elsewhere, but we must remember the European Union' s responsibility at this level.	1.5415774901016623
Under no circumstances can we, as responsible politicians, allow what is currently happening to continue, with young girls practically bought in the countries of the East and coming here to be abused on the cheap.	1.2209446052797166
Finally, I should like to refer to the tourism which gives citizens contact with the outside world and democracy.	1.1232901467146612
I am thinking in particular of countries such as Cuba which are isolated but I know, because I have travelled there extensively, that the Cubans who come into contact with tourists can learn something of the outside world, obtain different information and pass on different information.	1.1921075121708726
For all these reasons, I think that reforming the Treaties would allow the huge tourist question, which is an important asset for the whole planet, to be properly integrated.	1.4928395486619825
Mr President, during the most recent meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was pleasantly surprised.	1.233402039079808
The opinion of Mr Sánchez García, addressed to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, contained a remark regarding the IGC.	1.0495358072678782
The draftsman of the opinion held the view that there was no need for a legal foundation for tourism in the Treaty.	1.30285092852993
This was in contrast to the majority opinion held in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	0.988587576908832
Having heard many Members who share the view expressed in the opinion, this was a real relief.	1.495408500223082
Unfortunately, his text has not survived the vote.	1.1790358473393596
It does, however, support my view that I am not, apparently, the only one who cannot agree with the majority opinion.	1.5764776224444552
This brings me to the content of the report.	0.7141490943012156
An important aspect of the tourism industry is employment and potential employment.	0.9990574364119575
Especially in the southern Member States, the tourist industry is a major source of income.	1.2793691622539949
From this vantage point, there is every reason for the government to formulate stimulating measures and a stimulating policy.	1.2482463120588718
The seasonal nature of tourism and the employment fluctuations that this entails also deserve attention.	1.0239628898102078
I am surprised, however, at the fact that many want to achieve this by means of Community policy.	1.4089224603383956
This is not desirable, either from the point of view of tourism itself or the stimulation of employment.	1.228030366060142
The discrepancies between the different regions can often be traced back to cultural or historical factors.	0.8832669097195454
Within these regions, a huge range of problems have their part to play.	1.2640897689589203
It is obvious that mainly local and regional - and, therefore, to a lesser extent national - authorities are best placed to assess the situation and draft appropriate policy.	1.2221105399833398
For this reason, I cannot therefore endorse the transfer of powers to European level.	1.3353830737972858
In addition, employment policy in general is also a factor.	1.5666535597422688
Here too, the structure of the economy differs for each Member State, and the ways in which the current status has been achieved are diverse.	1.3416504122736679
It will not do for one type of policy, probably with many exceptions and adaptations, to be applied.	1.351020298920212
This would mean that the EU would unjustly be removing tasks from Member States and that the Brussels bureaucracy would be intervening unnecessarily.	1.153006204179977
It is preferable for Member States to take measures to stimulate employment themselves.	1.0176048990604016
Their expertise, is, of course, superior to that of the Commission.	1.1060676366020654
This is why I am very hesitant when it comes to formulating Community measures to promote employment.	1.4510418419292048
Even in the tourism industry.	1.1212447303720723
It would really be a nuisance if Parliament were to attempt to achieve this unofficially by extending its powers.	0.9569258914564219
Mr President, you will understand that we cannot assent to the present resolution as it stands.	1.4857325628406495
First of all I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report.	1.320034730232542
It is a very extensive report.	1.3124111568384809
We greatly welcome it, just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on, the report of the high-level working group which was set up by the European Commission.	1.3436880641085949
I hope that the Commission will not forget that.	1.4038117957067597
Having set it up, I hope the Commission actually makes use of it and therefore does not just allow it to sit around in the corridors and gather dust.	1.2970254480060617
Tourism is basically small businesses and therefore a very fertile area for job creation.	0.9440436576564518
As has already been said in this debate, three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for.	1.1350423305098458
Europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy-making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position.	1.2865806115110379
We need a more dynamic vision based on tourism' s contribution to job creation.	1.0971712552157828
We must recognise a sector that is predominantly engaged in cross-border activity and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating, innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development.	1.0621489386872778
I know the Commissioner is very keen on information technology.	1.1567111725068608
He has convinced me of that.	0.6008803482820485
But his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together.	0.9181220096734546
There are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal test-bed, therefore, for integrating job creation strategies.	1.2087886083310777
Let us look at some of these reasons.	1.1039934140114616
The importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one.	1.2211437564078236
Various sectors of the population are employed by the tourism industry, particularly the more vulnerable groups, such as young people, women and the unskilled.	1.2549679940037906
I am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first.	1.5909029879290049
The availability of unskilled, temporary and seasonal work is very important in some of the economic areas of the Community.	1.2418458717748224
Tourism contributes to regional development - in rural areas that are maybe trying to diversify - and tourism contributes to urban areas that aim to raise the profile of their own cultural heritage.	1.3518411930080623
If we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in Europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across Europe.	1.1493790089005824
We must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitors who come to Europe' s shores to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that has not been opened up to the world for quite a number of years - in fact, about forty years.	1.252037703039589
We are losing market share.	0.652065173921475
I believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive.	1.3099130097282108
I hope you will help us.	0.8110131844887162
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are addressing a very important sector that directly involves over 10 million jobs in the European Union and helps the more or less disadvantaged, island and remote areas to stand on their own feet.	1.1270845617126288
And of course, tourism creates more jobs and contributes to the stimulation of employment, especially among society' s more sensitive sections: women and young people.	1.2507586377626936
In view of all this, I think it is a serious contradiction that there is no European policy on tourism.	1.6080409519789551
The lack of any legal base makes it impossible to adopt measures relating to the sector.	0.9127399181426664
The occasional application of Article 308 - formerly Article 235 - which requires unanimity, has prevented the adoption of a programme even of only EUR 8 million for five years and 15 Member States.	1.315509102044761
The measures taken from time to time in the past have been fragmentary and therefore ineffective, and such provisions as have been made were dictated by parallel policies such as consumer protection, environmental policy, transport policy, taxation policy, etc., which very often are not only no help to tourism but on the contrary make it more difficult, since their introduction has usually entailed costs for the tourism industry without regard to its ability to bear them or its incentives to cope with them.	1.3756200899761744
With sorrow, I stress that in the context of restructuring the Commission' s services, tourism is dealt with by a section, not even a directorate, within the Directorate-General for 'Enterprise' .	1.4401560390129984
But we must support our tourism!	1.2484981182458996
In our view, the axes which could create a basis for its support are: the addition of material capital for tourism in the new review which will also constitute a legal base for the sector, the framing of a Community tourism policy to support the sector without disturbing the operation of the tourism market, coordination of the tourism policy with other, parallel Community policies which affect it directly or indirectly, a study of the sector, and the adoption of medium and long-term measures to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a product.	1.2982022943831577
Mr President, Commissioner, since the issue of employment has been raised, I want to recall another issue which is also very serious, namely the bankruptcies among Tour Operators and their consequences mainly for hotels, which are small or medium enterprises lacking the necessary organisation and access to information that would indicate to them whether or not their contractual partners are trustworthy.	1.2979489817424437
Clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level.	1.0431720169378564
In contrast, at European level it would be possible to look into measures for improving the relations between hotels and Tour Operators, for example a regulation of such relations, the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund, etc., in collaboration with representatives from the two branches.	1.3128907183653733
In the past, the Commission had requested quantitative records of the losses incurred by companies because of such bankruptcies, so that it could form an opinion, and asked the European confederations of hotel-and-restaurant owners and tourist agencies, HOTREC and ECTAA, to work out and draw up a regulation to govern the relations between them.	1.3092691759431545
Since then, however, there has been no progress.	1.0688233165936865
There must therefore be measures to improve the quality and competitiveness of Europe' s tourism and, to the extent of the possible, safeguard the operation of companies.	1.349978937408736
Such measures must also aim to promote rational use of natural and cultural assets and of the tourism infrastructure, so contributing to the balanced and sustainable development of tourism.	1.2050335666611578
I will end by congratulating Mr Viceconte and, as one who comes from Crete, a tourist area, I ask that we should always view tourism not only in terms of pleasant holidays but as a primary job creator in a Europe which needs those jobs.	1.4284295840509016
Mr President, Commissioner, the new attitude adopted recently by the Commission on this important economic activity is striking to those of us who, in recent years, have kept an eye on tourism and its place in the Community framework.	1.4416727909929323
We all know that this change of heart is basically due to the close cause-effect relationship between tourism and employment. It is also due to the recognition by the European Union, since the 1997 conference on these issues, of the enormous potential, represented by tourism, for employment.	1.5171036432973384
In this respect the Commission communication before us today is opportune, as is the report by Mr Viceconte whom I congratulate.	1.6345876880092496
This report contains 34 conclusions, including 15 calls to the Commission to adopt specific measures and actions without forgetting the environmental dimension and cultural protection, particularly in outermost and island regions.	1.3966938266170483
It also contains four calls to the Member States which highlight the need to coordinate actions with the regional authorities and the establishment of measures favourable to tourist-oriented SMEs, particularly in the tax sector and in access to financial instruments. These would encourage the growth of employment in sectors which use labour intensively, such as the tourist sector.	1.2280929461208672
Finally, once this legal basis to which many of us aspire has been established so that a common tourism policy can be developed, we must be realistic and prepare a strategy on tourism and its relationship with employment, as proposed by the Commission with the support of this House. In this strategy, young people and women, training and quality and the new information society must receive preferential attention.	1.5044466161652867
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Viceconte for his report, which has drawn our attention to a sector which is all too often underestimated.	1.2861157645794519
Tourism is a social, economic and cultural phenomenon which affects most European citizens, either as the recipients or the providers of a wide variety of services.	1.1374809022647676
Every year, nearly 200 million Europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel, usually to other countries in Europe.	1.1355868195623675
Moreover, Europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries, even though it faces increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products.	1.1399027866430063
Since the Treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real Community tourism policy, the European Union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment.	1.3448584416419345
Vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in Europe especially, as far as tourist service providers are concerned, in meeting multicultural demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers.	1.2153971394901417
Employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious, thereby hampering its sustainable development.	1.028436015230982
It is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible.	1.123392863190531
As the report notes, the adoption by the Member States of tax incentives for SMEs in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour-intensive sectors and, consequently, in the tourism sector.	1.4520166180899878
This sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions, especially the most remote and island regions, which have undisputed assets in this area.	1.4170756204328918
Let us not forget that, in the most remote regions, tourism is the most important industry in terms of income.	1.2037586237795315
The income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community.	0.879379129212799
In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it makes us more aware of other European cultures and thus helps respect for European ways of life to develop.	1.1809485915504936
It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed rationally in the long term, should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies, while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural, cultural, historical and environmental heritage.	1.2714931314279236
I should like to close by stressing the essential role which the European Union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental Europeans to discover the most far-flung destinations in Europe, namely the most remote regions.	1.3033489100001185
Mr President, we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance. The basic document is really no more than a Commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment.	1.4491881246485718
Not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 April 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old.	1.1640348361012438
This document stems from the previous Commission. It is undoubtedly the result of work carried out by Commissioner Papoutsis throughout his term of office and which culminated in the Luxembourg summit and his failed Philoxenia programme.	1.178378356340644
I believe this is the first debate in this House with the new Commission and a new Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, who is of course listening very closely to what we are discussing.	1.7508427947108702
I would take this opportunity to ask him a couple of questions directly.	1.028443430544029
Firstly, the governments made a commitment at the Maastricht Conference of 1992 to include a legal basis for this issue in the Treaties. This commitment was not fulfilled in the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 and is therefore outstanding.	1.4687645203084025
Yet there is a Council resolution from last June on tourism and employment.	1.0700745876919358
What expectations does the Commissioner have that the new Intergovernmental Conference which is starting will include this aspect?	1.1151051186823755
My second question is much more direct and perhaps more awkward.	0.988766277957304
Bearing in mind the failed efforts of the last decade, as highlighted by Mr Koch, does Commissioner Liikanen believe that he can do something during his term of office to ensure that the Community dimension of tourism becomes a proper policy, given the importance that all the previous speakers have given to tourism in terms of employment?	1.457518791274976
Will the Commission present new initiatives in order to see whether, through the constant efforts of the Commission and Parliament, we can gradually convince the Council to do something on this issue?	1.6063671830173571
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte, who spoke at such length on the tangible possibility, for the fifteen Member States of the Union, of creating jobs by way of a sensible policy, a sensible European Union initiative in this field.	1.3815487049265853
This very afternoon we have had a debate on workers who suddenly find themselves unemployed. We now hope to be able to solve these problems.	1.2616295222089493
Tourism is an activity that falls decidedly and fundamentally within the competence of the European Union.	0.7706284751595124
All the European States are known throughout the world for being tourist magnets envied by all, including the United States of America, which we spoke about this afternoon with regard to the native Americans.	1.4843727840425935
I would like to stress one point in the Viceconte report which I welcome and particularly support, and which I would like the House and the Commission to reflect on before giving a favourable response.	1.6351804657093192
It regards tourism for senior citizens.	0.6102269010324592
I usually see Commissioner Diamantopoulou desperately tearing her hair out, bit by bit, because the elderly live too long, leading to problems with pension payments.	1.0555027362235498
However, in this case, the fact that we are living longer means that there are more senior citizens.	1.5204074887286563
Unfortunately not all, but many of them travel the world to see its marvels and to discover and learn more about it: Italians want to see what the English are like, the Greeks want to see what the Turks are like and the French want to see their Italian cousins.	1.3683976960023736
Tourism brings the peoples of the fifteen States and of the entire world closer together, and of course, it leads to peace and understanding.	1.4886435238514557
This kind of tourism, which is undertaken mainly by large numbers of senior citizens, is just as important.	1.335377466308139
This type of tourism must be promoted and supported because it allows people to work in tourist destinations, not just during the summer when we go swimming in the sea, for example, but also during winter when we go to take the air.	1.356315836488718
Senior citizens are always on holiday, all year round, from 1 January through to 31 December because they do not work and do not have just one month off during the year.	1.2557268530763688
Unfortunately, this is not true of them all, but this is why I am calling on the Commission to follow up on the Viceconte report.	1.6809430005311485
. Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte and congratulate him on the report.	1.090037321031025
I think we all acknowledge the economic, social and environmental importance of tourism in today' s developed Europe and its great potential for growth and employment.	1.090776658013058
I am glad to see that the Commission and Parliament are converging towards the same goal in this area.	1.1119142307557832
Employment issues are at present the core concern regarding tourism.	0.9869246127486087
An essential condition in order to make good progress in the work in this respect is that the cooperation with Member States and the industry and with other partners be as fruitful as possible.	1.4904999515531825
This will determine the success of our work.	0.9624421530622157
Certainly the Commission will seek good coordination with national employment policies.	1.1225734575512205
This will also be important with a view to the special summit in March, where tourism is bound to be mentioned as a significant contributor to employment.	1.2482049801939867
Coordination of Community tourism activities with other important issues such as regional policies, transport, employment, environment, culture and competition must strongly involve Member States and the tourism industry itself.	1.1624941528774302
As far as specific policies are concerned, I would like to pinpoint just one on which the draft resolution focuses - regional policy.	1.3025169499678042
The Commission guideline document for the new structural fund' s programming period has already identified tourism as one of the areas with particular potential for employment creation through competitive enterprises.	1.1059086143551624
The Commission expects Member States to put increased emphasis on tourism measures in their plans and programming.	1.0318791995570664
Quality, sustainability, innovation are at the forefront of the Commission' s own policy and are priorities recognised by the Council of Ministers.	1.2662301051319278
Quality products in order to improve competitiveness, sustainability in order to protect resources and innovation in particular through the use of information technologies.	1.1889162975638827
Regarding sustainability indicators, the European Environment Agency is already working with the Commission on the issue.	1.4904632109835354
I want to mention, as has already been mentioned by many speakers today, that tourism related to the natural and cultural heritage is expected to be the fastest expanding form of tourism in the EU during the next two decades.	1.456020672178794
These possibilities should be fully exploited.	0.8234891643342345
Mr Provan said that I often talk a lot about tourism and information technology.	1.0361448511058327
I am personally convinced that information and communication technologies will be a key competitiveness and innovation factor for European tourism.	1.1237733693248857
The travel and tourism sector is the front-runner in making use of ICT tools.	0.9343397812942417
This will dramatically change the way it operates.	0.9661444344302106
Marketing, reservation and transport are expected to be the areas of profoundest change and improvement.	1.0275951796682916
Use of ICT opens a completely new dimension in the context of travel and tourism.	0.9810208807587691
Direct business to consumer contact will supplement, and sometimes also reduce, the currently, nearly exclusive business to business relationship.	1.2852163441014566
It will give more and better choice to tourists and generate new and better tourist products.	0.885366948083697
For the Commission this requires that action in the tourism field must be tightly linked to measures promoting the take-up of information communication technology by the tourism industry, in particular by the innovation and innovative society technological programmes which are both within my competence.	1.2546852350792033
The new strategy outlined by the Commission communication on tourism and employment, and agreed by the Council, places the emphases on tourism gathering and disseminating information and good practice.	1.2495837292310754
The implementation of the directive on statistics aims at improving the knowledge of market structures and trends in European tourism and its industry.	1.2028639769049145
Commission decisions have advanced the methodological approach.	0.6604058373890944
The report on the experience acquired in the work carried out under this directive is part of our work programme for the current year.	1.365903079078185
More work on the social and economic impact of tourism is currently on-going with the international organisations, such as the World Tourism Organisation.	1.2032819678134614
The European Community' s prime role is to ensure a framework which enables and encourages stakeholders and authorities at all levels to optimise and realise the tourism sector' s potential for growth and employment.	1.1546218940827908
Such a European strategy will be achieved through building on the commitment by Member States and the Commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas: exchange and dissemination of information, notably through new technologies; training in order to upgrade skills, quality of tourist products and sustainable development in tourism.	1.1861502269278645
In the autumn the Commission will report back on the progress made in this respect.	1.2233316354040524
A report on the work to be undertaken, together with the Member States and the tourism industry should be available in about two years from now.	1.1593949184080474
Depending on the results of this work, a wider debate could then take place which might well be the starting-point for even more comprehensive policy initiatives.	1.180407102900035
Mr Medina Ortega asked me some very concrete questions.	0.7759775178169612
As regards the role of tourism policy in the communities concerned, we must understand that many policy sectors have a huge impact on the framework on tourism.	1.2804549961184066
It is not only the targeted, specific tourism actions which are important but the other horizontal actions in the field of transport.	1.2475149115512756
At the moment, the question of congestion of air and roads is the fundamental problem.	1.1096824444604962
In the area of environment, we are looking at ways to cooperate with Mrs Wallström; in the area of regional policy Mr Barnier is giving a lot of attention to this sector.	1.5305564275693577
We need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies.	1.2875017920298157
I am sure that we will improve on that in the future when we have had a good high-level working group report, your support with your report here and also when the tourism sector is part of enterprise policy.	1.47730880313482
Why is it so important in that sector?	0.8906557977227904
It is because the key emphasis on the enterprise policy will be how to help to create new enterprises; how to make it easier for young people and women to create their own enterprises.	1.213299040875167
That is where the potential is.	0.8005860175012574
If we can eliminate the obstacles to make it cheaper to create new enterprises, to facilitate the access to financing and to change the attitude of society to be more positive entrepreneurship, I am sure the tourism sector will be the first to benefit from this.	1.5012449577849822
There is one problem that I hesitate to mention today as I am new in the sector.	1.240011212423815
I have been working now in all industrial and service sectors, but when you look at the organisational structure in tourism it is almost impossible.	1.2859843845393344
It is very difficult for a Commissioner to try to work in an area where there are dozens of different organisations whose representativeness needs to be ascertained every time.	1.2141714970378372
To strengthen the role of tourism in Europe, the organisations should do what has happened in most economic sectors: seek better focus, better coordination and concentrated activities.	1.2765376889187632
Then we could have a solid dialogue in our everyday work.	1.0497364718877835
That is the real difficulty which we must overcome.	1.3582378889102464
As far as the Treaty is concerned, the intergovernmental conference started this week so we do not know the results yet.	1.4475042451575468
I want to be very candid: I have not seen much enthusiasm about that conference or the proposal to enlarge the powers of the EU.	1.5129849156130948
Tourism is also in the list of subjects which do not figure as new areas of competence for the EU.	0.9737246789563888
We will see what happens but at the moment that seems to be the case.	1.4052151319689723
Finally, the Commission welcomes the resolution which continues the line of the high-level group, the Commission communication on enhancing tourism' s potential for employment and the corresponding Council conclusions.	1.3468997520085215
The general agreement between both institutions in this field must not keep the Commission from following the most pragmatic approach in achieving our common objectives.	1.1201859935962941
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.	0.6204212530316258
(The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m.)	0.6496601847660328
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	0.4510321946745718
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	0.3735514178617478
Are there any comments?	0.1337831580886173
Mr President, yesterday' s Minutes will naturally indicate interventions referring to the so-called 'Strasbourg Declaration" which intends to implicate the European Parliament in certain considerations which would literally lead to the conclusion that I am a Nazi.	1.3039225723329333
This declaration - which, as I have said, implicates the European Parliament, although no such declaration was put before this Parliament - is a completely unacceptable form of manipulation.	1.3040369097932576
I thank the President, Mrs Fontaine, who just yesterday expressed her opinion by refuting the implication of this House.	1.3146881090410634
Mr President, as well as discrediting the PNV, Eusko Alkartasuna and the democratic government of the Basque Country - who have the kind of attitude which, in the case of Ireland, deserved the Nobel prize - by calling them Nazis, the declaration insults representatives of the European citizens - as in my case: I represent a section of Galician society - by saying that we are more dangerous than the Nazis, and insults groups which are clearly democratic, with decades of history, in an unacceptable and crazy way, which I would like to condemn here and now.	1.500905592608342
I would like these words to be heard, because the European Parliament cannot be implicated in this way in a crazy declaration which I consider to be totally unacceptable.	1.5067098747715728
Thank you, Mr Nogueira, for your explanation.	1.5688623709545129
I would remind you that questions on the Minutes should refer to the Minutes.	0.9604720810297251
In any event, for those Members who not aware of the President' s position, I will read the official communication and it will thereby appear in today' s Minutes:	1.396642432771135
"On 17 February, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, President of the European Parliament, received as guests, at their request, the representatives of the Forum d' Ermua.	1.2465108948607924
The Spanish Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament were represented.	1.28578774033228
Following this interview, the representatives of this Forum presented her with a text entitled "Strasbourg Declaration" . The President wishes to specify that under no circumstances does she sanction the terms of this "declaration" .	1.246063225120908
Strasbourg, 17 February" .	0.8098128321376267
I therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up.	1.125043658346251
Mr President, I would like to request a correction to the Minutes regarding the vote on Amendment No 5 of the Swoboda report.	1.1769327199713522
Please note that Mr Michel Raymond, Mr Jean Saint-Josse and I voted against this amendment.	1.129891547301415
We take note and this will appear in the Minutes.	1.0399475794213904
Mr President, this is not exactly a point of order but concerns a communication we have before us today, namely that the Conference of Presidents open to Members, which was scheduled for 23 February, has now been cancelled.	1.5010381309326208
We should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings.	1.0943860345915777
I have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform.	1.2964141295413323
We can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers.	0.8739590474719929
That would be more productive and I do not like seeing the various committee agendas that are already overloaded being cut again and again because of this kind of show-piece.	1.2223122239725654
So I think we should consider simply abolishing these meetings once and for all.	1.046270228023063
Mr Bösch, I take note of your observation but, clearly, we hold this type of Conference of Presidents, open to all MEPs at the original request of the MEPs, so that they may participate in some of them.	1.4319925752486293
Surely we should be more selective.	1.2331023246364679
In any event, the Bureau will consider your suggestion.	0.9727352212514639
(The Minutes were approved)	0.08791063492812108
VOTE	-0.0
Mr President, we should like to request that the last sentence of Amendment No 2 which reads: 'also calls on the Member States to promote tourism for the elderly' be incorporated into Paragraph 25, which deals specifically with social tourism, after: 'tourism for organised social groups...'.	1.4283625857032745
We think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective.	0.8801544352584124
Mr President, the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental principles underlying cooperation in the European Union.	1.2922752684971446
It is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the EU's areas of competence.	1.1270046686523858
A criticism which is often levelled at the EU and which, to some extent, is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas.	1.4424185680179613
One such area is tourism which, by its very nature, is very much a national concern.	1.3250948682051937
In so far as tourism falls within the political domain, it should be at national, regional and local level.	1.1077746561722135
Tourism is a major source of employment and has a role to play as regards the EU's financial support for less well-off regions.	1.2999430389275557
Even in that respect, any cooperation should, however, be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle.	1.3392892375061087
Because tourism can also have a harmful impact on the environment, there needs to be a strategy for damage limitation.	1.375758007102341
However, such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy.	1.6028853642495167
The report laments the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism.	1.191637102685434
However, the Swedish Christian Democrats would oppose any such development as we believe that tourism is a matter with which the European Union should only be marginally concerned.	1.4577692485784357
. (DA) Tourism is a significant source of international understanding and an important part of the labour market, which ought to be promoted and encouraged.	1.2644796628708372
It is of inestimable importance that people in Europe, as well as in the rest of the world, should have the opportunity to experience each other' s ways of ordering their lives and their societies.	1.1580042616730641
Policy on tourism is not, however, something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the European Parliament or by the EU as a whole.	1.3610723290279427
I am therefore voting against the proposal.	1.1429222242361379
Mr President, before we begin our discussion, as an Italian MEP - and I believe I also speak on behalf of all Italian MEPs - I should like to condemn the position taken yesterday by the German Chancellor, who interfered in Italian internal affairs, when he threatened that Europe would intervene if any neo-fascists became members of the government.	1.5666977531844446
Fortunately, the Italian Government and the President of the Republic intervened, and today the Italian Ambassador to Germany will also speak on the subject, to call on the German Chancellor not to interfere in Italian internal affairs, in so far as there are no neo-fascist candidates for government office.	1.4501572487715257
We would like to thank the President of the Republic, as well as the Government and all the politicians who spoke and we too, in this House, would also call on the German Chancellor not to intervene in Italian internal affairs.	1.4171396207002456
Mr Tajani will accept that it is a little difficult to understand the relationship between his intervention and the points of order, but I understand his political meaning.	1.409931863817316
We will proceed to the debate itself and Mr Monti will take the floor on behalf of the Commission.	1.1036995452146745
European postal services	-0.0
The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0010/2000) tabled by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the Commission, on European postal services.	1.1086309745936085
Mr President, the Commission's proposal on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of postal services has been delayed mainly because of the reorganisation and reallocation of duties within the Commission and the fact that the new Commission needs to re-examine the issues involved.	1.3739300027728054
With regard to Parliament's various resolutions on the postal sector, my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, has already responded to some of the main points at the hearings which Parliament held last year.	1.299416612500011
Furthermore, as regards consultations with Parliament, Commissioner Bolkestein will meet the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism next Monday.	1.445076246282298
The studies were sent to the committee and to the MEPs who requested them, in September 1999 and are, in any case, still available.	1.4722336093570318
They can also be consulted on the Commission's Internet website.	1.332068060706008
I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein will listen carefully to all Parliament's comments.	1.163612828745594
The Commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector.	1.2889714540893262
Furthermore, the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation.	1.3140035794962275
I can confirm that it is Commissioner Bolkestein' s firm intention to present a proposal to the Commission by the middle of the year, to be forwarded to Parliament and the Council.	1.3625856736043833
The date set for completing the next phase, which the Commission intends to keep to, is 1 January 2003.	1.37240468007478
The proposal will take account of the studies and, in particular, the need to maintain a universal service, to develop efficient safeguards for consumers, to create a climate favourable to new jobs and to solve any problems relating to competition.	1.2054335203356719
The role of liberalisation in modernising and improving postal services throughout the Union with the help of new technologies will be examined in order to identify potential benefits for the industry as a whole.	1.1274996200836802
The proposal, when it is put forward, will take account of the points of view of Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties, all of whom have been involved in an in-depth consultation process.	1.3184509892083107
The aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the European Union.	0.997949734823406
Mr President, the postal sector continues to be an area in which old, outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition.	1.3105983586898065
And, in the absence of any energetic action by the Commission, the situation has gone on for far too long.	1.3720911049713842
The EU' s competition authority has intervened in all other areas, but not in the postal sector.	1.176993652617011
We have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the Commission to put forward proposals, so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new, modern Europe-wide postal system.	1.250257769420703
One of the EU' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market.	1.388533810542043
We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States.	0.8768737461183236
That requires greater efficiency which, in turn, is dependent on competition.	1.2206559174999887
Today, one area after another is being compelled to introduce deregulation and liberalisation, an exercise in which the EU often leads the way, while the Commission's determination to make progress serves as a model.	1.389521983671744
The Commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects.	1.0663263378651107
It is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and, moreover, because it will lead to lower prices. All that, we are assured, will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market.	1.4617868116799788
It has been done in a number of different areas but, unfortunately, the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now.	1.2735533396420824
It can hardly be because customers are satisfied.	0.676977140151898
We are all familiar with the much-criticised price hikes, and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion.	1.0631565604874091
If we really want a functioning internal market, we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services.	1.230826211047746
A number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services.	1.2457457287677853
The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have travelled furthest along this road.	0.8726626951366147
During the 1990s, they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved.	1.2822192133974128
Moreover, Sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus.	1.2362190811192946
The process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement.	1.0163490291255148
Experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which, as customers, we are all entitled to expect.	1.1929182125357225
Prior to this discussion, a letter was sent out by supporters of the old monopolies.	1.2427694367311792
They hold up Sweden as a warning, which might be appropriate in certain instances, but not as regards postal services.	1.4358710505349157
It is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993.	0.8738294007116266
That is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where, in practice, there is still a monopoly, that is where the state is the only player.	1.4543160390031304
However, for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market, prices have fallen.	1.4551771774903912
That shows that competition really is working.	0.6909030145854498
My conclusion is therefore: make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market, too.	1.192340468529098
It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for ...	0.8805045178995593
(The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov) I thought I had the floor.	1.0640274731530301
Perhaps we can discuss this later on.	0.6133435930818822
However, I should like to affirm that it is exactly as I said, namely, that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition, whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly.	1.3886264138156688
That is usually the case.	0.5417325787201347
That is why I should now like to see a Commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector.	1.2846142987026774
Mr Markov, in five or six minutes time, you will be allowed a few minutes to speak.	1.367246729486572
I would be grateful if you would not interrupt other Members.	1.0051098712795599
Mr President, there is a mystery.	1.2813589563641896
What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997?	0.980625776202355
There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now.	1.0730362540950427
I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today.	1.1369961326257203
I am very fond of him.	1.0418428445011345
He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners.	0.9859158153797325
It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues.	1.4987632819188774
There has, over this period, been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive.	1.3197173709000802
Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties.	1.035326505385135
That has only happened recently.	0.5806899787390365
For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this.	1.10876498395201
We really have not progressed very far.	0.8778822974907182
However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about.	1.5079783983871422
It was about gradual liberalisation; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector.	1.2663323496587622
These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive.	0.9874108612082194
The postal service is not just for Christmas.	1.473120497461367
It is for life.	1.0509166549842601
In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service.	1.2707641432583414
It is about keeping communities together.	0.9691372755912055
The postal service is also the bus service.	0.9253364410723294
The postal service is also the social service.	0.9598517765086841
The postal service is also the doctor.	0.9075890909665187
If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade.	1.415689992033701
We will cut them off.	0.6585557462039803
The postal services are important.	0.8606256290226936
That message must be taken back from here today.	0.9405330296591613
The Commission must listen to it.	1.0739310838659137
Mr President, we are in favour of liberalising the Union' s postal services.	1.3418287765697228
This should first of all stand for better service.	1.1280765881300168
This is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal.	1.2530843578286934
Liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly.	1.019259111328209
Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer' s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly, because, for example, the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically?	1.0995859561543841
The question is, therefore: what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet?	1.2768690553474442
Most Member States have been putting the brakes on, and I am pleased to note that, in my country, the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago, and that the Belgian postal services and the Belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition.	1.5159962668635207
As you can see, as a new MEP, I am trying to get to grips with the dossier and I must admit that I have great difficulty doing so.	1.3332766424612759
I have found a number of studies which were commissioned by the European Commission at the time, and I am also coming across documents from Post-Europe which claims that these studies are inaccurate and that the basis on which these were carried out is incorrect.	1.2978752023201547
I think that the Commission could have been more pro-active on this score and could have also provided us with the studies which it had promised to give us and which we had requested.	1.3651954198220402
As far as I know, that has still not happened.	1.4383695545839
I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to help me in my task as a new Member.	1.2582171689264248
Like Mr Miller, I would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the 1997 directive within the next couple of months or weeks or, if at all possible, within the next couple of days.	1.3150253022882044
My second point concerns the universal provision of services. What is happening on this score, how much does it cost, how does it work, how do you intend to organise it and what proposals do you have?	1.2838430537689618
I would welcome more concrete information on this.	0.966505058752146
Apparently, the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so.	1.3350846692287741
There are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the Post Office.	0.8848634652275584
Moreover - and Mr Miller has already pointed this out - it will surely not be the end of the world if the postman no longer comes round, even in my country, however densely populated it may be.	1.6515994512907606
But in Belgium too, there are a great number of people, older people for example, who only see one other person in the day and that is the postman.	1.613472093363666
We should not overlook this fact: postal service is about more than just ferrying around letters and parcels.	1.18274003348163
The postal service is also extremely important to companies.	0.896769569800948
A study has shown that 90% of the postal traffic is between companies and only 10% between individuals.	1.1245597244109145
What exactly do you intend to liberalise?	0.5734064497712645
I would like more information on this, because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services.	1.4236750839210848
There are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job.	1.0992238009902862
We need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things.	1.0348607761379283
Mr President, Commissioner, this morning on French national radio, I heard that liberalisation of the French postal service was now only a matter of days or hours away and that it was irreparable, like the developments with our neighbours in Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany.	1.4554840731140477
This concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today.	1.2222886692389479
The Commission is committed to a universal postal service, as the European Parliament has shown on several occasions, the postal service is actually, as some speakers have already mentioned, a key factor in social and territorial cohesion.	1.4424787291318355
In this connection I should like to ask one of our Swedish MEPs for an opinion of the study which has been carried out and which shows that in fact in the most remote areas of Sweden the postal service was rather poor in terms of distribution.	1.3939880270397629
That is not the sort of postal service that we want.	1.1938410699554578
The economic value of the postal service was recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of mail.	1.232330210512004
It is the service which remains closest to the citizens and which we call a 'public service' , which makes it possible for everyone resident within European territory to receive the service, and this entitlement must remain an acquired right, an acquis communautaire.	1.4580815153999187
The matter of the European Union' s recognition of a high-quality postal service, available to all, remains valid today, and we are increasingly concerned.	1.4819816888822743
That is why today we are asking not to have any nasty surprises in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism come Monday.	1.2647500895640802
Let us point out that Parliament' s positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supported them.	0.962181760912312
This resolution of 14 January 1999 required that, prior to undertaking any liberalisation of this key sector, involving 1.7 million employees after all, the Commission should provide impact studies for this liberalisation.	1.2552747475775485
Well, we are not convinced that the studies currently available make it possible to implement this liberalisation right now and we are concerned because it is well known that liberalisation without impact studies would cause thousands of job losses, something we certainly do not want.	1.3906888039259568
We value our public service, our universal postal service, because we know, and here too we are acting as representatives of the citizens, that the citizens value this service and the Commission undertook, during Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, to maintain this universal service throughout the European Union.	1.5168659745408042
I shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing, I think we all still remember them.	1.3411196116158892
We further maintain that we are waiting for this proper evaluation before any definitive decision, as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive.	1.1083986387589633
We shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the Commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the States which consider this service essential to the citizen.	1.3110451691325005
Mr President, I share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the services offered.	1.3100946870888683
But as an entrepreneur myself, I really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of "privatisation" and "liberalisation"!	1.2072833738776416
Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all, but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations.	1.3210521360344611
Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy.	1.3800179752375787
In practice that means the following for the postal services: firstly, priority must be given to employment.	1.2434900323410651
I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right.	1.1583533834721873
Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services.	1.4392013725510309
Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk.	1.0717614981503987
Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union.	1.1750672396079733
So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent.	1.3902253827831643
Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days.	1.2956444937686955
On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying.	1.4115908057457016
We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile.	1.2242320694304683
In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset.	1.4012469996618517
Mr President, the 1997 directive, issued on 21 January 1998, which undertook the partial liberalisation of postal services in Europe, envisaged a revision at a later date, in a rather convoluted manner, indeed, since it was to be dealt with in a Commission proposal by the end of 1998, then decided by 1 January 2000, to come into force finally by 1 January 2003.	1.3893120038069289
Well, for the time being, the revision has not got off the starting block.	1.317491869219046
The two initial phases were not observed which, logically, ought to compromise the third.	0.9225612818845397
My first question is this: surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case?	1.018047089065132
Apparently, they were.	1.3846205037141053
It is really not possible to see how the Commission could by the end of 1998, as stipulated by Article 7 of the directive, have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year.	1.480916732029247
Moreover, the Commission was also not able to provide the implementation report which, according to Article 23, it was to submit by 31 December 2000.	1.542018837405085
Should we complain about this delay?	0.6059243432038198
We do not think so.	0.9290580392112485
If the Commission actually did have convincing evidence in support of taking liberalisation forwards, no one doubts that it would present it without delay.	1.1890600726973883
For its part, the European Parliament, which had fought hard to ensure that the 1997 directive was balanced and respected the requirements of a universal public service, is rather satisfied to see that the compromise it obtained then is proving to be tenable.	1.2906589456383428
In these circumstances, it is quite reasonable for this House to express concern today, asking an oral question which urges the Commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen.	1.2638359720992969
What are the scenarios for development and the potential risks?	1.2857722897200896
The main risk is that the Commission, without adequate justification, might upset the balance which exists now by proposing to go swiftly on to a second phase of liberalisation which would, in some countries, throw off balance the funding of the universal postal service, making it unmanageable.	1.2998547350033773
Today, following the 1997 compromise, Member States can give public monopolies responsibility for the postal service involving mail and parcels whose distribution cost is less than five times the basic tariff, with a weight of less than 350 grammes.	1.22189721485204
It may be supposed, for example, as Commissioner Bolkestein gave us to understand during his hearing on 6 September last year, that the Commission might propose reducing these limits to 50 grams and two and a half times the basic tariff.	1.2207337320408629
This solution would not, in our opinion, be a fair one and indeed the Commission would have no irrefutable figures to support it.	1.3686283437829434
But, unfortunately, we are aware since Seattle that the Commission has no need of a proper assessment of the previous stage before proposing that we go rapidly on to the next stage.	1.4153357260269965
The second scenario, which we prefer: to defer the revision and maintain the current situation until such time as we do actually have a proper, detailed objective study of the effects of the 1997 directive.	1.2716317697213302
In saying that, we are not seeking to protect monopolies whose pernicious effects we are already familiar with, but we wish to be certain that it is possible to combine the gradual evolution of the organisations with maintaining the key principles of public service.	1.3901235992148506
Finally, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group wonders if the idea of foisting unified management rules on the postal services of the fifteen Member States might not be, essentially, flawed.	1.1269030141697527
In France, for example, the unequal distribution of the population over a vast territorial area makes the obligation to provide a public service absolutely indispensable in mail distribution if one wishes to maintain the equality of citizens and social cohesion.	1.0872788769860766
But other countries, in other situations, may have alternative analyses.	1.3962672851764117
In our opinion, each one must be free to make its own organisational choices.	1.2173553648578312
In fact, Article 86 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 90, stipulates that services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition only insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance of the particular tasks assigned to them.	1.1374814202162857
But who defines these tasks?	0.49918592598717987
Who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised?	0.8454397486340078
Our answer is clear: it is not the Commission nor even the Council or the European Parliament, but the people of each Member State by democratic procedures.	1.556753938939956
To wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions.	1.2157496568273778
Mr President, we are currently in the first phase of transposition of Directive 97/67/CE on postal services and I am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered.	1.380378784001311
During Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, my colleague Véronique Mathieu asked for an undertaking "that any new proposals, once these are known, should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted."	1.1388546637884074
What has become of it?	0.6272353209552451
Do we have the results of this impact study?	1.3506001138418307
As you know, we members of the EDD Group, are in favour, along with others, of rural life, maintaining employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service.	1.5770427595432865
Most assuredly I would like to be able to say that the examples I observe every day in my own country and in my own region, a very rural one, convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation.	1.395454822112228
Unfortunately, this is not the case and currently, by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35-hour law, which is purely French, but also by changing the working time criteria, such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400, as previously, in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed.	1.3994569097510607
This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service.	1.1191397845347146
I have here the local paper for my municipality, which reads, "The manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 January 2000" - you can see how topical this is - "the last collection will take place at 3.45 p.m. instead of at 4.30 p.m. as at present."	1.4140456025138233
So you can appreciate why I am afraid of a phase of extensive liberalisation, and a package of measures which will entail a new wave of depopulation.	1.3113956162361466
As you know, in our country, each village has its own local post office or at least a post box, with a collection every day.	1.3826004524959925
The postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents.	1.21649767440128
So he delivers money too, and sometimes even medicines, thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home.	1.318082662694936
If postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way, more post offices will be closed, in the name of this infamous profitability, which is often the cause of rural regression.	1.370993772285751
Once again, Europe is distancing itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants.	0.9942708797773679
They will be told that they are too expensive, without drawing any comparison with other social services such as police and health services but also sports and cultural services, where lack of profitability is scarcely admitted in urban areas.	1.1652011994943878
Everyone is free to choose their lifestyle.	0.7515934625067637
They should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment.	1.1799866851881715
In sport the saying goes, "Do not change a winning team."	1.0087241997206544
Why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory?	1.122333053829948
The universal service will be able to fulfil its social mission only if it retains an area of monopoly enabling it to balance its budget.	1.0087439066348862
We cannot afford to make a mistake, for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance, the firm will know how to tackle it: jobs will be lost, services will be reduced, the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood.	1.3949464875598059
We are told we should change the limit from 350 grammes to 150 grammes, or even 50 grammes.	1.0686692694979407
So be it. But the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies.	1.1818067915936814
So, once again, why not leave things as they are and allow the public service to fund itself and to guarantee the annual excess cost of its operations in the public interest, valued in France, by Senator Larcher, as it happens, at FF 8 billion?	1.342783742916446
If revenue is lost, then public interest operations will be revised and cut, and again it is in rural areas that the most swingeing cuts will be made.	1.4634350946071644
What we should do now, I feel, is wait, particularly until we know the economic and social impact of one phase of liberalisation before taking the risk of destabilising an entire section of our universal public service, which many of our fellow citizens still value highly.	1.4088402608264097
Mr President, I am one of those who agree that it is appropriate that this particular service should be regulated at European level.	1.2436262391848198
If people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have European regulations to govern it.	1.281256516037402
In Ireland some services are provided by companies from outside Ireland, for example, English companies certainly operate there.	0.9866884765368379
But this directive has never been transposed into national law.	0.8615996070842421
It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives.	1.3577772308507208
That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government.	1.1331918077892602
A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators.	0.9938626969864531
But the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the Netherlands they have liberalised, in Germany they have not, yet German companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the Netherlands.	1.323727851203528
This is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the Union.	1.0572567374759345
I come from a rural area.	0.654740272935423
I support the principle of liberalising and the right of everybody to compete and I recognise the benefits that common regulation and liberalisation has brought over the years.	1.137894370843782
For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago.	1.1641342985232923
I remember when people came into this House lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation.	1.0665877156425627
We allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education.	0.9352715388678051
Our older people, even though on social welfare, can enjoy the benefits of travel.	1.2453818186336139
So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living.	0.994169439286833
On the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided.	1.3442715694031728
So, the Commission, in bringing forward their new proposals, must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services.	1.3552500719578686
In rural areas, for many years, even before the Irish Free State came into existence, we sometimes had this service of a post office.	1.2793772425291718
Today, it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that European legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it.	1.3002102792433883
I want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service.	1.3720770346971496
But complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in Ireland.	0.9740000556600139
I want the Commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service.	1.4830123401475954
It should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas.	0.9545037298141658
We must implement what the directive insists on, that the postal service is available to everybody.	1.3402173384850078
Mr President, Commissioner, besides the fact that the postal services doubtless play an extremely important part in providing employment, they are very helpful in the effort to achieve the cohesion we all want so much and which is a basic reason for the European Union' s existence.	1.5046031212910433
As is known, the Commission should already, before the end of 1998, have tabled new proposals for a revision of the Postal Services Directive 97/67, guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service, securing its economic viability, and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved, including postal workers and customers.	1.284636526312712
To that end, the Commission has commissioned studies on the cost of universal services, the consequences of liberalising cross-border mail and direct mail, the consequences of reducing weight and cost limits in the reserved sector, the consequences of liberalising the other phases of the postal process, excluding distribution, and an overall appraisal of the results of those studies.	1.3545513118468322
Mr President, we are therefore wondering, and we ask the Commission - although, of course, Mr Bolkestein is not here, but Mr Monti is a man of many parts and I think he may have a view on this: should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each, and I repeat, on each one of the European Union' s Member States?	1.6458856586338217
The postal services in Greece, Great Britain, the Netherlands or Belgium are, of course, all different.	1.3672275308670425
With liberalisation, how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own, Greece, with its particular geographical features and its numerous, small but inhabited islands?	1.172281681939784
How can a universal service provider in my country survive with the liberalisation of cross-border mail which amounts to approximately 25%, as opposed to less than 5% in other countries?	1.3396275252420695
How are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office' s business abroad?	1.1808717006665799
We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject.	1.0217682145202438
It will most certainly be necessary, we say, because of the technological developments that simplify this transfer and thereby make it more profitable, to determine the further gradual and controlled liberalisation by setting weight and price limits.	1.2322585240138924
But what will those limits be?	0.744658064901069
Are we naively to grant 'freelance' enterprises the right to operate selectively and therefore circumvent the weight limit very easily since the content of letters cannot, of course, be checked?	1.0510802091555067
In any event, we ask the Commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals, having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the Member States.	1.2755532530325449
It is self-evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself, but only a means towards improving services.	1.0513889245644423
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the planned liberalisation of the traditional national postal services raises the inevitable question as to what the postal services will consider their core business to be in the future. In other words, what will the postal services be prepared to do themselves, what will they want to do together in international cooperation and what will they no longer provide?	1.3172020366196444
This question should be answered in light of the fact that the age-old monopoly has de facto been undermined by all kinds of courier companies and by technological developments, such as fax and e-mail.	1.0762836233192816
But then again, the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment.	1.0951706803558603
Past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an undesired effect.	0.8396413513701342
I would remind you of the fact that the Belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know-how and expertise from disappearing from the company.	1.1399614810986616
Once again, the point of discussion in the liberalisation of the postal services will no doubt be a reduction in the workforce.	1.2192460976629658
One should, however, be very aware of the fact that if people are encouraged to apply for voluntary redundancy, the company will primarily lose those people who already work under pressure or who can easily find employment elsewhere, in other words, they are often the people which the company in question needs.	1.2901106171425483
In my opinion, it would be a sign of well-thought-out human resource management if the Commission were to share a number of these concerns, so as to ensure that a sensitive sector such as the postal service is liberalised with minimum impact on social conditions.	1.201752251081017
Mr President, postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so, given their importance.	1.485713353419063
Only last week, in the UK parliament at Westminster the newly-elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners, Plaid Cymru, the party of Wales, made his maiden speech on that subject.	1.289970789563077
The Scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices, especially in rural areas, play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities.	1.131347004219422
Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services.	1.1494175305848506
Post office outlets in Scotland, as we have heard, handle much more than just mail delivery.	1.1089942087755131
Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents, local taxes and so on. But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts, so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened.	1.238957471528385
If a rural post office closes, usually with the only local shop attached, then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result.	1.091725200978653
Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems, governments, and the Commission too, should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon, providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents.	1.185559814018083
Mr President, the task of the post office is to ensure that, every day, the post is delivered everywhere, be it in the city or in remote, rural areas, at the same tariff.	1.297142771060176
For 150 years, the postal services have been a public affair and, as such, just like public transport and the power supply, a core task of the national governments.	1.6599623400198928
Such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote.	0.8008270140991086
They are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs.	0.9632880377939563
I once heard a Christian Democratic politician make the following comment in a Dutch village: "The postal service belongs to us all; taking it away from us is tantamount to theft" .	1.0880538695840416
The existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors.	1.175573155894772
The newcomers are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices.	0.9748084520641199
They can be the cheapest for a while only by means of a drop in quality for their customers and employees.	1.0798597782775776
Such companies have always been around, but they used to be banned, whereas these days they are being heralded as progress.	1.3416345551420141
The end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices.	0.9877931539543329
They will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages.	0.9221155028523346
They will often do fewer home deliveries, charge more for retaining post during the holidays, close down a large number of the post office branches and, ultimately, the tariffs for the individual will sharply increase, at which point the only parties which will stand to benefit from this type of practice will be companies which conclude collective agreements at a lower tariff.	1.1196694634059647
It is time we stopped this trend.	1.079202547284131
A fault confessed is half redressed.	0.5403948666824847
We are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled.	0.908683179886743
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, people used to be summoned to demonstrations by letter or telegram; nowadays this is done by e-mail and via websites!	1.0707406299067035
Incidentally, many thanks to Mr Scharping, the Chairman of the European Social Democrats, for withdrawing the call to take part in demonstrations in Austria from his homepage and therefore not advising anarchists in favour of violent action to go to Vienna tomorrow.	1.4787223074365452
It is clear that electronic mail, electronic commerce is going to become extremely important in the future.	1.0682188506700212
I also see this as offering special potential for the existing postal service.	0.9911578218416504
We know that until the year 2002 it will not be possible to fill some 1.2 million jobs in the field of electronic commerce because we do not have the skilled workers needed for this market.	1.199996195286793
I believe that this opens up very extensive employment potential in the postal administration in particular, which can prepare its existing staff for this very interesting challenge by means of training and further training measures.	1.3723683559502269
Of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage, because they are so densely distributed throughout Europe.	1.1168727432244057
Even the tiniest village has a post office and in future e-commerce will make far more use of the post because many people will order goods by e-mail and through websites and also send bills and so forth by that means. That is why the physical handling of these transactions will also become increasingly important.	1.2209510816542664
The collection, sorting, transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension.	0.9091366969373922
I believe that in future we must seize this opportunity.	1.0901814083859718
As politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests.	0.7467522098607157
We want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid.	1.0937866324364376
That faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services.	1.014263582164362
We should take a look - thinking also of benchmarking - at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector.	1.1633257699831816
This transparency is also very important for the unions, for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service?	1.1346935940367833
I think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice, fairness and solidarity.	1.175682635186201
But I also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive.	1.295778327981869
We should define the universal service precisely, establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender.	0.8688702570442752
In rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost-effective, I believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent tendering conditions, so that all the market forces, and of course the existing postal services too, can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies.	1.4217544274582568
I believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system.	1.2148927977221295
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, postal services, just like any European public service, contribute to the social cohesion of Community territory under the terms of Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	1.126014875404037
By equalising tariffs, i.e. treating citizens and economic operators on a basis of strict equality with regard to the cost of the service, by meeting the obligation to provide a universal service, while complying with the requirement for quality of service, postal services reflect the concern which we must have to ensure equality between different regions and the people resident in them.	1.291242155703837
They also play a major role in maintaining links between people.	0.8783398840790958
As has been pointed out here on many occasions, is the postman not in fact the last point of contact in depopulated districts or divided communities, whether these are areas that are isolated geographically or the problem districts in our towns and cities?	1.321762634061059
Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service, which decided, for instance, to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas.	1.3246137181322022
Without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors, European public postal services today employ one and a half million operatives whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical, untrammelled liberalisation.	0.9725078061375911
The European Parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs.	1.1445412836148876
We may congratulate ourselves on this, but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is today being excluded from the main decision-making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in Europe.	1.5172830257118775
Indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the Commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 January 1999.	1.589068012949088
That resolution called for the European Parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved.	1.047206412187851
These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation, not just on the economic organisation of the market, but also in terms of its human and social aspects.	1.2350097039199261
The delays in the Commission' s work will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question.	1.1077625985903976
By defining a sector reserved for public postal services, on the basis of weight and price limits, the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases.	1.1401225092131053
The sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services.	1.0267854296029975
Against a background of globalisation, where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion, we must here, as a matter of urgency, reiterate our commitment to European public service, whether it be, today, the postal service or, tomorrow, the rail service or, the day after that, the health service.	1.3878950325562687
Mr President, I rise as other Scottish Members of this House, representatives of Scotland, to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts.	1.22117087748463
The postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout Europe and not least in Scotland.	1.225972997629439
It would be a disaster if action were deliberately, or even inadvertently, taken which had the effect of damaging that.	1.2395008020008522
I do not believe that it is anybody' s intention to do so.	1.057382275513367
I do not believe that the Commission has set out to make war upon the islands of Scotland or Greece.	1.3897375657213786
But they might accidentally do great damage.	0.5984108766810768
The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place.	1.0141826572853692
If too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service, it would become uneconomical to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate.	1.1894926453737682
The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability.	0.7480817080729709
The message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the House to the Commission today is that the Commission should tread warily.	1.4285648509194675
The Commission should not, for example, take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to, as some have suggested, as low as 50 grammes.	1.4579052169131586
On the contrary, it should proceed cautiously.	1.2092562228491768
I imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances.	0.8975714833679963
The solidarity and cohesion of people all over Europe depend on the thought that you can post a letter anywhere and it will be delivered anywhere else, at an affordable stamp price.	1.2121587433096497
Stand by universality and affordability!	0.4232228959132205
Mr President, the only way to guarantee a high-quality universal postal service is to keep this as a public service.	1.4613625019865424
A universal service offering high-quality postal services at affordable prices throughout the country forms the basis for the operation of the whole postal system and must lead to a uniform nationwide tariff.	1.1397288784476332
This service must therefore be kept public.	0.817652895480917
This is the only way to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators.	1.2699613243177472
However, further to the directive on common rules for Community postal services, the Commission has undertaken studies which have not been forwarded to the European Parliament. We are therefore unaware of the impacts of the directive' s application on either the level of service provided to the people or the current European postal operators in terms of both economics and employment.	1.5439101104072885
In our opinion, the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted, including its timetable.	1.3782579401370596
Any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications, with the objective always being to guarantee a high-quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs.	1.1985387132837888
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to support this proposal on principle while asking right at the outset whether the previous speaker' s statement that on the one hand we need an innovative and highly effective and competitive service while on the other hand this service should be a public service, is not a contradiction in terms.	1.360302694773223
I think ours is a different approach!	0.8191010824541364
European policy has liberalised monopoly markets - energy, telecommunications and air transport - and the target, the focus, was always the consumer.	1.3764172698274348
The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services.	1.2027448180527023
I think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs.	1.0101139760072646
He does not need a government to do so, or a parliament, nor does he need a Commission to do so!	1.5616015964716528
The postal market is limping along behind and, sadly, we have wasted valuable time here.	1.1848395615579395
I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends.	1.1825252979281586
I am thinking here of the very sound words of Mr Rübig, who also talked about e-commerce.	1.2886340082813652
That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges.	1.1063213934535496
I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market.	1.025036135418584
It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy.	0.7870983660463698
We should seize that opportunity, for the citizen keeps asking, why do we have Europe?	1.1898620103922901
These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe.	0.964090527183627
I am glad Mr Monti, the Commissioner for competition, is here today in person, for he is pursuing an excellent policy.	1.5724068974333687
And here I want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - Parliament and the Commission must consider where to draw limits to competition.	1.6429480222126223
We are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy, and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible.	1.4164105536393707
Yet I believe that, as this debate has shown, we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas.	1.6156706799161273
So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction, together with Parliament.	1.1892405508097865
I have mentioned the example of social services before: nowadays we can reduce everything to attracting the customer, including the pensioner in an old people' s home, and the question is whether we want to subject all that to competition, whether that is the right course.	1.4553850183820927
I believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits, the positive aspects of competition.	1.2511591870523495
For competition is not an end in itself; it is there to serve of the citizen, the consumer, which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it.	1.4736674238543253
Mr President, liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology.	1.2517490732082794
I emphasise the word 'could' , and that is if it is done well and with care.	1.258941050206442
Wrongly done, the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality.	1.0981261079928986
Social problems will increase, interregional disparities will grow, and competition will occur only in those areas where the economy is strongest, areas where there are more people and, especially, more businesses.	1.3571983947469453
On the other hand, the losers will be the remote areas and their inhabitants, and the people that will not benefit from the new services.	1.3473095007911682
Before we decide whether to liberalise postal services, there should be much more discussion about how we can make the present services more flexible and more customer-friendly, and how funding systems can facilitate the investments called for by the new technology.	1.25434310530902
I think this policy has been reasonably successful in Finland, as testified by the present public system.	1.2762870793853829
I think, however, that common rules have to be applied to this sector, so that we do not find ourselves at some stage somewhere out in the Wild West, or even the Wild East. We need rules in common based on equality and the principle of a public service.	1.4125097782155145
Mr President, a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service.	1.4619839421321046
It would be obscene to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers, millions of service users, in a great rush.	1.2327922808259062
But, despite the unfavourable opinion of ten European postal services, a form of unacknowledged privatisation is brewing in the corridors of the Commission.	1.084990674291316
By lowering the price/weight threshold reserved for public postal services and by liberalising mailshots or cross-border post, the second directive may offer the most profitable sectors to the competitive sector.	1.150597600250714
Postal services may then keep whatever does not whet the appetite of the private operators.	0.8588290497788091
Whether total or partial, privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse.	0.8406493634024463
Just the example of the privatisation of British rail services should suffice to prove the extent to which opting for maximum profit is antipathetic to maintaining a socially useful service.	0.9276664448856508
Instead of fighting amongst themselves, public postal services should cooperate, take staff on and guarantee decent, stable working conditions, while meeting the needs of service users in terms of both post delivery and savings bank services.	1.1899002309329427
Mr President, today' s debate comes under the sign of the snail, not because I ate such excellent snails here in Strasbourg yesterday but because the snail is a symbol of slow progress.	1.2008700237343983
One example of this slow progress is the way the Commission is proceeding.	1.4209977719207225
This study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last.	1.200886784359016
I am most grateful to the Commissioner for his plain talking today and I would ask the Commission to force the pace now.	1.372876469376971
Today' s debate makes it quite clear that Parliament wants more emphasis on speed, not speed at the expense of quality, but then slowness alone does not mean quality either.	1.3617936298728308
This brings me to my second point, namely the snail as symbol of our postal services.	1.1616599088483481
What has happened over the past 200 years is that the time it takes for a letter to go from Munich to Brussels has increased fivefold.	1.195095931415423
Letters to Strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner, but it still takes far too long.	1.1795325259094893
That means that since the days of mail-coaches and taxis, we have seen a steady decline in the quality of services.	1.1878503316617204
It may be true, as was said here, that today we have new possibilities, e.g. electronic possibilities such as e-mail, but on the other hand we must realise that as ever the ordinary letter continues to play a very, very important role and that, in particular, young families, the elderly and many others continue to rely very heavily on conventional mail.	1.3965173213409836
So I believe that in relation to conventional mail we must do what Mr Radwan described in such excellent terms, namely encourage competition on the one hand and on the other, define the limits.	1.2708868698581233
But what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite!	1.3694275869094825
By embarking on the kind of pseudo and partial privatisations we have also witnessed in Germany, we have combined the drawbacks of the state monopoly with the drawbacks of privatisation, which is really not the purpose of the whole exercise!	1.3518759908469598
Some speakers have referred to the social importance of the postman. Let me add to that, the importance of the post offices.	1.5196326622237928
They have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas.	0.6418748991929945
I come from Munich, a very densely populated urban conglomeration, but we have the same problem there.	1.5694433924648594
One urban district post office after another is being closed down.	0.7909321426923072
We have a disproportionately large number of old people in these large cities, who are becoming increasingly lonely with the decline in the number of retail shops.	1.2017661233831338
That is why we must define certain minimum standards here too and realise that it is important to provide the necessary services for the people.	1.410450783272379
For if there is only one letter box left in the inner city of Munich where the mail is collected again in the evening, that reflects a rapid decline in quality, while at the same time prices are sometimes rising, which is something else we must note.	1.2422522359193964
So, yes to liberalisation, but let us also think about the limits to liberalisation, rapidly create reasonable conditions in Europe and submit the appropriate study to the Commission.	1.2178902492614774
I would hope that in future the symbol of European postal policy will no longer be the snail but that our post will finally be dispatched post-haste.	1.1601261470029491
That is a term that harks back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed.	1.1593524248288105
Like Mr Radwan, I am glad that Commissioner Monti is here rather than Commissioner Bolkestein because I believe that he can explain to us certain aspects relating to competition.	1.2866250993759998
I do not know if Mr Monti is aware of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of last week, 10 February, which recognised the possibility of the German postal service being in a dominant position as a result of its holding a postal monopoly.	1.4663735401808689
Competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation - before 1 January 2003 - because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates.	1.3573755174797975
This has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations.	0.9807164804981139
In the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the European Union, what consequences would that have for free competition?	1.3102586225776174
For the moment, it appears that, in the only country where liberalisation has taken place - Sweden - there has been a 59% increase in the price of postal services.	1.4575890306513672
We do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place.	1.2775641406235487
It is likely that postal liberalisation will lead to greater cost differences between countries, which will no doubt have implications for competition, which will not only affect the cost of the postal service but also the establishment of installations.	1.418951764557906
For example, there are currently companies which set up in Holland because the postal charges are lower than in Germany and the same may happen in the future.	1.2338284273983233
I therefore wonder whether the Commission' s package on postal liberalisation will include the preservation of free competition, because it is very possible that - as has happened in most sectors in the Community today - it will lead to concentrations of large companies which will cancel out the benefits of this theoretical liberalisation.	1.2669063333184787
At the moment, in services which are not theoretically liberalised - as is the case with national postal services - there is a basic form of liberalisation, which is agreed within the framework of the Universal Postal Union, allowing for lower tariffs.	1.5020296254936407
In a service which is theoretically liberalised, free competition may disappear as a result of the concentration of the service amongst large companies abusing their dominant position, agreements between companies and other similar circumstances.	1.1374701971023162
I would therefore advise Commissioner Monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation, taking strict account of free competition, because I believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future.	1.299857142213104
My prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services.	1.0377274813386297
Mr President, the postal service is not a normal service provider like a hairdresser' s or a fitness centre.	1.1713760282601382
For us in Finland, a sparsely populated country, a visit to the post office is a social event.	1.4610260654970961
In the world of networking, the mail service is the most democratic of all networks.	1.4707948864780038
It creates and maintains interpersonal relationships.	0.5697166571308885
The common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the marketeers.	1.1828164249381559
For us in the north it will mean that the EU will be destroying the social infrastructure.	1.2585942448301977
Commissioner Monti, the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships: postal services must be improved, not run down.	1.3598887826655686
Only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone' s reach in society.	0.8643350767594168
The post office is democracy.	0.7126730591811147
It is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies.	0.8691472321869522
Telecommunications costs have risen as a consequence of companies being bought and sold and marketing costs accounting for more than 50% of companies' turnover.	1.0196427956692278
Democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office.	1.2282628752874518
It is particularly appropriate that Mr Monti is responding to this debate because the great conundrum with postal services is how to square an open market and free and fair competition with providing a service which is universally available to all, even in the remotest and least inhabited region of the European Union.	1.1823006353781458
In the hills and glens of Scotland and the rural borders and central belt, on the beautiful but fragile islands of the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland, there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service.	1.120630254280374
Yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services, like all service industries, are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open, even international, competition.	1.3187168846850468
I would suggest that there is a solution.	1.1614647362349497
It is already employed widely in the transport sector.	1.0455252643319617
Air routes, ferry routes, train routes, bus routes, within and to these remoter areas are put out to tender. The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract.	1.1038421319203975
Let us call this a negative tender franchise.	0.8276517479408315
This permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly-supported but fully transparent franchise system.	0.8033191606589403
Why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner?	1.0430262270124164
The lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time.	0.9044344360085657
Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender?	0.9428132492050001
It would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body, local, regional or national - probably under overall EU supervision - to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose.	1.3631698838864956
Otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace.	1.13319339560991
Mr President, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Member of this House from Scotland to rise to speak in this debate.	1.336783354714494
That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services.	1.3544981528050282
Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States.	0.8072574781683588
It has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road, sometimes served poorly by public transport, sometimes not at all.	1.0960920462351984
Such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities, such as a school, a post office and a shop.	1.1596537894349501
It is on the last two that the elderly, in particular, depend.	1.3521045024628844
Often they are located together, each service being made more viable by the existence of the other.	1.17375701387907
Scotland also has many island communities, some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries.	1.0729150157978689
It has been calculated that the actual cost of carrying a letter from Edinburgh to the Central Highlands is about ten times that of carrying the same letter across London.	1.018686378242711
And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged.	1.0826284243302833
The more remote the community, the greater the difference becomes.	1.1612007711642165
That is the measure of the problem.	1.097780539113193
It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service.	1.2935490695768765
It is for all our remote and island communities, no matter where in the European Union they are situated, and not just for the people of Scotland, that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide.	1.4894516626159595
. Mr President, I consider it a privilege that I am replacing my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, on the occasion of such a high-quality debate on postal services.	1.293566316348258
I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein.	1.097325296621531
May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament.	1.032612058968905
Some Members, like Mr Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal.	1.107348555995085
Others believe that it is not so bad after all, if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation.	1.4431549281957246
This is, for example, the position expressed by Mr Berthu.	1.0944555780283962
The Commission' s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the Commission, of which I am sure Parliament is not totally unaware.	1.6424835644949052
But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made.	1.3596399510344408
It is Commissioner Bolkestein' s intention to present such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year.	1.2519952856777383
The scheduled date of 1 January 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible.	1.1517598043640325
The proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service, to which I will come back in a second.	1.3530350411272327
As regards the existing directive and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive.	1.3151457513690574
A number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence.	1.0507369994680362
The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003.	1.0248492865979122
Further liberalisation will occur afterwards.	0.6121544891519711
In some areas competition is already taking place, as in the parcels sector and in the express services.	1.2456982589576395
The quality of services has, generally speaking, improved, in particular in regard to cross-border activity.	1.3382045389853026
The quality of services, which is so relevant to consumers, was a main concern of all speakers, some of whom, like Mr Rübig, were very explicit on this point.	1.4865716332954506
The experiences in countries where liberalisation is more advanced such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, prove that when liberalisation takes place in an orderly way, the quality of service may be raised as a result of higher-quality service requirements imposed by the national regulations and their follow-up.	1.2333615250785865
So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality.	1.5058888956149312
Frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on-going standardisation of the measurement of the quality of service also contributes, as these standards will better reflect actual performance.	1.0981103954885973
This will allow for meaningful bench-marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent operator as a result of the combined pressure by regulators, competitors and customers.	0.9485923073389463
We can see in the incumbent operators, in public post offices, a change of culture that I believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers' needs continues.	1.3015787470955862
The concerns expressed in this Parliament this morning by honourable Members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the Commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal.	1.3083246085211873
That proposal will fully take into account the need to ensure universality of service, the development of efficient safeguards for consumers, and the creation of a climate which would be favourable to new jobs - not to fewer jobs - in the framework of a progressive, gradual evolution.	1.470663126565417
The issue of universal service was mentioned by Mrs Isler Béguin, by Mr Miller, whom I thank for his personal message, and by many others.	1.4069491869135806
We are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion, especially in the sparsely populated rural areas, one of which has been particularly strongly and overwhelmingly represented in the debate this morning.	1.2766141218418263
We believe that the universal service is a pillar and I am sure that my colleague will be able to provide reassurances to the appropriate parliamentary committee.	1.370861875819051
Mrs Gillig, but others like Mr Markov and Mr Ésclope, voiced concerns about employment.	1.138808412892178
Experience in other sectors show a sort of U-curve pattern: a phase of reduction in employment starts just before liberalisation takes place, as, of course, the incumbent prepares itself to be competitive; then a second phase of steady employment, as new jobs in newcomer operators balance further potential employment reductions; finally, a third phase of net job creation, both in the incumbent and new operators as the benefits of liberalisation reach users and the market develops more quickly.	1.205811872797787
In the postal sector the first phase is already in progress, as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation.	1.32733181530814
The new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment.	1.2469637713950756
On the availability of the studies, - a point raised by Mr Staes and others - copies of each of the studies were handed to Parliament in September 1999.	1.2846126377257059
They have all been available on the Commission' s Internet website since August 1999 and the Commission is willing to provide copies to anybody who is interested.	1.100596918958236
The studies have been the object of some criticism, especially on the part of the public postal services.	1.140456770320866
I am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data.	0.9851850489481443
This was no surprise, since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection.	1.1632756931680681
Does that not say a lot about management ability?	0.9981980602078033
No single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties.	1.0967979019201106
Nevertheless, Mr Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision-making process.	1.2544663502679343
I finally come to three interventions about a subject I am supposed to know better than postal services, that is competition.	1.1241067882748543
Mr Purvis, I found your methodologically provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth exploring.	1.0567569295219743
Mr Medina Ortega, I am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise, through unchecked concentration, to private operators.	1.460028984118853
This applies both to the post and other sectors.	0.988761006392749
If I can provide one example of this sort of vigilance, it is the case of Deutsche Post where, following complaints and an action before the court, the Commission initiated a formal state aid procedure in July.	1.4923463020185195
We have just received the reply of the German Government to the observations made.	1.2454762425806114
The state aid procedure covers the question of cross-subsidisation between monopoly letter services and commercial business parcel activities as well as the financing of Deutsche Post' s numerous recent acquisitions.	1.1308740200701184
I will not go into the details due to lack of time, but this is perhaps one illustration of the fact that the Commission does not stop its work as liberalisation progresses.	1.2835857377341933
In a sense this is where its work begins.	1.1370210606836024
Finally, Mr Radwan, of course, there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition.	1.346103227776694
In particular, if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest, where a Member State defines a mission of public service, it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition.	1.4107510526731202
I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition.	1.2147298741013315
That concept I reject firmly, because competition is there for the citizens, and for them alone.	1.5022382822716853
Most companies hate competition.	0.4421284384677081
Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens, their economic interest and for their liberty.	1.1844628535806625
The examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in telephony services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this.	0.9629960436352656
I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday, in the appropriate committee, more competently and in much more detail.	1.445878679931915
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.47513528222732565
Pursuant to Rule 42(5), I have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate.	1.41497726087802
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
We shall now proceed to the vote.	0.16783221255831815
(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE	0.8849385399606096
We voted in favour of the resolution because we received a request to this effect from a French postal service trade union which was looking to obtain, in the event of a favourable vote, an additional time frame in which to defend employees.	1.3162697937445176
This does not mean that we approve the entire contents, which are too vague and which leave out the main concern.	1.294092593590756
The policy undertaken by the European institutions and by national governments, especially the French government, is a retrograde policy, counter to the interests of both the service users, i.e. the great majority of the population, and the postal service workers.	1.4866955415858605
Postal services must continue to be public services.	0.8670254497102731
All people, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions.	1.2653358588368513
In organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability, and private firms must not be authorised to amass private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities.	1.1820515072810005
Consequently, the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of Europe must keep their monopoly of this service.	1.4086971573404168
In order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the European Union level, it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices, reducing the number of deliveries and overworking postal staff.	1.25047104663322
The post office and, more generally, all public services must, on the other hand, recruit additional staff.	1.2074468596344123
Such jobs are unquestionably useful, and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe.	1.1046140786877334
Mr President, personally I voted in favour of this resolution, because the essential thing is that the European Parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation.	1.5774263106454387
If we dismantle the public service, this would be very serious, and we wish to know what are the Commission' s intentions.	1.6189967098019336
Saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate.	1.034776427320428
People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so.	1.3262790284311643
Postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service.	1.0099179185629539
Occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day.	1.244291050142064
We can salute them, these postmen who, whatever the weather, sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone.	1.200968780474521
Dismantling the postal service, the local communication service, would be a serious mistake and we would be unable to maintain the principle of the equality of all citizens.	1.4526714697979626
Profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion.	0.8853227360582326
Mr President, I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives.	1.3814781962347238
Several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman, particularly in mountain communities.	1.225253971082836
I wholeheartedly agree.	0.44014592694619137
However, it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints.	1.4559451316164138
In my own country, Italy, there are some 200 000 postal workers who cost the state approximately ITL 50 million a year per capita, or EUR 25 000, that is, a total cost of around EUR 5 million.	1.1757073470237598
Liberalisation of postal services would mean that the state could give each pensioner an extra ITL 10 million a year so that a million pensioners would see their pensions doubled.	1.019661836352952
That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman.	0.6829405460488946
Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on European postal services with all the more satisfaction since it reiterates once again the position I have always defended in this House, which is the need for a high quality universal service, particularly ensuring this service in the least populated regions and rural regions, and there are some even in my small country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.	1.4952447179453
In these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities, as Mr Posselt explained so clearly, post offices and postmen have an almost socio-cultural role, I might say, which goes beyond merely delivering mail.	1.3367359594219184
I know that this service is unprofitable.	1.0583274726571306
It would perhaps be less costly to make a fax or email available to isolated houses or villages.	0.9598972887915453
In principle, I am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies, whether in water, gas, electricity, telephone, satellite, cable or any other services.	1.0611627915627329
Nonetheless, liberalisation, which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service, especially in the telephone sector, must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears, when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money.	1.4591089095240002
If they cannot be obliged to provide what the state monopoly was able to guarantee, particularly thanks to its obligation to provide a universal service, then the public service must be protected.	1.3109937431865164
I feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service, even if our post offices operate like businesses.	1.2250392413992621
They clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email.	1.2383877304685273
.	-0.0
(FR) Here indeed is a sector which has highlighted the limitations and serious deficiencies of liberalisation.	1.0224373327716987
I am not, personally, a blinkered militant in favour of monopolies, whether public or private, but when I see the results achieved by private firms in this sector I am reinforced in my position as a defender of public service!	1.389827954527425
If liberalisation continues in this area too, then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service.	1.4891747749870492
For who can believe for one moment that private firms, motivated only by profit, will continue to provide services in high-cost areas unless the costs are borne by the already disadvantaged inhabitants who are not, therefore, in a position to take advantage of the service.	1.2319258555741992
I should add that today, at a time when Europe is revealing itself and is proving to be incapable of opposing the inclusion of Fascists in a government within the European Union, it is no longer acceptable to have an ultraliberalism which destroys public services foisted on us in the name of this same Europe.	1.2035519251170659
I am a European and even a federalist.	1.2510910354621443
To achieve this I was ready and I am ready to make certain sacrifices, but not just anything! Most especially, I am no longer ready to accept the formation of a liberal single market if Europe is not at the same time capable of defending the values on which it is based and which, in the 1960s, made me a committed European!	1.462273780597093

Resumption of the session	0.13474910339249976
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 18 February 2000.	0.826632055101068
Statement by the President	0.5336908263689515
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 22 February, ETA struck again in a brutal attack in Spain with the murder of Fernando Buesa Blanco, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party of Vizcaya and the spokesman of the Socialist Party of the Basque Parliament, and Jorge Díez Elorza, his bodyguard.	1.32352717267467
The same day, I conveyed my own and the European Parliament' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims' families.	1.0281324065033528
These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy.	0.8006698670456532
I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society.	0.7794840465137943
The rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based.	1.3317348088153376
Terrorism, whatever form it takes, is unacceptable.	1.3687438250321502
In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain.	1.2726337527375093
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe one minute' s silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge Díez Elorza.	1.0418420426034392
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)	0.3436815902905627
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I want to thank you for your statement last Tuesday and for your words today in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco.	1.0085412356849826
He was a member of the Basque regional parliament, spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government.	1.4141064113418036
Madam President, the best tribute that my Group and this House can pay to Fernando Buesa is to take on board his vision, as a European, of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.	1.5336905397027851
The following is a translated extract from his autobiography. 'We are in Europe.	1.1075073416246992
Anyone of my age - I am 54 - can remember their grandparents' era and their parents' era and, of course, is living in the current era. We can also see into the era in which our children will live.	1.4360059438465436
In my grandparents' time, it took several days to travel from Vitoria to Seville.	1.1204874454310565
Now you can go from Vitoria to Copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane.	0.8201267064858224
Today, at the end of the 20th century, a single market is operating in Europe in which we will soon be using a single currency.	1.3792171934274047
We can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within Spain or even within the Basque Country.	0.953470574767179
We are building a vast European area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically.	1.003074460506255
This process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and, what is more, desirable.	1.1803653464270691
The public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation.	1.3040100251967948
In a debate within the Socialist Party on the Irish process, someone said: "In the end, the key to the Irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought: does it really matter whether we are Irish or British?	1.2000440526741494
Everyone can be what they want to be because, if Ireland and Britain are both in the European Union, there is no point in killing each other for being Irish or British.	1.3246566592710458
What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function?"	1.0576641701037863
We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question. Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European?	1.1847229679362647
We have talked a lot about what it is to be Basque, but a Basque today dresses like a Dane and reads the same things as a British person.	1.1681334521690891
If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis, as is already happening, and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating, why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish?'	1.3927050233193636
Fernando Buesa also said the following, which everyone in Ireland has probably thought. 'If we are killing each other for no reason - and this was happening in Ireland because there were paramilitary groups on all sides - we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the Basque Country too.	1.367548063042207
What difference does it make to be Basque? Surely it is all the same thing.	1.1135934772447964
You can be what you want to be.	1.1496274700253952
If, in the future, economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the European arena, there is no point killing or dying for being Basque or Spanish' .	1.232785266874469
May he rest in peace.	0.535251031331896
(Loud applause)	0.04062958545577951
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa, an elected representative of the Basque people, and Jorge Díez, a member of the Basque police force. We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party.	1.3299194012978826
In recent times, in this House, we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe.	1.3521505167813788
It does not matter what banner these come under because, in the end, they are all different expressions of the same thing.	1.1900063459761885
Faced with these, we democrats cannot resign ourselves to the peace of the dead.	1.1798338148742609
On the contrary, we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the Basque Country is the abyss which separates those who kill, and those who support and express understanding for the latter, from the vast majority of the Basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom.	1.2639518362639324
(Loud applause)	0.04062958545577951
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 February in Vitoria which took the lives of the socialist MP and spokesman in the Basque parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez.	1.0302005813954163
In a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the European Union, it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended, provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice, freedom and economic and social progress on which the Union is based. The transgression of these principles is simply not acceptable, as clearly indicated in the Treaties.	1.416864702223962
There is no justification in our society for terrorist acts such as the one which took the lives of Fernando Buesa and Jorge Díez, particularly when the former was a freely elected representative of the Basque people.	1.2648388416610534
We pray that these are the last victims in a process which, as you said, Madam President, has seen much barbarism. We pray that a way forward can be found which will allow the Basque people to live together in peace.	1.489610161460328
Madam President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I must add my voice to those of my colleagues who have expressed their grief at the truly perverse and cruel outrage which has occurred in the Basque Country. We send our condolences to the families of the victims and emphatically condemn these acts which have been going on for so long and which must stop.	1.2115739331062678
The terrorist organisation ETA has, in its time, killed police officers and soldiers.	1.3244807417037767
It has placed a bomb in a supermarket and killed men, women and children.	0.8643113297653071
In the streets of Madrid it has killed a general, Quintana Lacaci, who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981.	1.1876589546654683
It has assassinated the spokesman of the Popular Party in the town council of San Sebastián, Gregorio Ordóñez.	0.8428701802910449
It has been to the lecture room of the university professor in Constitutional Law, Francisco Tomás y Valiente, and killed him in cold blood. Now, just a few days ago, in the same odious way in which it assassinated Admiral Blanco, it has killed the socialist MP and spokesman in the Vitoria parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez, of the Basque police force.	1.3067446045783497
ETA must be condemned. However, those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned.	1.1569601034863728
There is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road.	1.20279370122623
We must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties, whether they are national or nationalist, and no matter how pro- or anti-European they are.	1.3374197948687492
It is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident.	1.144306237603587
All European democrats in this House must join together to send a message to the Basque Country that it is time to put an end to the division and killing. It is time to share the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.	1.2950670045628807
This, Madam President, is the only way forward which we therefore fully support.	1.3567664437634919
Madam President, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it.	1.2086637604494912
For the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy, but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy, in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others, democracy and democratic life.	1.4846693228232626
So, Madam President, maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance.	1.2447910063353225
Why does Parliament not meet in all the countries of the European Union and show that it rejects terrorism?	1.2731058991991284
Let us make ourselves heard!	0.6988684195843365
We are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg.	1.0510223865727428
Let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words, but a demonstration of our actual political commitment.	1.22933117727162
Madam President, as a member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and also as an MEP for the Basque Nationalist Party, I must firstly categorically condemn the cowardly attack which took the lives of a Basque police officer, Jorge Díez Elorza, and the Basque MP and former vice-president, Fernando Buesa.	1.2930172834009321
Secondly, we send our deepest condolences to their families, their socialist colleagues, the Basque parliament and the Basque police force. We also want to express our solidarity and heartfelt sympathy.	1.3987548314179634
Thirdly, we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which, by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people, not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people.	1.3559442349284465
Fourthly, we express our repulsion at the fact that this dual assassination was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the Basque Country.	1.1559816934140705
Fifthly, we again call on the Spanish and French leaders and politicians to show the same tolerance as in the United Kingdom and Ireland in order to resolve the current Basque conflict with something more than police measures which, on their own, cannot bring about the peace which we all desire.	1.47399648202417
Sixthly and finally, we reaffirm that ETA' s terrorism and violence must end. ETA must stop hijacking the will of the Basque people who must be allowed to decide on their future freely and without violent coercion.	1.1500091518876068
Just three months ago I took the floor in this House to congratulate the Irish and British people on their success in reaching the Northern Ireland settlement, as many other colleagues did.	1.4454615782206337
In Northern Ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured - too many families shattered.	1.266575902021963
So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country.	1.2317982449479044
We, Euskal Herritarrok, are convinced that a definitive solution to the present struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation with no limited agenda.	1.2008934620369518
Before 20 January last, during nineteen months, the only killing we witnessed in the Kingdom of Spain was that of José Luis Geresta, member of ETA, in March 1999.	1.3951033046246
In spite of that and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, including arrests of ETA negotiators with the Spanish government' s agreement, ETA honoured its unilateral ceasefire.	1.236155367480503
Then, last November, before the ceasefire was over, the Spanish Government spokesman, Mr Piqué, declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the Basque country.	1.3152984817997477
We, Euskal Herritarrok, have regretted many times the loss of human lives.	1.0282812994245292
We share with all the Basque citizens the sufferings of our people.	0.8781280774310114
We are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the Basque country.	1.028037159430956
Twenty years have passed since the Northern Ireland question was first raised in this Parliament.	0.9218630418487712
May I ask: Quousque tandem - Noiz arte?	0.9688778274540689
Thank you, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect.	1.2359896722681984
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	0.4510321946745718
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.	0.7162302620677699
Are there any comments?	0.1337831580886173
We are about to discuss the subject of reforming the Commission and you will recall, Madam President, that at the beginning of the last session, I raised with you the question of whether, in the interests of openness and transparency, the Members' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the Internet.	1.475435382377172
You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening.	0.9328099499613088
I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and, if so, whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so.	1.4236786746404433
I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve.	1.3884536715964788
But we shall have a decision very soon.	1.0544988860176807
(The Minutes were adopted)	0.781558256585443
Reforming the Commission	-0.0
The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission.	0.9412483165321941
I shall give the floor straight away to the President, Mr Romano Prodi.	1.4771685279036386
- (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission.	1.2218729659635208
I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July: the outgoing Commission had been in crisis, I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination.	1.258418408462308
The climax of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the Commission, to reform it thoroughly, completely revolutionising the Commission' s way of working.	1.2128374673455828
Today, that commitment has been fully discharged: you have the reform here, before you, in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission.	1.4407849408882507
I would like to emphasise that, on that occasion too, the Commission voted unanimously, with one voice.	1.7093528725669034
Briefly, these are the main points of the reform.	1.470439809979637
One: definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources.	0.8281278675283252
This is at the heart of the system, and it is this, the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources, which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board.	1.3833862309813563
In order to do this, we have created a completely new policy-planning mechanism, a system which will allow the College to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these, to assign well-defined objectives to the Directorates-General and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control, which is of fundamental importance.	1.4249337609660422
In this context, activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives, actions and resources.	1.0425209903574228
The second point is human resources.	0.8548515203206859
It is the central part of our reform. Our staff are the Commission' s best asset, its richest resource.	1.4363302086192247
They are extremely highly qualified, of a calibre which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used.	1.3864507634180108
This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission, and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work.	1.1509717850671741
However, at the same time, I have found that morale amongst the Commission' s staff is very low.	1.373643914410826
Previously, there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution, but now staff are frequently demoralised by the unceasing criticism.	1.2099545066174424
All this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform.	1.2591703547291153
Recruitment, career development, mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria: there will be greater emphasis on individual service, credible and, above all, verifiable performance appraisal systems, lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility.	1.0251603690712645
These are the areas in which changes will be made.	1.0109099265998391
The third point, which was also rather a sensitive, key issue in the recent crisis, is financial management.	1.4718240854564946
This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security.	1.2636776152709457
We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General.	1.086775224243229
At the moment, our control system is completely centralised; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system.	1.2092431726506236
This means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice, decentralisation in every Directorate-General of the entire chain, that is of programmes, undertakings, contracts, expenditure and the related ex ante control systems, and an external auditing service which will direct these operations.	1.3490006656057634
This is a complete revolution of the Commission' s way of working; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking.	1.4080404882941842
We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage, and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place.	1.2931022730757296
In fact, the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world.	1.455843551889259
We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology.	1.020774209392826
We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration.	1.4136319842162208
The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper, and so we are going to become a paperless Commission.	1.3018525979396083
This will make the Commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the Commission.	1.2611986583277883
This is not just a technical revolution, but a complete organisational revolution as well.	1.3831030636603943
I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform, but I would first like to thank him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise.	1.121858227205579
We would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the Commission staff, who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission.	1.359430390350882
I would stress that this style of debate is something very new and, in my opinion, it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well.	1.2229391762157389
The White Paper before us is also the product of contributions from the Commission staff: they knew that the Commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become, once again, that internationally-admired institution which was at the heart of European history.	1.3790916381638743
The adoption of the White Paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and I hope that it will remain closed forever.	1.3317476580074106
Now we can focus on the future, on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005, the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks.	1.4805308078895594
The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan.	1.0499606371139434
We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission, a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions.	1.5462863441896537
This is why we are redefining all our work priorities.	1.0577368212226779
This is why we are offloading all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	1.2933550481813074
For this reason, we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently.	1.1956576816783349
We will make the best use of the resources at the Commission' s disposal, but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them.	1.4985835806344716
We may need to come back to you and ask for additional resources to fund the new tasks which have been assigned to us and those which will be assigned to us in the future.	1.1673046647178738
In September, we undertook to present a White Paper on reform, and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence.	1.3531405955859512
The Commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone - on what we achieve.	1.2337665028637994
I would, however, remind you, and this is my final point, that the Commission is not the only Community institution.	1.6548688991410216
Parliament and the Council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms.	1.2846697658290258
The Commission has resolutely forged a path, and I hope that all the institutions will follow it right to the very end, in the service of the citizens of Europe, to achieve an ever-stronger and ever more transparent Europe.	1.4827025257789643
I am glad to be here together with President Prodi and my colleague, Michele Schreyer, to present the White Paper adopted by the Commission this morning: "Reforming the Commission" .	1.3338321902410373
As honourable Members will see from the document, which will be available to them today, the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the Commission, with this Parliament and with the Council, which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January, have been very productive and resulted in useful refinements.	1.4278093983148568
Together with Romano Prodi, I express my gratitude to this House and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses.	1.4304490456199843
The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context.	0.8313386675160895
In the Commission, systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred.	1.0156482835192537
The treaties have been revised, new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission, and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union, in our continent and in the world.	1.520334278408754
Those realities, together with the approach of further enlargements, all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission, so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development, of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness, maximum responsibility and maximum accountability.	1.2701931230236663
The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are, of course, basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised.	1.2759524283168688
Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too.	0.8999956626715878
The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind, and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere.	1.7397907306134295
But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance.	1.384646299787017
That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide.	1.4024176623836921
The House will be aware, of course, that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone.	1.2589229519330472
All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly.	1.1392599801860341
I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum.	1.3241459054822806
One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House.	1.538315633971823
Last month, as Romano Prodi has just said, we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September.	1.3742443842587948
Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years.	1.1278022248542707
Inevitably, that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended.	1.3825855264526474
It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union.	1.0286002524347642
It means allocating staff to areas of high-policy importance within departments and across the Commission.	0.8592673736077135
And when that assessment is complete, we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us.	1.1953952540958466
If they are proven not to be, we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority.	1.467351185625201
If that does not meet with a positive response, the difficult issue of which of our lower-priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed, not just by the Commission, but by this Parliament and by the Council too.	1.3819480299628983
I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities.	1.1849097777264266
On the contrary, as many in this House understand, I am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability.	1.4839940094201496
That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both.	0.8674742634891884
In each of the three pillars of reform, the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital.	1.2767485227222068
The new activity-based management system, that the President just mentioned, will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time.	1.4316545864450625
The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will, therefore, be vital.	1.1778364447503167
Attempts to micro-manage the Commission' s operations are clearly in no one' s interest.	1.0479936890338966
A resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will, therefore, be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity-based management.	1.0437427559696983
In human resources policy, the involvement of Parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the Commission is accountable.	1.4448282196785407
Again, that will be a very demanding challenge.	1.4566558012753958
And finally, in the crucial area of financial management where the Court of Auditors, the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change, the support of this House in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance.	1.3550390645638828
In the limited time available for this statement, it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals.	1.2208811824461263
I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years, and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon.	1.432482935650692
It is clear, of course, that in many ways the really hard work starts now, with the implementation of our proposals.	1.5266537325095908
I look forward to working with this Parliament, with the Council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the Union and for the advantage of all of its peoples.	1.549015565339618
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	0.9727683663971937
We shall now move on to Question Time.	0.9055197217122346
Madam President, the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials.	1.350196197673631
Recently, the immunity of a former Commissioner was lifted and proceedings are currently pending before a judge in Brussels on the basis that Brussels is the seat of the Community institutions.	1.138848452726178
Yet these institutions have other seats and, given that the Community' s actions affect the whole Community territory, there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials, Commissioners and so on.	1.307682294343882
Is the Commission aware that, in order to lift immunity, it would be necessary to adopt a new legal instrument to regulate the procedure for holding Commission officials accountable, including former and current Commissioners?	1.2998770348013768
There is effective legal precaution.	0.7232433128311104
In the particular case that the honourable Member has in mind, not only did the Commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former Commissioner, but the former Commissioner herself advised the Commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted.	1.3666965902841945
I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member, but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted, and every single one of those requests has been met, and met with alacrity.	1.4075032564451047
I think that the House can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded, but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every Member State in seeking to get information, or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the Commission.	1.2587675726319116
As the Parliament' s rapporteur on the staff elements of your report, Mr Kinnock, I very much welcome the fact that we are now starting the process, and if I may say to all colleagues here, we have a very important task to do, which will be absolutely central to the future of the Commission and its effectiveness.	1.5952309591408516
And I make the point, before I move to my questions, that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because, of course, the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions.	1.4344686351453422
That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process.	1.321566533379783
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock, if I may.	1.1696320419044532
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms.	0.8647358127809404
Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern.	1.4856996595432694
Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside.	1.2441532165737692
And if we are to move forward, I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side, early evidence of change of culture, empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later.	1.2156928932588709
And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations.	1.4650727585868661
Indeed, it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced.	1.341605691059508
I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that.	1.3964783321799523
The second point that I want to make concerns information technology.	1.2636845986986174
Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms.	1.3130662033021194
On the second part of Mr Harbour' s question, he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement.	1.4030959387678406
Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials, which is already very strong, will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training, the allocation of responsibility, the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing.	1.366579071635188
Cultures are products of structures and systems, and the structures and systems have become old.	1.171195598131927
By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before.	1.3845099287538563
I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour.	1.1765599931096598
I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices.	1.0617863403743946
I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002, but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect.	1.2502728392970008
I do not use those as an excuse.	1.281083925485963
We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms, these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously.	1.250802682384578
I would like everything to happen much more quickly.	1.3490686413517072
It is better to do it absolutely properly.	1.0800523399593698
Madam President, we admire Mr Kinnock' s vision and sense of realism. For he is holding up visions of a well-oiled and effective administration and is, at the same time, drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated.	1.13666778123784
Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities.	1.6271670885971214
We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first.	1.0968776562292086
I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities, because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise.	1.347858944706449
Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context.	1.4868202545367135
I would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace, it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board.	1.3615668406431083
We must resolutely switch from our present, rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace.	1.3823603992624918
Could Mr Kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the Council and Parliament to come up with for these priorities?	1.1293425769630692
I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House.	1.183200992761372
Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out.	0.8764987963999126
We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities, not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have.	1.1884733023743401
One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union.	1.4546422299508284
One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect.	1.2529222365696273
Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism.	1.085606435873081
Since I was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised, I may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our mechanistic view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the Union and its enlargement.	1.477731118863733
I hope that, in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament, not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way, but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union.	1.4886762464277006
I do believe that reform with all it implies, including the new mechanisms, will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind.	1.2640387812364604
I would like to take the opportunity firstly to congratulate the Commission on unanimously bringing forward this timely and substantial White Paper with the accompanying action plan and I think when the President of the Commission described his Vice-President as acting with intelligence, enthusiasm and energy that indeed that is a fair and valid description with regard to this procedure.	1.3613762867734869
Two questions if I may.	0.5820944958601671
We anticipate, if I understand correctly, a report in September on core activities.	1.426216084680126
Will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the Parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the Commission anticipates such a procedure?	1.2712505004844639
Secondly, on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures, do I understand correctly - and I have not had the opportunity to wade into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the Commission is indeed to empower the Directorates-General to liberate them from the ex ante visae system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system?	1.3718191187077085
If that is the case I can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own Group, I believe that if we have demanded in this House as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the Commission, its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers.	1.5073579662852161
Let the managers manage.	0.44184164245424873
I want to thank Mr Cox and indeed his group for the way in which several Members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always, as he indicated, worthwhile.	1.249754936265465
So far as the September communication is concerned, it is unprecedented.	1.5654703454751326
It will not be just one of the screenings that the Commission has periodically undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within Directorates-General and across the Commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands.	1.3695574592650546
It is conceivable therefore - I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision.	1.4437588906413121
That is a sensible forecast to make, it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain.	1.542399639661568
Can I thank Mr Cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control.	1.225575165723023
I would emphasise, too, that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to "responsibilise" - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means.	1.5735662140666948
In undertaking such a development in our organisation I am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations, both in the public sector and in the private sector, in the last decade or so.	1.255403169177642
I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks.	1.20481248377757
Financial control will be absolutely secured, both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes, and because we will introduce a completely professional, independent internal audit service.	1.3861756599267294
As I said earlier, our ambition is total security for money and value for money.	0.9726644746718635
We are also interested in value for the people who work for us.	1.233371430655941
The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that.	0.9917882153195756
I am also grateful, at the risk of being repetitive, to Mrs Theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which, if she will allow me to say so, she played midwife to many of the changes which we are now contemplating.	1.52143808013236
I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage.	1.1844897959121425
First of all, I am not sure if I got the interpretation properly, but I do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as Mrs Theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control.	1.3377166213225151
There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation.	1.1730872716643197
However, because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control, and audit under the present terms, it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role, no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it.	1.3040327167374561
So, the changes that we seek to make - as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way at all.	1.4580445846206924
Coherence, consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures.	1.0174692917849841
One is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system, another is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that those standards are set and supervised, and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service.	1.2262748781858948
	-0.0
I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very strong assurances.	1.3571257262276593
There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General.	1.2441225649765928
If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control, the ex ante system can be used.	1.2439670588437173
Naturally, there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage.	1.3219695103157854
Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system, it most certainly can be used.	1.2672218115963345
Lastly on transition, I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called "soft law" .	1.0176298786337508
We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call "hard law" .	1.078165367608121
But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council.	1.412999001289213
There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper.	0.9144500004804698
In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances.	1.5109002964228708
The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition.	1.2843858969917268
Two other points I must make, because this is an essential question central to reform.	1.5490756914649724
The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia.	1.5548518717474318
Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline.	1.055304250289951
I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials, the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system.	1.2081279017567301
Inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring.	1.2070787614297303
Lastly, the system we currently have - as the Committee of Independent Experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable.	1.6400795079544153
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction.	1.0111622523275512
Change will have to come in any case, change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another.	1.1955407272369283
In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have, I am certain that we have installed, or that we will install on the basis of our proposals, a system that will provide the Union, its taxpayers and this House with complete security.	1.6489456785542862
Madam President, great importance has been attached to the reform process, which deserves to be acknowledged, although this may be somewhat premature.	1.4493641400900723
My question is this: there is a need for reform, due not least to the accession of new countries, and thus to the enlargement of the Union.	1.3615039287398434
How can we - the Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively, taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries?	1.2985189348596669
The delegations are actively engaged - as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic - but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another.	1.2495530161521005
How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission, and the work they perform together, more effective?	1.6814042814980488
I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that, apart from its own inherent merits, reform will be made necessary by accession, the enlargements, and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in.	1.198213084086784
It is essential that we have that reform, both for the sake of the current Union, and certainly to facilitate accessions.	1.5474978911095223
In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started, together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously, of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States.	1.3187419730328405
We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering.	1.2626068317327381
I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities, the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market, it will be difficult to see the joins.	1.469854189633301
That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see.	1.1401167802503778
All I can do now is to promise to strive for it.	0.9299638374086128
Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David' s Day.	0.9405200012227785
Thank you for the presentation.	1.049935623142678
It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public.	1.3525728328489734
That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time.	1.1588643327837211
It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome, but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork. Excessive paperwork.	1.4014855703951714
Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control?	0.9080351833082714
That is a clear complaint that we get.	1.380325394111493
That needs to be addressed.	0.3945565148784815
The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee.	1.2554999117927295
This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure.	1.457423057885163
Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee' s work?	0.9724731314943116
Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words.	1.5704514550217188
The mission of reconnecting with the European public is critical as Mrs Morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words.	1.3324212373277573
I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words, but we will try to lead by example.	1.4054811617974916
As far as excessive paper is concerned, the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan.	1.1612098675462912
We detest the excess of paper, but given the requirements that we have to check and re-check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control, sometimes the requirements of administration, which some call bureaucracy, are unavoidable.	1.344611844737305
In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too.	1.3909261693299833
We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent.	1.3389233815542771
One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform, the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe.	1.429539216912972
I know I can rely on everyone here.	0.6486175375635245
That concludes Question Time.	0.17283601513432983
I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock.	1.316779297734987
Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy	0.3949262442784289
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy.	0.5821450820660803
Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay.	0.9337426751498039
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again, here in the European Parliament.	1.14218364131751
Much has happened since the last time I was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent.	1.1324124934039916
Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened.	0.9081018140634548
This afternoon I should like to share with you some ideas, particularly on the Common Foreign and Security Policy.	1.0927086114453992
The world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred. However, I will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me.	1.210239946049937
In recent months, since the last time I appeared before you, important events have occurred in this House and also in the European Union. I would remind you of two of these events, one of which is very dear to you all as members of this Parliament, and particularly to the President.	1.5653208374686631
These are the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the European Union.	1.0279171154486788
The events in Kosovo and the Balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds. There are also important issues at stake in the Middle East in which the President of this House played a major role on her recent trip.	1.360105749126266
Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America.	1.3439316677512734
Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region.	1.545445761880142
However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki.	1.2693294394801342
I will speak of this briefly. If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them.	1.343199809955418
The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago.	0.9943108588712823
Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent.	1.1535316287311361
These were essentially of three types which I will describe.	0.9663967590910034
The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management.	1.1398901513668942
The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union' s relations with third countries and other organisations.	1.4144950536099634
This basically involves relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and relations between the European Union and those countries which, although geographically in Europe, are not part of the European Union, or at least not at the moment.	1.4005888049159976
I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events.	1.1045856700853938
Firstly, with regard to the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning, 1 March 2000. This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council.	1.4244018836319186
Therefore, two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision, a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union.	1.3999457131189714
I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch.	1.0250104327595384
You can be satisfied with the progress made.	0.8743002203795622
The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months.	1.180870169104187
Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration.	1.3340538547337069
This Military Committee, as you can imagine, will have various duties.	1.4077953377944132
In the interim stage, its basic duty will be to advise the Council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will, of course, try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next.	1.4232793694504642
Thirdly, the Military Staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries. Together with myself, this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare, with the assistance of the Military Committee, any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the European Union.	1.3792413962880241
This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces.	1.0655769326580666
Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics, not for military purposes, but with strictly humanitarian ends.	1.318614222333901
We are therefore working diligently in this respect. Madam President, if, a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time, I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today, that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use, many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad.	1.5510941805211444
We are not mad. What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent.	1.4896239612278763
Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination, drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki.	1.2487545308919399
In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission.	1.0204044953888602
I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time.	1.1639978995247275
I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you. We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility.	1.5467240513775309
Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace.	1.4956265945597318
It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict, to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them. As you may recall, it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States.	1.38759161805556
It will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days, or two months, to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year. This is a major operation and an important objective but I can say that we are in a position to meet this challenge which the Heads of State and Government posed in Helsinki.	1.4044586272289845
On Monday, just two days ago, in Sintra, a beautiful city very close to Lisbon, the Defence Ministers of the fifteen Member States met and took some important decisions towards implementing this Headline Goal defined in Helsinki.	1.2594572254734882
The proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us, including this House.	1.1013018767265157
I will set this out in five points.	0.8525194652958952
Firstly, before the next General Affairs Council which will take place this month, we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the Headline Goal, bearing in mind the views that the military planners may consider appropriate.	1.3836291839406092
To say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace.	1.3881582049988228
We must therefore have considered all possible scenarios so that we can do this job and do it well.	1.0908624682748738
Before 24 March we will therefore have established this timetable so that the General Affairs Council can, on this date, do its job and do it well.	1.285195026769565
Secondly, we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries.	1.1917539092935048
Thirdly, we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide.	1.164930014657282
We may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs.	1.341045124326646
How can we do this?	1.0898032591565414
This should be decided by a Conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen Member States.	1.358596948659536
Madam President, the timetable must ensure that, by December of this year during the French presidency, the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match. We will then be able to say truthfully that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available.	1.6038077180066208
This is what we are doing and we are committed to this.	1.2079234088162154
We have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the Portuguese presidency, which is clearly carrying out excellent work, and during the French presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions.	1.3104083140008553
I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils, those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency.	1.4032932601361454
On these four occasions, the Heads of Government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that, by the year 2003, we are able to deploy what we have agreed, if necessary.	1.5419987202743857
Madam President, we are therefore working on this issue with determination, energy and the full support of all the governments and all the Heads of Government.	1.450424461560898
I have two further points to make on this process.	1.108166969052531
The European Union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which I have referred which, although geographically in Europe, are not members of the European Union.	1.407593921936412
We have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises, which I hope will not be the case, all forces and all countries will be more than welcome.	1.5204917687629496
Secondly, we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with NATO. The operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types.	1.4449095033874868
The first type will be operations in which European forces are involved within the framework of NATO. The second will be operations involving European forces and directed by them, but using the means and infrastructure of NATO.	1.3124880399805114
The third will be operations in which the European forces act alone. In the first and second types we will need to cooperate with NATO and must therefore establish a transparent, positive and confident relationship between ourselves and NATO, as appropriate, which will be good for both the Alliance and ourselves.	1.4065605111116006
Madam President, I have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide, the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months.	1.5735788576505614
However, we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well.	1.1851621130877201
As far as possible, we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans.	1.220719112553184
We are working in this direction with the Commission and Commissioner Patten.	1.634942393767556
On Saturday morning I will meet with all the Ministers for Home Affairs of the fifteen Member States to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well.	1.122747709724579
There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that, after a few months, a police force is needed rather than a military force. Then, in the final moments of the crisis, it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police.	1.3592352067543843
In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission.	1.3471779243927613
I am not going to say much more on these issues.	1.032194960040988
Many other events have taken place in recent weeks which I should like to mention, such as in Kosovo, the Middle East and Chechnya. There are also many other issues which I should like to discuss with you.	1.4055172957509074
However, I would prefer, Madam President, to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that I have time to answer them.	1.5538232989499208
However, before this happens, I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya.	1.5005298941136134
Mr Gil-Robles returned this morning from Chechnya where he visited Grozny. When we spoke he gave me his initial impressions which are not good, as you can imagine.	1.2375733303373995
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating.	0.8618261541588741
In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations.	1.1416736050427851
In Grozny, there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat.	1.149698699684738
Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you.	1.1440928654933098
Mr Gil-Robles told me that, when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night, the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities. The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well, if feasible.	1.3840198589067338
These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment.	1.3369385326962866
I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities.	1.4497798476119743
Madam President, this brings me to the end of my speech.	1.4565841050161532
I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning.	0.97205536440584
I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission. This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations.	1.457139304890166
Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world.	1.26683522395739
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana. I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.	1.207543738118112
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	0.9021209512086343
Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes.	1.394394406860655
Commissioner, would you like to speak now or a little later?	1.4407462541916232
(The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later) Very well, thank you.	0.9817196837811544
Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Javier Solana, usted no es una persona loca, todo lo contrario (you are not mad, quite the opposite).	1.1856187792102657
We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit.	1.1272395599294693
We know that you have an important role in this.	1.209768274105237
I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today, and in this context, and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question.	1.6285368495788857
We cannot, of course, talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya.	1.0053834920984606
My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group.	0.929818519827195
I want to concentrate on Kosovo.	0.8521212936652692
It is now quite clear that the situation in Kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means.	1.253395447041784
The KFOR forces have made, and are making, an invaluable contribution, but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term.	1.302335966300331
It has now reached the point where the Pentagon has prohibited American forces from returning to northern Mitrovica.	0.8948621994008059
They have now been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish and Swedish troops.	0.8215766025889828
It is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred, but it is important for the sake of Kosovo, the Balkans and Europe that we do not fail.	1.3893874642105692
Through the Stability Pact, we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation.	1.2194218083040493
This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union' s common foreign and security policy.	1.0466804363676088
At the moment, there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in Kosovo.	1.0762612731989074
Last autumn, we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force.	1.20556888805061
I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing.	1.3286122937875853
I hope that this discussion will, in the first place, concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied.	1.2408982313196228
When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament' s and, as I understand it, also the Commission' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo.	1.5263854987309884
The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management, an idea which has already been translated into practical action.	1.444798533979541
Another, at least as important, lesson of our experience, however, is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently.	1.3442919550013364
Therefore, the EU must also have an independent, credible conflict-prevention capacity.	1.3572816610279148
On behalf of the Commission, Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction.	1.3183320524152962
I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations, together with a Commission Crisis Centre.	1.2040465215457266
My last question to Mr Solana is this: what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind?	1.3262331620463956
How have these been organised by Mr Solana' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission?	1.1523504708361296
Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders.	1.1693643073587907
I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian, peace-keeping and peace-making tasks.	1.2053120070152155
But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe.	1.3053836043962486
Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights.	0.7358818247584957
I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament.	1.1031642347588
You must lay these concerns to rest for, as you yourself have said, when we are able to present a united transatlantic front, we are in a position to do something.	1.4575960265061936
When we are divided, we are weakened, and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged.	1.5134025646139702
So, maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway, Turkey and Canada, either.	1.200624030687518
You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers.	1.022754109537442
As George Robertson has said so often, we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo.	1.1703282613047723
It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war.	0.9502230260854463
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats.	0.9669160429307678
Everything else is wishful thinking.	0.5053846526137632
That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment. We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra.	1.3271694446500009
The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny.	1.078493056161894
This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States.	0.9805759691887822
No soldier can, of course, be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament.	1.1819304673226478
It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army.	1.3277435882985524
It will be a force comprised of various national units.	1.1202137702150983
What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment.	1.1342053863918649
However, there is, of course, also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament.	1.417793304366746
As someone who both speaks and listens, we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.	0.9905970700492158
Finally, I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion.	1.1217831070799822
Yesterday, a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister.	1.314642785846354
He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much.	1.1605979832356832
Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table.	1.0733403001530173
We share your delight, as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired.	1.046177405780127
There is one thing I shall again finally emphasise: that the purpose of all this is, of course, that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all.	1.2304017316159972
That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries.	1.3044828182730601
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are all behaving like children.	1.351599033692605
You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers.	1.037642875981632
It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004, 2005, 2006.	0.8559192037215474
But what about Kosovo in the year 2000?	0.8983231870595456
You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles. I have received an e-mail from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pristina at the moment.	1.3266822134210423
He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina.	0.8664333530506225
He treated Roma, Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo.	1.0704736209514178
A man with three children and he was murdered.	0.7492379993358029
We need policemen in Kosovo right now!	0.6446944173159741
We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice.	0.9248954148213303
I am not a warmonger, but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in Kosovo, then what is the point in having soldiers at all?	1.51718141823456
People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo, but that is the price of freedom at the moment.	1.403799046715631
If we allow what is happening today in Kosovo to continue - border provocation, Serbian provocation, Albanian provocation, etc. we are heading for war.	1.2695685198922244
Tell me, what civilian forces are being mobilised, Mr Patten?	1.4345704035567137
We need a civilian task force in Kosovo now to monitor what is happening, and to tell the military and the police what they must do, otherwise everything we did in Bosnia and everything we did in Kosovo will be negated by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence.	1.3500511586701787
(Interruption from the extreme right by Mr Martinez) We have a major problem, because we are providing travel warrants for the people, but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis, as in Chechnya.	1.5508884496448643
Mr Poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so.	1.33606064615624
He is not always right, but in this case he is.	1.7564183274660918
I am in favour of a hardline policy against Austria, but we shall then have a responsibility towards Russia.	1.3430749007721585
I do not like foreign ministers who say nothing - whether they are German and from my party, whether they are French from the broad left or whether they are Italians from any party!	1.1664491710996763
In the current situation, we should say to the Russians "If you want money, if you want us to reduce your debts, you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into Russia" .	1.4577565081263584
If not, we are not prepared to pay for their war, since, by reducing the debt, by giving them money, we are paying their soldiers to carry out the massacres.	1.4469239531094804
We are accomplices in the massacres in Chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers.	0.9877019649627586
It is not enough just to say, "You, the murderers, please stop the slaughter!"	1.400044367945791
They know full well that they should not commit these acts.	1.016832666935744
Do you think that Mr Putin does not know that what he is doing in Chechnya is not good?	1.2881824393482506
But that is his strategy, he instigated this war.	1.1718195615128855
From the beginning, he wanted this war in order to become president.	1.2563095286822161
So that is the world as it is today.	1.2806512338079314
For that reason I say to you: my Group is not entirely in agreement, but I am in favour of European defence.	1.4527222463127396
I believe that European defence should be scrutinised by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments.	1.37162671708011
First of all, the European Parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers.	1.268434385882208
If a civilian task force can, at the same time, intervene before and during a conflict and if we fail to take that step, we are behaving like children who like to play at sending in soldiers, but who are incapable of sending in civilians.	1.1399470248089445
As long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements, we shall not be credible.	1.2931244096956085
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are very uneasy about replying to you because, in our view, you are responsible for an area that does not really exist.	1.4523490658166147
We believe that poor old Europe can only speak with one voice to say nothing or, and this is possibly more serious, that it can only resolve its diplomatic contradictions by simply tagging along with American politics.	1.2292247349083592
In the lyrical mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of, at Sintra, the Fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is 'pretentiously' called autonomous.	1.1564794569247858
Now, the Union can certainly call the body an 'action force' even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the mustering - on paper - of men, weapons and logistics.	1.4898087128185946
But to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether.	1.0599635639048495
What interests will this so-called force defend, in view of the fact that the countries of Europe do not have the same interests?	1.3286795984021649
Let us just consider for a moment.	0.7049704163628778
What is the basis of armed action?	1.2854225665640253
It is the defence of a territory, the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital?	1.4118456575671632
Just what is an army in the absence of a home country, in the absence of territory - because Europe is incapable of clearly defining its borders - and in the absence of clearly identified vital interests, which the Fifteen have, for good reason, never dared to discuss.	1.4004115679835962
In short, what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy?	1.1218584616233622
We fall back on a kind of ersatz army based on humanitarian rights, a kind of army in the service of vague ideas, of an ideal, the dangers of which have many times been shown in history.	1.2620711113594327
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one' s own interests.	0.9603053865665195
But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system.	0.9851794538137554
Who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the twosome formed by London and Berlin, escorted by their respective henchmen, and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of Washington, seeing themselves at best as bit-part players.	1.1727968076107165
Mr Solana, you yourself are a perfect illustration of this, as it were, structural complicity, passing smoothly from NATO to the CFSP as if they were one and the same. Of course, in reality, they are the same thing.	1.272659258602988
It is still the old imperial service.	1.005223195032218
It is not without some amusement that we have seen you, in your pathetic rivalry with Mr Patten, present this delightful and most charming argument: one day you told a German newspaper, "I am the one that the Americans phone up" .	1.3801638044484539
You might have added, Mr Solana, 'to give me their instructions' , because that is what we see, in fact.	1.458451476482808
In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it.	1.2790847781744596
Yes, Jean-Claude Martinez was indeed right to interrupt you, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. In every case, it is follow-my-leader syndrome.	1.2391081055497712
Do you think I am going over the top?	1.3140452891258962
Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience.	0.7843865020953846
Echelon is one of many examples of this, giving an image of Europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here.	1.355354856018826
The experts speak of a cultural problem, I think they might be right!	1.4257196480434713
On behalf of the combined European right, I must say to you, Mr Solana, as High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, we do not have confidence in you.	1.3851281811518847
You say that you are against war, but as Secretary-General of NATO you started a war.	1.1210845360541426
A war of aggression, slavishly carrying out American military policy, in a sphere that was not that of the North Atlantic Treaty, against a state that had never been a member, that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non-interference as well as those governing the declaration of war.	1.3493702306946733
Today, even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for.	1.427069796833023
We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern, that is the least one can say.	1.4217528249985405
First of all, in your view, does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world?	1.5198816566970295
Secondly, if you do recognise this right, then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on?	1.499061050743777
I can already hear your reply: humanitarian standards.	0.8029064970274598
In Kosovo, it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia.	1.1725307173448634
When the US killed 2 000 people in Panama, it was not to impose their politics, it was to combat drug trafficking.	1.3641794975858275
When they landed in Somalia, before having to withdraw in disarray, it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route, it was to restore hope.	1.3722985670971768
'Restore hope' , do you remember?	1.1196958546292561
In a nutshell, can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons.	1.043040122934441
Finally, you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management.	1.3081868099620695
Not to make war, of course, but to protect peace.	1.4625352971298529
But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions.	0.9930046956328433
Can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any State you care to mention, particularly those which, in their elections, do not ratify the policy adopted by the other Member States of the Union?	1.3279508418238388
Mr Solana, these questions convey our concern.	1.1938517226925718
You say that you are against war, but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that.	1.2995858094988835
May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward.	1.0690363200679278
Mr President, it goes without saying that the development of a European security and defence identity will have a huge impact on the three countries which joined NATO last year: Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.	1.2310531547983592
As candidate countries of the European Union, they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning, that is to say as of now.	1.3698348486272653
This request, however, was not honoured by the Council at its Helsinki Summit at the end of last year. In the Finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation.	1.4127306148991228
This is why I would like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, to what extent Prague, Warsaw and Budapest are, or will be, involved in European military crisis management plans.	1.2850402672114147
Given Poland' s rather critical stance, this question is all the more pressing.	1.1791736316596861
Its reservation is captured in the following, rather blunt wording: avoid American isolationism and European separatism.	0.9965953624954549
As one might expect, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Bronislaw Geremek, has expressed this concern in more diplomatic terms: "The development of a European defence identity should not be at the expense of NATO' s unity.	1.3992390450318604
If anything, the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO" .	1.157431804281229
We all very much share this opinion.	0.7558250372017574
Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today.	1.0702974196856356
The Czech Defence Minister, for example, shares this opinion. In the autumn of last year, the latter stated: "Security within Europe is not divisible.	1.3752433106560444
It cannot be restricted to a small number of countries, with others only being allowed to observe or execute decisions" .	1.104008584280386
These opinions add substance to my question addressed to Mr Solana.	1.0057945587820785
Poles only need five words for this: nothing about us without us!	0.8802346915627081
What do the current EU Member States intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries?	0.9358756830643626
Mr President, I too welcome the presence of the High Representative and his availability to answer Members' questions this time round. On his first appearance in November this was not possible, although this was not Mr Solana' s fault.	1.4075196938162151
It should be acknowledged, however, that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members.	1.3089577155578098
We should also acknowledge the efforts which Mr Solana is making towards achieving a more effective, visible and coherent Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union.	1.2323136611553533
In this respect, I agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian, diplomatic, humanitarian and police elements, to which Mr Solana referred.	1.3127143129171162
The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies.	1.0692601918847833
In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy.	0.9198207033028812
One of these milestones was the meeting in Sintra which I would like to ask Mr Solana about.	1.3317777065576963
This meeting was based on two documents, one being a British document on the Headline Goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union.	1.0882908080789881
Mr Solana, would you be prepared, at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit? I should like to ask Mr Patten and, through you, the President-in-Office to also attend and answer the same question.	1.3179914794575585
Secondly, to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7% of GDP to defence expenditure?	1.3019139381086255
I would like to hear your opinion. Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect?	1.4169727520919557
Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the 'Crisex 2000' exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation?	1.371922435729759
Fourthly and finally, if the Member States asked for this, would you be prepared to chair the Political and Security Committee? In this way you could contribute all your experience as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary-General of the Western European Union and a former Secretary-General of NATO.	1.237584309168505
Mr Solana, as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall limit my speech to those subjects.	1.1082822359784061
You have, Mr Solana, heard the force of the criticisms made by the Members of Parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in Kosovo, Chechnya and elsewhere.	1.1961578514931681
For my part, I do not wish to give up hope.	1.1651492715741918
And today, as far as you are concerned, I acknowledge your efforts to build a European security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed.	1.3699101323811376
Indeed, we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective, in any case, the objective that I wish to achieve.	1.5083218618457201
But I do give you credit for your intense work, the number of meetings held, your efforts to create a rapid intervention force, your specific efforts to prevent crises, to manage them or stop them through civilian means and, if necessary, by military means.	1.309034713498093
I should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the "what is to be done" variety.	1.3567550282969265
The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December, without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon.	1.0557477765961907
What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings?	1.2681066992336651
And finally, what do you most need at these next summits?	1.4744719582051313
My second question is different, although it is not unconnected with the previous one.	1.3143303590818498
It concerns the next IGC.	0.9122506839239323
Do you not think that the agenda of the IGC should include the question of European security and defence policy in order to supplement the treaties, if it appeared that, as the texts of the treaties stand at the moment, they do not allow for a real defence policy to be established?	1.5329893745980678
I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February.	1.406977094244803
Can you tell us your position on this subject?	1.0023062137955319
Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe.	1.137304396153739
At long last, the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative.	1.2731661633632263
The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent.	1.008828317017351
However, if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times, the Treaty must include a flexibility clause.	1.5090688122501772
Mr Solana can play an important role in this.	0.8032438632071603
He is not stupid. Certainly not!	0.9267330858191956
He is a driven man, a competent man.	1.0982030593467458
But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence.	0.974512666779805
In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit.	1.361018240002903
One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep, Mr President.	0.9809287656672891
From a democratic point of view, I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable. This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is, of course, not a democratically elected politician, but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament.	1.472477264912625
His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten, as has been illustrated again today, in fact.	1.2724005905576123
It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold.	1.4185369484017663
This too is unacceptable in my view.	0.955854354966023
Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power.	1.3669632132512382
Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself.	0.6420379631842893
Mr President, peace is the European Union' s very raison d' être. I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly.	1.4103973049600664
We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance.	1.2337244375031653
But look at us now! We are observing the misery in Chechnya in a position of powerlessness, and regard the wars in Africa with indifference, despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries, given that they are ex-colonies.	1.3546488009216333
Some of them are our ACP partners.	0.8566275407293237
The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment.	0.914156579368965
In Kosovo, we stepped in with military means, having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia.	1.2878825565636571
We are now unable to guide the peace.	0.99238022995736
This is why Europe is not credible as a Union.	1.3143221992880731
I do not believe, Mr Solana, that we can restore this credibility by military means.	1.3981839083329528
As representatives from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries, but we always needed to fight those who came to oppress us.	1.1334548893875147
We are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term. This is not because we are against European defence, but European defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound, democratically-based decision process in respect of foreign affairs.	1.2920678316157308
At the moment, Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of.	1.4472278843937125
I can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level.	1.1686238281399273
In my opinion, it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment, which are such nice toys, after all.	1.3452332020223317
I am very sceptical about the fact that Commissioner Patten cannot inform us in an equally credible way that he has drafted a prevention plan to stave off further degeneration, underdevelopment and conflicts in Europe and outside.	1.1300075650910109
Because our borders do not stop at the Mediterranean Sea.	0.777030056209764
Mr President, allow me to start with the conquest of Kosovo.	1.002392944219056
It is obvious since the NATO bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing, not to promote peace and order but to drive a wedge even further into Yugoslavia, to change the borders and to promote the New Order.	1.2864265000531483
Today, we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities.	1.111201159877176
All the signs point towards a second round of attacks on Yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the KLA attacks on Serbs in Mitrovica, the attempt to annex three towns in southern Serbia to Kosovo, the promotion of the independence of Kosovo, the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into Kosovo via Greece, despite the objections of the Greek people and, at the same time, intense efforts by NATO and the European Union to overturn the legitimate government of Yugoslavia.	1.1983923538047239
On the other hand, despite his declarations on humanity and peace, it is clear from what Mr Solana has told us that, according to the Helsinki resolutions, we intend to set up a terrorist army, starting with 60 000 men, in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the parapet.	1.2748228874457603
Mr Solana has confirmed our view that, in a militarised European Union, NATO will have the upper hand.	1.4657891132517795
That is why this job went to Mr Solana, the Secretary-General of NATO, who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia; the right man for the right job, against whom charges have been filed, calling for him to be tried as a war criminal.	1.2872620254846658
Commissioner, Mr Solana, there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas.	1.357859271337616
I wonder, and here I do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow Members, about the direction in which we are going.	1.4361947294469222
I think that contrary to the great process of Economic and Monetary Union, which was an integrated process within the Community structures, today, unfortunately, the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure.	1.4043024284503114
My first question, Mr Solana and Commissioner, is to establish whether, together, you have framed strategies that will, at least gradually, lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the Community process.	1.5293364925278934
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union.	1.037003218823992
We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear.	1.442630675467525
I also believe that we should not underestimate, and this is a question that I put to you, the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries.	1.4861448040234284
We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community.	1.0755306401911156
Today, they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy, and I believe that they are working with that in mind.	1.4085997368487142
Finally, with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo.	1.3504794314409427
Without this status, there will only be instability, murders, provocation by Belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the European Union should come to a decision on this matter.	1.3791959826076143
Finally, I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives, as we say in common parlance, are getting a bit much.	1.5382829749841753
I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice, for example.	1.1851378085687083
Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates, we have still not had a trial, and we still do not know what is happening.	1.2422601542589393
As far as tourism is concerned, there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium, for example.	1.2001948381146963
So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him, which is what I hope will happen.	1.3446263926210364
Mr President, first of all, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Solana on this first day of March, for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on European security and defence policy.	1.2398079603058705
But I do wonder what his own view is on this.	1.2279882257761134
According to the documents, cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful.	1.1589439138404771
You said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch. You have to admit, it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks.	1.3470160264018562
But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light?	1.1624768884980352
I - and I believe many with me in Parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent.	1.2695275256177858
Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO.	1.3024711013063257
One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course.	1.1220480662876349
The Treaties also point in that direction, although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar.	1.2426037721304142
We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar.	0.9708025844585223
Actually, I hear less and less about this.	1.268314399644366
I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment.	1.3588225462723849
It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation, which would work very well.	1.3522103102288758
But is there not more to it than that?	0.8848455474658907
I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence.	1.0446830768598852
The European pillar does not really function any more as such. Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks.	1.085293107487147
Is this actually how we want things done?	0.7290053384301023
Moreover, whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union, there is no longer any mention of Article V, which is, of course, of direct concern to us. Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg.	1.498811349284539
Will it be omitted?	0.688255604283879
At the same time, an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets.	1.1834876140982233
I think that this is to be welcomed, but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider, collective defence tasks.	1.34615464503151
I wonder how this will develop.	0.692399898928325
I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future.	1.1485421326128002
Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling?	1.023010373577254
I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy.	1.230357282545043
I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy?	1.3421879657535114
The fabric of Turkey' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities.	0.9224291848110262
That would seem odd to me.	0.5847877657167179
Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door.	1.1596170091604416
Will they also take part in our defence policy?	0.8903754286044337
It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least.	1.6005985435737509
High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force.	1.2325750984345878
However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further.	1.2052491554343856
I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.329453758806192
A word of warning to the latter: this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation.	1.156891874017595
We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management.	1.255866108768907
At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing.	1.4314237688680942
Do you think that any of these issues could be included, at least in the agenda of the current Conference?	1.3739642749302805
Mr Solana, I am sitting quite close to you, close enough to see your face.	1.3391851448835268
I think that you have aged, your face is quite lined.	1.3645335442995414
It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers, as Mrs Maes just put it, and what you do not say.	1.337063297654609
You bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another bout of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and yet you have stood up here, while blood is being spilled in Kosovo, and you have not said a word about it.	1.2595105118003809
You are Spanish; you are from a large country, Mr Solana.	1.2939623277987564
Spain and Franco were not one and the same.	0.754964627369344
Spain maintained its unity, it kept the Basque country and Andalucia and Catalonia and it did well to do so, because no one identified Spain with Franco and no one played around with Spain' s unity in the name of a Fascist dictator.	1.2200465760512007
Today, you are identifying Yugoslavia with Milosevic and you are playing with Voivodina, with Montenegro and with southern Serbia. It is you who has created this mess.	1.3252542513149086
Which is why, unless they are accompanied by clear political solutions which respect borders and autonomy and all the democratic guarantees, all these plans on paper will lead to new blood-letting in the Balkans.	1.134920189724682
Mr Solana, the war in Kosovo and the continuing crisis, have served to reveal a European public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the European Union, throughout the world, should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America and that the time has come to share the burden, which our American friends have constantly been demanding since Europe became a world economic power.	1.3300733734885668
Over the last year, the Member States of the Union have, naturally, decided to implement specific measures designed to strengthen the operational capability of their armed forces and the informal summit in Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main trends.	1.2514227912200715
I have two questions on this subject to which your knowledge of the subjects concerned and the parties involved should make it possible to provide enlightening replies for our further debates and our work.	1.1657867446865513
The first question concerns the training of this rapid intervention force of 60 000 men, which, as you have said, is likely to be deployed to perform peace-keeping and peace-building missions and be capable of maintaining them on a long-term basis, if necessary.	1.1365175181059939
For the information of our colleagues, I must say here that the corresponding contingents should be divided into three parts: one third to prepare the mission, one third to carry it out and one third for rehabilitation, following often difficult ordeals for personnel and equipment.	1.2413687154448536
This explains why the initial figures given in the press, setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men, is close to reality, which has certainly surprised the uninitiated.	1.1849620769620504
My first question, Mr Solana, will be simple and more direct, perhaps, than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me.	1.204715585150468
You know the French proverb, 'Nothing for nothing' .	1.0696499018798904
Do you really think that the governments of the Union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them, apparently at least, have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends.	1.2946361286045407
My second question is of a more technical nature, but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible.	1.3681688967952332
You have told us, in this regard, that three committees are being set up, a political committee and a security committee, which started up today, and a military committee.	1.5987403773478819
You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union.	1.2356394237076969
In the operation of the temporary institutions, whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr Solana, what status you intend to confer on the members of the Alliance and on the associate States of the WEU which, I repeat, are not yet members of the European Union?	1.4689450821012837
Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, in the different political and security committees or in the military committee?	1.634428667973895
You know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and I should like to say that I understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion.	1.344903502131886
Mr President, Secretary-General, as you can tell, the Members of this House have listened with great interest to your information on the result of the Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers in Sintra and its significance in the European integration process in terms of security and defence.	1.5113644809999345
Thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with Mr Gil-Robles.	0.7614469568451828
However, in terms of foreign policy, I am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements, as some Members have said this afternoon, without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against.	1.4025942044378152
I will give you an example.	0.7541905984383183
During the recent trip by the President of the European Parliament to the Middle East, which you mentioned, the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the European Union in the on-going peace process in the region.	1.353685502930492
Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties?	1.122505572432336
This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt.	1.2801057711185801
In this respect, as you will know, the European Parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the Community. This is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination.	1.41500640909842
Could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative, without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee?	1.273629384268786
Mr Solana, it has been said many times in this House that prevention is better than cure.	1.3977752040176987
Of course it is, but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful.	1.175551932353777
In any case, it is prevention that I would like to discuss today.	1.376027666458974
War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf.	0.8281722745468474
As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.	1.244320022695505
If this happens, the United States' Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention.	1.36177378009187
A visit to Iraq and meetings with the Iraqi leaders and leading figures, particularly Mr Tarek Aziz, convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the Iraqi Government to cooperate in enforcing Resolution 1284.	1.1373859155675627
However, the responsible authorities of the Western countries need to make it clear that, once the mission of the United Nations committee has been successfully completed, the embargo will be lifted and normal trade relations will be able to be resumed.	1.3959171674974564
I would like to know what you and Europe are doing, Mr Solana, or what you intend to do in the near future, to stave off this threat of war.	1.4427030707670638
Today, we have the chance to prevent it; tomorrow it may be too late.	1.1549821087829686
I would also like to know whether, in this context, it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis, or to set them free if this is within their power.	1.3529377097481279
As we sit here, hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in Mozambique.	0.8158861944999488
This has not just happened.	0.7972329733995451
The flooding has been going for weeks, and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need.	1.3274200691507836
The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic.	1.2261365324972902
For a long time, many of us have sounded a warning that the European Union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision-making structures, when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments, particularly for humanitarian intervention.	1.3600325530036785
I acknowledge Mr Patten' s efforts in this direction, but what a pity that the governments of the Member States had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of NATO.	1.1515734770115726
Of course, there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries.	1.2589690715033683
These are of long standing, but are being addressed already within NATO.	1.3488032482257322
I have not yet heard a convincing security-policy explanation of why the European Union needs to establish autonomous, decision-making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the NATO structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival NATO.	1.2609145979646719
After all, the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table.	1.153018558450164
NATO is largely European.	0.5133834998084759
Finally, Mr Solana, I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe.	1.286998166361435
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, with regard to the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the European Union in particular.	1.466259405190866
Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide.	1.2701264073520118
How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters?	1.1839908685471932
How should we describe the sinister filtration camps, which are comparable to concentration camps, in which the population is suffering the most dreadful humiliation and from which able-bodied men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive?	1.1079800650032283
How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called "cleansing" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe?	1.4409681309356073
And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres?	1.0400791285490254
If that is realpolitik, if we really do not have any means, Mr Solana, as High Representative of the CFSP, and Commissioner, I put this question to you both, let us at least use the means that we do have, namely, the aid programmes to Russia.	1.5796523094230268
The war in Chechnya proves, if proof were necessary, that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers.	1.4226569275710708
Let us therefore ensure that in future any euro spent in the Russian Federation is spent to alleviate the suffering of the people who are the victims of war, to the exclusion of any other objective.	1.1517302626468735
Mr High Representative, you have spoken to us of the progress made to date in relation to the decisions taken at Helsinki.	1.2911291134393386
Some of us here are passionately in favour of creating a distinctly European security organisation to defend peace in the world.	1.0688929631463642
Of course we recognise the role of the Security Council, as the Helsinki resolutions clearly state, in maintaining international peace and security.	1.4902031499488513
However, we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the Security Council, as referred to at Helsinki, was contested recently.	1.459405653012412
The point is: does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism, which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg decisions?	1.2894816743613136
What about the infrastructures?	0.5140768088448848
Is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy?	1.1625866823406206
Secondly, what will happen to the European defence industry which, after all, comes under the more general activities relating to this system?	1.4571042653121824
Will current programmes continue to be implemented?	1.1072404582746547
Finally, if the Treaty needs to be amended, how do you think this amendment will be implemented, following the report to be submitted in Feira? How will it be incorporated into the more general procedure for amending the institutional framework of the Treaty and how do you think this will fit in with the possibility of a system of qualified majority voting?	1.3997520244555497
Has any thought been given to the matter?	0.9475449213944143
Has it been discussed?	0.4422446655932041
And to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient?	1.136900991909804
Mr President, I seem to recall from my study of European history, that the 1809 Convention of Sintra was a controversial peace agreement which probably lengthened rather than shortened the Napoleonic wars and nearly cost the Duke of Wellington his job.	1.0750034152193042
I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement.	1.3120646111854946
That said, I would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far.	1.263686761090411
But it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters, and the real test of the European defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity, rather than nicely formulated institutions.	1.363101816649896
And, to that end, I am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation, or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity, particularly given the American statements that they are not giving intelligence to Europeans until they can deal with security.	1.3847807429844765
We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels.	1.113219926812645
To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure, because some Member States spend considerably more than others.	1.1930729537486482
And indeed, some Member States are not geared for mobility.	1.3954299798888337
They are very static in their military forces, and unsuitable for this sort of warfare.	1.13203250672243
Can I perhaps also turn to Mr Patten as well and ask, in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing, to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long-term conflict-causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream EU policies, particularly in development, because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right.	1.3281923967282216
And finally, can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development.	1.4519292171957983
We cannot leave it simply to governments.	0.7024251712088058
I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra.	0.7606722975281908
They constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective European Security and Defence Policy.	0.9256488311887833
The creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving EU policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction.	1.1756764049855009
The recognition that the 60 000 strong military force will be involved in both peacemaking and peacekeeping is also appropriate.	0.8793548914255984
However, while all these developments are indeed welcome, I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions.	1.7200346339310328
I am anxious to know how effective the EU' s policy planning and early warning unit has been.	1.0282044110491546
While Commissioner Patten' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in Mozambique will be opportune, I would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information.	1.0735048900861979
Would the High Representative be prepared to say to what extent this unit, which has been strongly supported by the committee of which I and Mr Titley are members, assisted in providing early information, analysis and an indication of the policy planning options open to yourselves?	1.351806842807558
I would also like to support Mr Titley' s comments on an effective role for the Parliament in this whole area.	1.1798452296505064
If we are to realise our ambitions in the field of foreign policy, then effective anticipation and preparation for all sorts of crises, particularly humanitarian ones, are essential prerequisites.	1.346183645105785
When Mr Solana last spoke to this Parliament I was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention, but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way.	1.2494736388358156
We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year, but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with.	1.2896768740886628
What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations.	1.214804193924608
We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya.	1.1854758546669375
We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya.	1.423803192153304
We have large gaps in what we are arguing for, in principle, in relation to human rights.	1.1949487256889932
We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo, and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention.	1.1721398257404239
So, I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya.	1.542366088725805
What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end?	1.1397265173827782
We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them, but we are choosing not to use them.	1.2671101107964196
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, I have two questions for you, Mr Solana. How, with credibility, are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the Member States are not prepared to comply with common commitments?	1.4526185870352362
Meetings are all very well, but it is the result that counts.	1.5467978592757476
I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper.	1.0974308585883867
If we look around, the reality is that the CFSP is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk. Take, for example, Germany' s defence savings.	1.217271360492611
These are not only of concern to the defence minister, Mr Scharping. Instead, they also affect the whole of Europe.	1.4949013475303856
In my own country, Sweden, the objective, and the commitment towards playing our part, is to supply 2 500 men for EU operations.	1.2763402247608764
In the present situation, the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men, due to reduced defence spending.	1.161642610773
If we translate this number into figures for the EU countries as a whole, which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place, we shall not have 60 000 men but, at best, 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003.	1.4055614650946682
My second question concerns the following matter. Some weeks ago, you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media, whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters.	1.1148206365567093
I should like, however, to know the background to this, namely whether, as High Representative, you have been toying at all with the idea of giving Austria special treatment in the context of your assignment and, if so, on whose mandate and with how much leeway.	1.493050848405615
I am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the High Representative.	1.0994939275130469
I will not detain the Parliament for long but perhaps I could make one or two points and begin, which is sometimes rather dangerous in any Parliament, by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality.	1.293517565933385
Mrs Pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail I think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow.	1.0988071471661323
I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject.	1.0265126227109567
I spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the NATO parliamentary assembly and Members of this Parliament.	1.0301468774073528
Many of you were there on that occasion and I think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a knife among many of the NATO parliamentary delegates when we spoke about Europe' s ambitions in the area of CFSP.	1.2133696765812927
This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well.	1.1330877496840437
As I said in my remarks, I felt when I was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to laugh or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the High Representative' s remarks today were extremely encouraging.	1.4830635116678577
	-0.0
We have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time, but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves, for example, facing up to difficult questions about resources.	1.2718327579621074
Many people will argue that of course all that is required in Europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but I suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the Member States about whether that really is enough, about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own Union.	1.3898062737543928
I would just like to say a word about the non-military aspects of our security policy, of conflict prevention and crisis management.	1.2645808249288264
Rightly, the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that.	1.183659471417911
We will be bringing forward to the Council before Lisbon our proposals on a rapid reaction facility so that we can provide assistance where it is required, not in months or years, but in days or weeks.	1.4051033243193194
We are establishing a Commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative' s policy unit.	1.0047523253167527
Additionally, and this is for me the most important area of all, an area where we are breaking new ground, we will, soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility, be bringing forward proposals as well on non-military headline goals.	1.4331088058208634
It is, I repeat, breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in Kosovo, policing elsewhere, is the most dramatic and obvious example.	1.3972000302829153
It is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner.	1.1251665108380713
I grew up as a kid hoping I would be allowed to stay up on Saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community policeman called Dixon of Dock Green.	1.120715386273368
I have just been writing a report before I came to this job, and writing a very good report, just to respond to my honourable friend, on policing in part of my own country.	1.450131928853002
I remember talking about community policing to some American police experts and saying 'What in your view is the ideal community police officer' and the reply was 'a black grandmother' .	0.9994661218303398
But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo.	1.0837369522824496
We have armed forces, we have all got experience of training community police officers.	1.1749351374007069
What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing.	1.0411634432097798
We need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well.	0.939538098197761
That is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the European Union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences.	1.4047438842526936
So again, rhetoric and reality.	0.7136657914805886
Now Mr Titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate.	1.026849807321297
One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject.	1.1607586939176588
But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon.	0.9187520952926799
I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights, between neglecting habeas corpus, between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance, between tyranny and between environmental degradation.	1.1695604074172548
All those things come together.	0.542367015696087
We talk about the complexities of our eco-system but there is an eco-system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like Mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the Balkans as well.	1.2354891010960283
So, in the coming months, we will be producing communications from the Commission, for example, which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises.	1.585217051915214
We will be producing a communication shortly on an issue which this Parliament feels passionately about, that is, how we can ensure that election observation is conducted as comprehensively and sensibly as possible without diminishing the integrity of the institutions which do it.	1.1090094842893752
We will be producing a communication on anti-personnel landmines, actually the use of sensor equipment.	1.130340043165957
The work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in Mozambique.	1.201578704212821
They have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the wells, they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools.	0.8392409581188548
What does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days, moving those anti-personnel mines around?	1.1648187737832623
We are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise.	1.004001445819032
What we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that connects with our policies elsewhere.	1.2404601823997405
We have to be looking at what we do with the stocks of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine, in Moldova, the ecological consequences of dealing with those stocks, the financial consequences of dealing with those stocks, the political consequences of dealing with those stocks.	1.3123987180468064
So the point I want to make is that all these things are intimately related.	1.1978307826059966
We have all the instruments, we have all the instruments that we require but we have to pull them together much more effectively than we have in the past and that is the challenge which the High Representative and I face in the next four or five years.	1.5744832688375836
Now, I hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric.	1.3276602611674775
We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them - Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo.	1.2483653050767485
	-0.0
Those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the Balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians, quite a few senators and congressmen who say 'How can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep?' .	1.1334612591880457
So the big test for us is going to be in the Balkans. I hope that all those heads of government, all those prominent politicians in our Member States who promised the earth in the Balkans, who promised Marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the Balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the Balkans.	1.4203706599255872
I would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the European Council, the General Affairs Council and Ecofin.	1.4374975978371103
All on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver.	1.3050049603984424
In the last few months in this job I have heard promises that we will do more in Latin America, I have heard promises that if there is a Middle East peace settlement, we will be there to pay for it.	1.408399241085759
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses.	1.0329896360810804
I have heard promises that we will secure democracy in Indonesia by giving more assistance to Indonesia	0.8738283700501662
Where is the beef?	0.3112466502145991
And that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy.	1.2607775972806967
That is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view.	1.6478007535048895
One reason why I am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that I do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality, the response is 'Oh but we know you are not running things efficiently, we know that you have not spent all your commitments, we know there is some money in your back pocket' .	1.3709037080957842
I want us to be in a position in which we can say: 'It is not like that any more. We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can' .	1.5763036714877732
So, Member States, we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between Council conclusions, between yards of communiqués and what we can actually deliver on the ground and I think that if we can achieve that the job of the High Representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better.	1.446908186056881
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	0.618741388554918
I would also like to thank you for allowing us to sample your British sense of humour in the course of our dealings with this very difficult issue, for it makes things a little more interesting.	1.2251748938157785
Women in the decision-making process	0.2168665062204142
The next item is the declarations by the Council and the Commission on women in the decision-making process.	1.1345132396393618
Mr President, two centuries ago, during the French Revolution, a very famous woman, Olympe de Gouges, was executed and proclaimed mad because she had supported equal rights for men and women.	1.291132328102425
Two centuries later, we have achieved a great deal in Europe.	1.4682142461251948
The last century was marked by three periods.	0.7948543673650067
The first period was a period of institutional change, change in the legislative framework and huge constitutional victories in all the Member States as a result of the fight by the women' s movement, as a result of major decisions by progressive parties and as the result of action by enlightened men and women.	1.2923721150735774
This was followed by a second period, in which the worth of female models was recognised.	1.0296337672606222
There were women everywhere.	0.4387769478309426
Prime ministers, members of parliament, ministers, in the professional arena, doctors, lawyers, pilots, generals.	1.127767121107677
We are now in a third period: in this third period, the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed.	1.3222409696449602
The composition, or rather the change in composition, will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes.	1.2466791201124874
Ladies and gentlemen, the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events: the first was the election of the President of Finland, Mrs Halïnen.	1.4981166970948914
For the first time in Finland, the women candidates outnumbered the men.	1.1243290029475326
And a woman was elected.	0.5777856473209587
The second event took place in France, which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in April 1999 at the 'Women and Men in Power' conference, at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio.	1.3152842386720411
We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner.	0.887805941306517
A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States.	1.2628055393547917
But the figures tell the true story.	0.7365052191808024
And the figures still give Europe cause for concern.	0.6614846084383387
24% of members of government are women and there are an average of 22% in parliament, although this fluctuates from 6% in some Member States to as many as 40% in others.	1.4322771867729136
The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small.	0.9891060481180509
Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%.	1.3338607644131646
What we need, therefore, is to promote specific policies.	1.4568171943156154
We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively.	1.3401464078628391
We need organisation and statistical monitoring.	0.5993815490343064
We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture, mentality and specific problems of each area.	0.8319682815471099
And, of course, these policies need a budget, they need to be given financial teeth.	1.3725086803104865
Increasing the number of women or, as the French prime minister put it, increasing the influence of women in the decision-making centres, is the best way of renewing the policy, of reshaping the approach to the question, of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience: the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up.	1.421930665134442
The recent initiative by the Finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision-making centres is extremely important.	0.8866131480960362
These indicators include national parliaments, regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every Member State.	1.007164488255951
I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets, compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool.	1.2385289754469848
The programme which I shall present for the fifth women' s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring.	1.1757979532681635
Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned, the same cannot be said for the private sector.	1.3859376910209258
My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light.	0.910894184873583
There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2% of the directors and managers are women.	1.1946274914546655
Nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision-making centres.	0.955714269348045
Here too, specific efforts will be made of course; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature, but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices; in all cases, my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results.	1.3595714156022745
As you know, Europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within.	1.0162832262610073
A decision has already been taken on quotas of 40% for each sex on all teams and on all research and technological development programmes.	1.1021593082987353
It was approved by the House in May 1999, when the need for women in research and technology was stressed.	1.3081296016823942
We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together, as can be seen from the reform of the Commission, to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission.	1.5200692688436368
Ladies and gentlemen, there are often objections, crypto-progressive objections, as to whether there should be a binding undertaking on the representation of women at the centres of power.	1.1649274555280635
No one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say.	0.9789964443493371
And at the level of the European Union, the question of whether the 15 Member States need to be represented on every committee will never be asked.	1.2290529780270856
Why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population.	1.0524503429181506
I should like to be absolutely categorical.	1.5314132372790974
There should be no reservation, no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power.	0.8749169289752363
(Applause)	-0.0
Women make up half the population, half the strength of the planet.	0.8832963655641758
Excluding women from the centres of power means, first, democratic failure and, secondly, under-exploitation of human resources.	1.3375682696702544
We face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles.	1.1149215457334218
I am optimistic that we shall succeed.	1.2877219428883997
The bet before us is a bet with time.	0.8055262023191805
Future generations of women must not be sidelined.	0.8556998400838336
If need be, we must use all possible means to force the situation.	1.24458078297508
(Applause)	-0.0
Mr President, firstly I must thank Mrs Belém Roseira for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject.	1.3779994389879109
I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words.	1.2384851270219737
The various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under-represented in the decision-making process, in both the political and the economic and social spheres.	1.2228912001761763
Nobody nowadays disputes that women should participate in political life, in the parties and in the institutions but it is not easy to agree on how this participation should be achieved.	1.3774893176210108
The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work. This involves both equality in accessing work, which implies equality in training, and equal pay for the same work, so often defended and yet far from being achieved.	1.3752171980388248
We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole.	0.8606715421068979
Women always have a different viewpoint from men. This serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us, who are dedicated to active politics, undertake to solve.	1.1977386793595646
The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making.	1.1536720354728336
In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women.	1.176533695334827
However, this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men.	1.2825589875797776
Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent.	1.0942154244839792
The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women.	1.3565145689195484
There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women, who are ready and able, to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process.	1.347245218427956
There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system.	1.1374016934384346
Some Members have even come out against this.	0.798451782098749
Personally, I would not want to feel like a quota, to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman.	1.6885633948120216
This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference.	1.3634494607213994
Mr President, I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for good speeches on their part which I think provide hope for real optimism, especially given the will and commitment radiated by both women.	1.1648070209014687
I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women.	1.3626124659024808
It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear, what we are concerned with here.	1.2883677606692219
I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission - but then, of course, she is young and full of energy.	1.4021987262876736
I am convinced that it will be hard work, when all is said and done.	1.054448510639061
If the Commissioner asks for support from Parliament, she can in any case count upon the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	1.1150626455885726
We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality.	1.3181266705539691
I would say to the Portuguese minister that I completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power.	1.3156836549056592
That is absolutely crucial.	0.9139962897367864
It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women.	1.2870295098302569
Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children.	1.4619427038236148
Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today.	1.4876385609690193
Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves.	1.5867966936041638
What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides' surrendering power.	1.3635158036549417
The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden.	1.1698846319379639
Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark.	1.2427228124305196
And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark.	1.431083872889499
In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland.	1.4794755451908914
We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing.	1.429871213122964
I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources.	1.3065601567151515
It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term.	1.309665523416182
In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated.	1.124757354724358
The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures.	1.0102118997459206
One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments.	1.3269835839993247
I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures.	1.1933732240769757
In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up.	1.1892178010382077
There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally.	1.2937845619987867
The first is the issue of the media' s influence.	1.1399599166657237
I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish.	1.016532123403008
Do we have a special problem in this regard?	1.7025423281757468
I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question.	1.021588680055621
I have a suspicion that this is the case, but I am not certain.	1.7871974159605646
The second point is the enlargement of the Union.	0.9121723266072668
I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned.	1.4081983973146601
I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner' s statement; it is time that fine words were translated into action.	1.2309338668614251
We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves.	1.237611737641999
I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems.	1.2561397185024634
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this.	0.699417586745257
Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process.	0.8808506801593907
In the meantime, we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures.	1.4078260379834493
We can learn from the successes mentioned, not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected, but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system.	1.3498630561052611
I am pleased to say that in Wales, which I represent, 40% of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but, on the other hand, we have only 4 women MPs from Wales in the House of Commons which is only 10% of the total; so statements of principle, of support in principle, are not enough because they have not worked.	1.4467482183512603
If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen.	1.3441209293887182
Mr President, at the Second International Conference of Socialist Women held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided that the main demand of the time, that of a woman' s right to vote, should be linked to the women' s question as a whole and that (as also stated in the relevant resolution) Women' s Day must be accorded an international dimension and be thoroughly prepared for.	1.3991612123262251
It is also worth noting that International Women' s Day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years.	1.1772029009303158
In 1910, a woman' s right to vote was on the agenda.	1.0778626034523597
Today, we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process.	1.120589484040191
Women are no homogenous collective.	0.5891778098173522
Women belong to different social classes.	0.6543723795121025
Women have different individual needs and interests.	0.6841573585574595
Irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class, race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work, it is nonetheless a fact that, in all areas of society, the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men (albeit with a few individual exceptions, it is perhaps best to add).	1.3446803076252387
In my own country, Sweden, a number of political parties have, in recent years, voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run.	1.013213282975432
This has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which, in turn, has provided opportunities for further research.	1.0975731332633591
What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making?	0.9001862959786917
What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes, so too of course do the types of decisions made.	1.4409351748131294
When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender, the word "qualifications" also crops up.	1.0709895539074539
What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined.	0.8635658928170519
It often looks as if men today, as in the past, always have the least defined qualifications.	1.236388834269817
Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence.	1.2552606534440494
This way of seeing things I consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today' s decision makers.	1.163400963693716
Earlier this year, we requested, here in this Chamber, that 8 March be made into an international holiday.	1.3501251262276097
In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the "Women' s World Marches" which are to begin this spring on International Women' s Day.	1.348889322386673
This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world.	1.0105697880908235
Finally, I want to say, as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close, that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother.	1.4098675430996954
We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found.	1.4452511384846078
Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness.	1.2518690774059165
Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics.	0.6571426712738162
It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible.	1.1357443113179913
In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors.	0.8997522072120182
The vast majority of them are not members of any party.	1.039886193374845
In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories.	1.3273128324097583
In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected.	1.5100293896416415
But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates.	0.9007339810245468
Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union.	1.0103500573226405
That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities.	1.341051286375502
The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system.	1.4289633757935478
On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses.	1.3165909565839993
The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women.	1.2521377914584761
With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions.	1.0447031365213257
It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation.	1.103291780612564
The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs.	1.025461244646616
On the other hand, such a policy shows a deep contempt for women.	1.1046691548814578
A woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised.	0.9438728308614872
Ladies, have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota?	1.120581161807394
Women deserve more than a quota.	0.8485634043221341
It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality.	1.1066138549950795
Minister, Commissioner, everything you have just said has been very well expressed, even if a few male colleagues, if there are still any in the Chamber, perhaps gnashed their teeth.	1.4842017757874277
I know that there are also some women who do not wish to hear of quotas or even of positive action, because they believe that this positive discrimination humiliates them and marks them forever in their careers.	1.2633743314376824
But the statistics prove it: the positive action, even the quotas, - if they are not applied blindly, without distinction - have increased the number of women in the decision-making process.	1.416182160783283
That is why we are justified in stating that the use of quotas, as a transitional measure, contributes to balancing out the participation of men and women, particularly in political life.	1.1881424700242906
I should like to take this opportunity to remind the Commissioner of some requests and initiatives of this Parliament which her predecessor did not follow up and which are closer to our hearts than the quotas.	1.2373254558950593
First of all it concerns our report, which was adopted last year on the occasion of International Women' s Day in Strasbourg, which requests the Commission to submit to us a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women.	1.4610618266150033
According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right, and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically.	1.3013297201666334
Things being what they are, nobody should dare any longer to dispute that the right of equality of men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society, requiring equal treatment and equal opportunity be achieved by a package of active measures, including positive action.	1.2654114970260384
Therefore, Commissioner, you can go ahead.	1.5642577450643615
You do not need to wait for a new amendment to the Treaty.	1.261361087906879
May I just remind you once again of our request for an amendment to the 1976 directive which has been watered down and misapplied with regard to the equal treatment of self-employed people, including assistant spouses.	1.1725013004770128
No action has been taken on our report which unanimously proposed a European framework status for assistant spouses.	1.0755757966763344
Here again, Commissioner, the ball is in your court.	1.189853959468331
Do not take too long to send it back.	0.9900287805114377
I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the European Parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today.	1.354040315217067
The presence of women in decision-making bodies, in particular, is a question of democracy.	1.2821662271076089
All citizens, both men and women, should be able to see, to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule.	1.338311036781495
If we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision-making bodies, it is clear that we are still far from true democracy.	1.3704257806100275
However, it is also a question of political agendas.	1.3953356330439484
In addition to making up the majority of the population, women are also the most dynamic element in society: it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men, and in many of our regions, they are the main feature of the innovation, training, performance and flexibility development model.	1.3373207823215032
Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan, where I live, 90% said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day.	1.2518484496434499
Women work an average of 60 hours a week, which is 20 hours longer than men.	1.1828878715714926
The price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time.	0.9666188047401146
If this is true, and it is, any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point.	1.24445073142472
Laws, programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed, coordinated and audacious, in order to encourage the formation of new cultural, economic, social, institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women.	1.0691532718113226
Much has been achieved on many issues in Europe, but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation.	1.295483749836515
I agree with the Commissioner that it is time for the European political sphere - the entire European political sphere - to represent women and men on an equal footing, and for decisive action to be taken in this matter.	1.5714397692057638
Mr President, before I came here for today' s sitting, I was watching Finnish television.	1.4752403392681521
In Finland, an honorary company of the Finnish army was saluting the new President of the Republic, with the words "Good morning, Madam President."	1.4200094728338872
You perhaps know that, in Finland, the president is not just the leading public figure or political leader, but she is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, so this was quite an interesting and historic occasion.	1.4720645950482878
During the Finnish presidential term, a report was produced that reveals an image of the whole decision-making process, and, on the basis of this report, I hope that the Commissioner proposes legally binding ways of improving the position of women in decision making.	1.388222056228817
I urge you all, women of the Right, to listen to Mrs Lulling, because she told us why quotas were needed and, if any of us has sufficient experience of political life, it is she.	1.5223647240619158
Finally, I would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.183912309683165
I appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen, not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4, to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2372278480261083
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, despite the progress made in terms of legislation and despite the complaints that we all utter from time to time on the subject of sexual inequality and sexual discrimination, the causes of these practices are still present in the amendments that have been tabled to this resolution. This means that we need to amend policies in various areas if we are to guarantee that women can participate on equal terms in the decision-making process.	1.2812491154301868
We know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve, both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility.	1.3066991667850052
The truth is that the scant participation of women in centres of political representation and decision making demonstrates a democratic deficit which is incompatible with genuine democracy.	0.9694524492716089
It is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the Council, the Commission and each Member State strictly to respect the commitments they have made, particularly at the Beijing Conference.	1.476277461241064
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am a right-wing Member of Parliament but I have the same battles as my colleagues in supporting and assisting fellow citizens in my country to gain power and access to decision-making posts, which should be feasible not only in the political arena but clearly also in all sectors of society.	1.3380893523594528
Quite simply, I would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and I am particularly against the system of quotas, because I believe it is especially contemptuous of women and I come from a country where parity has just been achieved.	1.4646203423589481
It is quite logical, it is consistent!	1.5225274217466942
It should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50%, if not more, of those within decision-making bodies and, inter alia, in the political arena.	1.4233699354638043
So, there should be no positive discrimination to include women.	1.2265421556695582
Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense.	0.8092198934043102
When I see that we are asking for training for women in politics, I want to say - no, definitely not.	1.4347653777338054
Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training?	1.0744409816981517
That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority.	0.5607803729357587
But I do know that we have never felt inferior to men, particularly in politics.	1.402988870672761
So I believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow countrywomen to achieve decision-making power, to gain responsible posts in the political arena, but I believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think.	1.408133176782014
We shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women' s participation in the political decision-making process.	1.0183641222515505
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, "Women are half of heaven" , a successful man once said.	1.3807686263644428
But when it comes to important decisions and priorities, there is a lack of women' s voices.	1.0947642582056263
Women, who constitute more than half of the population, are heavily under-represented within political, economic and social fields.	1.3082085575051026
That is unacceptable in a democracy.	0.9875657701796773
Where equality is concerned, the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making.	1.1080320408332243
If we are to achieve a balance, a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required.	1.2907660860384804
An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women' s full participation in power structures and decision making.	1.1025025787940903
I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind.	1.2298736654011042
I propose that the EU' s objectives for women in the area of decision making should be based upon the averaged-out achievements of the three most successful Member States within each area, with the Member States each submitting a report annually which will then have to be evaluated.	1.361330868388622
Women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape, sexual offences, domestic violence and the trade in women, but they are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies which pronounce upon these crimes.	1.182881193611108
The latter are consequently accorded low priority, and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted.	1.2182410544232078
Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under-represented in peace-keeping efforts, conflict resolution and reconstruction work.	0.9667092274104918
In the resolution, we therefore urge the Member States to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace-keeping.	1.3385550554176078
The call for women' s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy; it is also essential if women' s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full.	1.239209660519491
Not to use women' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste.	1.052473813141069
Women should not only be "half of heaven" but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet.	1.150367720478598
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today.	1.0942832160614642
We have high hopes for what you will achieve.	0.8365818210404287
We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions.	1.1530800479838568
We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large, we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women, and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today.	1.2903211729579493
Furthermore, we want values that women consider important, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security and environmental protection, to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and, if possible, throughout the world.	1.5655813587218683
In order to achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has, until now, been essentially imbued with masculine values.	1.215314551764385
We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for.	1.0232654574880307
Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory: not over men, not over anyone, but the victory of equality between men and women.	1.3308763589050663
We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities, and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now, and particularly women, concerns the new economy and the new information technologies.	1.4058226894231476
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women.	1.231417950227782
The rate of employment in Europe, which is much lower than in the United States and Japan, must be increased.	1.3443000234985483
We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall.	1.694174439844929
I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit to ensure that the new economy and the new Europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women.	1.3123786517459473
Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why I was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the Member States where the political representation of women is a success, such as, for example, in Finland, France and Sweden, and equally, you had the courage to list the Member States where things in this respect are not going so well, such as, for example, my own country and Greece too, which you forgot to mention.	1.4402693385728944
Moreover, I have heard that for the next elections, it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece.	1.5274332003944402
I think this is a very sad state of affairs.	1.0959313471043417
I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda.	1.2740024655136908
This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution.	1.4487323533917935
I myself, Commissioner, am a product of quotas. I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result.	1.3527014750020727
It appears that the meritocracy in a number of our European countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance.	1.101111460964108
It is true that a number of countries in the European Union have already introduced quotas, and you yourself made reference to Belgium, Commissioner, where it has not really taken off.	1.5700482977156611
Hardly surprising, would you not agree, Mrs Avilés Perea, not because we failed to find the necessary candidates, but because recent scientific research, instigated by the Commission, has shown that quotas are, in fact, only useful if women are placed in the appropriate safe seats.	1.4842425730837423
This is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas.	1.1219937627675864
Indeed, Minister, we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract.	1.427987765937904
But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this.	1.0353729592810619
The electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one-for-one system, as is being applied in Sweden on a voluntary basis.	1.281352506868653
I would suggest the following: where possible, apply it on a voluntary basis, where there is reluctance, impose it.	1.123442391779766
I hope that in the fifth action programme, Minister and Commissioner, benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through, for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this.	1.4417106633072525
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council for their solid recommendations and, above all, for their proposals.	1.3421534217233948
Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women' s rights, I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, to today' s debate.	1.3026340866225725
In an article entitled "If women ruled the world" , he maintains that if women were more involved in politics, the world would certainly not be so wedded to violence.	1.26096118340808
Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, may have been a female model in Ancient Greece, but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace.	1.2876211642706976
There are, therefore, serious grounds, over and above justice between the sexes, for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women.	1.1175739870439734
Women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue, reconciliation, an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means.	1.059087129307272
These female virtues can offer an alternative to today' s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone.	1.0157784328570596
That is why the Intergovernmental Conference must introduce into the Treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the European Union and in all democratic institutions and political decision-making centres throughout the Community.	1.4513480469971864
Mr President, why do women need their rightful share in political decision making?	1.1799404730206666
And how should we achieve this?	0.7893448902455368
We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary.	1.5508888471041375
It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and, as such, a condition for political legitimacy.	1.406891334209561
But if we look into how to achieve this, the opinions are greatly divided.	1.2719846551424734
Is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment, much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties?	1.2687099828592001
And is it then up to the state, in other words the legislative, to impose such measures on political parties?	1.392213826183005
Or should we even consider a system in which 50% of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies?	1.0429586769231278
This discussion, which is being held in some parts of Europe and here too under the French banner of parité, touches the very core of democracy, and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman.	1.3034495342750156
In my opinion, the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level.	1.0809467538967936
I am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists, without which, in fact, I would not be here today.	1.4215180881967888
Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure.	1.253621295981734
In my opinion, though, the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties, at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself.	1.1726791339789135
In other words, the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid.	1.027344686714123
We would, in this way, violate democracy.	0.9040188385113147
Mr President, today' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision-making bodies and changes to the decision-making system in Europe.	1.2115503864221255
We have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors, education, work, culture.	1.2060084601807002
The problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision-making centres.	1.2661606113266854
The debate is a deeply political one.	1.1645976951698396
There are two approaches.	0.9878287876758682
The first is a policy of persuasion.	1.1849207112747047
Gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved.	0.838258242568369
Three comments: the first is based on the fact that women are able. I can, therefore all women can.	1.587682449215452
How do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded?	1.0468581971817976
