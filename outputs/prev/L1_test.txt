I believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in Amendment No 4.	4.543804804668111
For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.	3.843454502520359
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	0.23935853513002717
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out.	3.67704242642387
We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters.	6.025290137607756
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio.	4.741386772451858
What are the scenarios for development and the potential risks?	3.687050578447689
A programme such as INTERREG is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders, projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale.	5.163627808534666
The Council has behaved in an unseemly manner, changing tack in mid-course, and is nowhere to be seen.	5.342426524361312
I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage.	3.735339677713247
Seven, to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency: for example, in reforestation following storm damage, or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick, etc.	4.103807102762076
The previous speaker already said something about this.	4.320661430274453
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons?	3.634235793026318
Neither outcome would be satisfactory.	4.02952776733196
How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters?	5.1369746210540885
And to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient?	5.619827815253294
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	0.37074230123348767
Thirdly, one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground.	5.463261764743006
Madam President, my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today, particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about.	4.463454266817573
The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy.	4.220226817993402
Mr President, I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today.	4.416732665422635
These should indeed be excluded from the directive. Secondly, the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars.	4.708170124566002
Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights.	6.641536902309191
Secondly, in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years, we consider that the main question to be considered by the Commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the EU which neither the programme nor the motion mention.	4.159559297868055
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions.	5.042550923469579
My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed, especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens, as the Commissioner has explained very well.	3.243321040700433
When we have the chance to ask direct questions, the questions which Mr BÃ¶ge referred to will be asked.	4.674900111241624
It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected.	4.7597177581061105
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.	6.606835836823792
I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead.	4.497075790657319
Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard.	6.391672783528581
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report.	2.713049766878696
It marks the beginning, rather than the end, of a process.	2.5981620527430866
The transfer of water is already covered by controls, but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer.	5.213626079770213
As far as Cyprus is concerned, part of the technical and financial aid provided for in the instruments will be used to bring the Greek and Turkish communities closer together and solve the problem of the partition of the island once and for all.	3.764907050663618
There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development.	3.28955078319001
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed, you will be doing us a great service.	4.391610131701857
The outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions, to the extent that we are providing you with options.	4.700942645546841
I am waiting for the Commission' s report on the ultra-peripheral regions, which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999.	4.090341142863082
. The European Union is currently in the process of adopting new EU water legislation to update and to establish a long-term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters.	4.43683898669602
This well-known phrase, which is taken from the conclusions of the UN World Conference on human rights of 1993, is known off by heart by many.	5.516178160823891
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	0.6045807360608809
The recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe, on the contrary.	3.5829843114037865
I now come to the EQUAL initiative, which is, of course, based on Article 13.	1.7662421356407818
This is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency.	3.3197470971286087
Secondly, Cuba.	2.094331097414083
I wish insistently to remind the Council and, should it be necessary, Parliament, that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing.	3.8850148493680337
We understand the context of this essential debate.	4.373897582995301
That is important, for at least three reasons.	3.1180842271610656
But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe.	4.846780912759398
I sincerely hope that, in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East, all the key protagonists will move forward quickly, in the very near future, so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved.	3.3994728977394444
Mr President, Commissioner, as far as restructuring goes, there is no doubt that European companies must adapt so that they are better placed to face new challenges or go under.	4.355838875867184
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed.	4.821183523271452
I do not like the term 'leftovers' any more than Richard Corbett does.	4.946585842066415
Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure.	2.6408110373950504
On the question of the indigenous peoples in the US, I am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the US authorities will have been noted by them.	4.380495288068171
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another.	5.94411115545537
Berend Report (A5-0107/1999)	1.0606987755416954
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge, the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997.	5.135736070577042
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Council Presidency' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness.	4.403480804261389
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission.	4.462029554714659
This is why, Madam President, I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words, so that nobody, absolutely nobody, can use this message, which is unusual and unwise, to say the least, to contribute, and that includes counter to the intentions of Mr Prodi, towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in Austria a commonplace.	5.143785066525651
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, turned a deaf ear to this Parliament.	4.590761883633621
(PT) Mr President, I would like to make a few very brief comments on behalf of the Council presidency, and first to remind you that the work done by the presidency is above all about coordination and about seeking common positions on initiatives that the fifteen Member States are to approve in the Council. Our experience of previous sessions of the Human Rights Commission suggests - precisely by virtue of this coordinating role played by successive presidencies - that the European Union is very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the Commission, and it is important to maintain this.	4.4011073919515065
The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration.	4.345808786034039
There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system.	3.5846840611379784
Secondly, we have to have realistic targets, but targets nevertheless.	4.424031601127626
We explicitly address corruption; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever.	5.139937314272363
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.	5.062520363409001
For this reason, we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently.	3.400240339714793
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards, we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed'.	6.108918803927864
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.	3.1606833086832586
We are making an overall value judgement about NATO' s action, and this overall value judgement is positive. We agree with the general view of NATO' s action.	4.943141342187361
In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway.	2.2892484281406746
During these years, the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport.	4.865829372131506
The debate is closed.	0.026223728884438406
These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement.	3.956723542435579
For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees.	4.290678607596121
With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel, the situation could still deteriorate.	5.45527809498454
This is in place too.	2.9367242705785053
What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list?	4.148738402434342
Use of ICT opens a completely new dimension in the context of travel and tourism.	3.106840583311845
This is not the case!	1.1218704695125492
They have all been persuaded!	2.3957245471667963
For the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy, but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy, in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others, democracy and democratic life.	5.273291969931591
In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.	4.8549836097934636
However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.	5.358315549373617
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.	5.216794678139256
What about women?	1.9213389908135539
I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition.	4.212131916519022
I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up, but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure.	2.5216176487629185
We ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100% in the near future, which is indeed what the new Convention is aiming at.	4.561134378732171
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal?	1.891648280128559
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States.	6.560585014906688
Non-least-developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements.	4.188012985331371
Mr President, I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which, as you are all so very well aware, led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission.	4.449354978756741
We will therefore vote for the Greens' Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position.	5.004465457397677
Because we are aware that the developing global economic situation, and particularly the single market, can force businesses to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings, which often take the form of cross-border proceedings, the Union itself is fully justified in equipping itself with the binding legal instruments it needs to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structural principles, thus ensuring that they are carried out swiftly.	4.818083211184055
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved.	2.0886216952590284
I must not go on about books, but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues, in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies, going back millennia.	6.173538291582
In that spirit, we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos.	4.845892852442841
How will we judge, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, the five years of our mandate?	3.0057830406794825
Regardless of who is to blame - and we are not here to apportion blame, the relevant United Nations resolutions in this area are clear enough - I believe that we should take advantage of the opportunities that the new situation is opening up, in more of a rational way and less of an emotional one.	5.241769860618731
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed.	3.0053495938698016
We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	5.246580607669691
It is, moreover, also accepted as an important and effective tool.	3.6057338687479135
I would like to remind you of one thing: it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here.	3.6748990240917907
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification.	4.73120426093358
I hope there has been an interpretation error, and that he will clarify the matter in his follow-up speech.	4.792284304698929
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments.	4.7649171641709644
Moreover, an adequate contribution from different economic sectors, broken down into industrial, household and agricultural sectors, must ensure that this policy is implemented.	5.467890305875696
Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible.	4.003503937017647
We, the Green Group, by and large support the common position.	3.4830321370122013
In my Group, there are undoubtedly different views of Mr Di Pietro' s report.	3.1033980572617503
Under no circumstances can we, as responsible politicians, allow what is currently happening to continue, with young girls practically bought in the countries of the East and coming here to be abused on the cheap.	5.23049976293191
Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that, in her report, she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes, which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now, to supplement and improve the text.	4.599310175984879
There is no legal basis, and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector.	3.159491642481928
This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying, especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union' s rural development policy.	4.612870650196451
We are seeking to implement best practice.	2.7921482278672074
Let us grab our chance.	4.42550843086213
But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies.	5.010131271626053
And what about vehicles which are already on the road?	3.2528843388872675
Moreover, it is important to uphold the concept that it is not possible to make a surface categorisation of entire fishing sections as more environmentally friendly: in reality, in some cases, small-scale fishing has less of an impact on the environment and natural resources.	4.5726929481270995
There are many opportunities to hide.	4.023470698911607
The EU is also a union for employment and social justice.	4.553848635775901
There are still, needless to say, many unresolved problems and unanswered questions, also involving the Palestinians.	4.023671217281729
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one.	5.077461469980255
On behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have tabled an amendment to the motion for a resolution which asks the Council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible.	2.1428862166309326
In the course of the debate, many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed.	3.2315660771392936
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court.	3.3705354056690844
How do you aim to eradicate homophobia, racism and sexism?	4.461372449886775
It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts.	5.80028453183654
Mrs Rothe, I would put it this way: I am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind.	4.198171995297433
He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners.	4.6953488346665795
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament' s more drastic positioning.	4.123872932326236
It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme.	4.02565280672004
And I believe that it is our responsibility, in an ever more rapidly moving economy, where everyone must have a real opportunity, to give people the chance of running a commercial enterprise, and a second and a third chance, if necessary.	5.34776594610158
We shall now proceed to the vote.	0.21318492262959154
Mr President, a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service.	4.469416770477968
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	2.950494936031261
A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more.	4.8215274741580645
The first consideration must be to recognise that Community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced.	4.5159038700120435
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].	1.5977353610253693
The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view.	3.922135741760378
Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base, whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152.	3.352501307095272
If you do not, we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you, exactly as we did with the seed directive. I should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise, both for your legal service and ours.	5.016863375042084
They urgently need aid such as food, water and shelter in order to survive.	4.365699771289565
A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14, or even fewer?	4.603415637827988
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense.	4.3891011325703175
That is true and potentially valuable, although I have to say - and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked.	4.868539670181285
Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your interventions today.	2.628628391832012
Secondly, does he not agree that were the current government, at a national level, to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level, then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6(1) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action?	4.760513464331646
I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly, particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May.	2.8676775804603625
In this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention, which succeeds the LomÃ© Convention, is an important instrument of renewal, and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process, as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle.	4.70453366983338
It only remains to put this principle into practice.	5.1827643131387
One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union.	5.306249075846912
We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage.	4.618151929890884
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority.	5.769374312510117
My message to you is: do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content.	5.110870776383896
Mr President, esteemed gentlemen from Portugal, especially the Council representatives, you face great expectations on our part.	5.189495608714002
In the past, this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.	5.039149592072288
With regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean, natural groundwater.	3.4789285510445715
As far as specific policies are concerned, I would like to pinpoint just one on which the draft resolution focuses - regional policy.	4.520828445560555
I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland, a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue.	5.0802420480517245
Commissioner Monti, the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships: postal services must be improved, not run down.	4.12665232820297
My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs.	2.652614713994922
It is therefore important that regulation of derivatives is flexible so that the market is not tied down ahead of future developments.	4.990649695386677
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this.	4.833870860294083
Subject: Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict?	5.59494070848539
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons.	3.7773906489472626
But his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together.	4.756739832181455
Then the content: the Council draft fudges the obvious difficulty caused by widely differing legal systems, varying practices and a total lack of legal public service standards in certain Member States of the Union.	6.033127931479463
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again!	5.96336855583906
The first thing we need to do in this area is to give these stateless people the legal means to live a decent life and be able to work without being relegated to the status of pariahs, the victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple forms of administrative and police harassment, the main form of which is having to live in permanent fear of expulsion.	5.167265305881028
I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to find the information, the political will to provide genuine long-term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short-termism.	5.059619105914542
This is why I give this report my full support.	4.5277575838450534
It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue.	5.181321981509803
It is about co-operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides.	5.372898841142836
The Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment.	5.281913131410906
I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years, and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon.	3.755147314235434
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will.	4.75001005927755
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast.	5.732877955472101
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, since I know the history of the Balkans, I should like to remind you that, for many decades, the peoples of Yugoslavia lived in peace.	2.782740494958385
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context.	3.663600364424016
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one' s own interests.	4.514757783079598
We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which, at the same time, safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development.	4.016787511198882
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change.	5.172503233519218
When INTERREG is implemented, it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned.	4.198419572942293
The two proposals form a coherent whole.	4.268130790043699
Regarding their content, as you know, ladies and gentlemen of this House, they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but, at the same time, very passionately, as I understood her presentation just now.	4.446900873802666
For me this raises the following questions: who will work there?	3.7179471018630745
This report contains 34 conclusions, including 15 calls to the Commission to adopt specific measures and actions without forgetting the environmental dimension and cultural protection, particularly in outermost and island regions.	5.644193298464579
This adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the Member States more precisely.	4.815763529077736
Community policy in the field of water (continuation)	2.1132612617602047
This seems a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the ACP states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new LomÃ© arrangement.	5.253673382512542
All this should make it possible for us, apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them, to confirm the role of 'active frontier' of the Union.	3.8863049800575937
All we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme, one after the other.	4.9128616706943316
Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.	5.509874798247808
The best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and/or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost.	4.475181987425544
In order to ensure that at least 50% of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources, it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term.	3.94453545736439
I assume, therefore, that the EU will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total, worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance.	3.866658477617883
For this reason, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho.	1.8769270555548732
And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need.	3.7153256507272983
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities.	3.820497264248651
Without any hesitation, the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs, Vladimir Rushailo, earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question.	5.073605884255506
We all have a duty to put our own house in order.	1.4760783209658719
More than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998.	5.12102367174878
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so.	3.76366075389948
In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities.	5.392733435775128
The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees, I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst.	4.604958957235887
Questions to Mr Barnier	1.1939829488707856
This is even more important given that there is no clear proof that BSE and scrapie are unrelated.	4.641234512922784
We clearly have different views, one of which is that we believe the development of the European economy can be regarded with confidence.	3.7340971279797706
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today.	3.1948121297551038
The lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full, and decisions must be taken speedily at Community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or berthing in our ports, to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants, and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection.	5.636921446516495
We cannot allow our European water to be polluted, Mr President, and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water, which is so precious to all of us.	4.029394273705393
This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification.	4.981035150114827
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimising the nature of the internal market.	4.3008462368592415
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but, in reality, we have made little progress.	4.445315358665423
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	0.8317670640329281
In my opinion, this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control.	4.115853987068828
The interlinking of the EU institutions, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well.	3.0373706141486223
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses.	2.7878416622641615
However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.	5.2870148671647765
Madam President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago.	3.106061503273286
In so doing, we would not only embarrass the United States into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to UN funding, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric.	4.90841112321609
The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings, abductions, detentions, intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc.	6.349179835210554
Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that.	4.034836218347158
You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system, as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications, in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and, above all, in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure.	4.6883030599938325
You have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to.	6.558869784810921
Secondly, there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented.	4.66460833205468
The Council has already, on various occasions, stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by NATO were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions.	5.094483297737518
That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government.	4.900656833342269
Moreover, given that this opinion is quite important, we can still vote for it, and indeed, the majority of our group will be voting for it.	3.837538606178491
To a certain extent, they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and, in any case, I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.	3.6349434838589407
However, if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy, go ahead!	2.6112772777622744
Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment.	1.4549370444209022
That is important.	0.614547639889824
However, before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations, let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented.	3.8207368698966246
The victim of this exchange is said to be the 35-year-old war correspondent of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Andrey Babitsky.	5.35051626678391
Mr President, we are partly to blame for this war.	2.799097863627116
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million, mainly for food, medical supplies, water and sanitation.	4.654423738621365
These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development.	4.408201582269315
We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up.	5.295797861491879
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us.	5.458265406037596
This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon, causing death.	5.6279586361564125
It also reminds us of the need for a new growth model, one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the Catholics who are involved in social problems, who see, in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public, the most natural instruments for building solidarity.	4.999481946403996
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.	5.917792788588792
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals.	5.34383960151782
It is not something, I assure you, which I would wish to make a practice of.	4.044106480888455
The proposal, when it is put forward, will take account of the points of view of Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties, all of whom have been involved in an in-depth consultation process.	3.767314407663965
It will be easier to take account of the developing countries' very diverse problems, and EU aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if, as the report makes quite clear, we take the urgently needed step of optimising our working methods, by introducing the proposed regional assemblies.	5.61873005984272
If other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project, more resources would, moreover, be required than are available in the present situation.	4.928667630513341
Mr President of the Commission, this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament, a five-year programme following the crisis of the Commission.	3.8124489435913835
Furthermore, we should utilise an extraordinary budget line, since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation.	4.787828451259654
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year, which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session.	5.308549581011009
We must be sure that, in seeking allies in the area, we must not always choose anyone who offers.	4.14073203329987
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.	3.1668939552015107
I consider technical support to be necessary but, given the problems with the former TAOs, no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level.	5.468873949236053
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility".	5.71885470029948
One of the EU' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market.	3.0910972986396548
Two centuries later, we have achieved a great deal in Europe.	3.3740962795994203
Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue, while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage.	4.839808374918144
The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union' s relations with Cambodia.	4.381545508027787
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.	2.320046165826487
I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has.	4.199625472236735
It is precisely this which, in a sense, is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme.	4.49675191140783
An amendment was therefore made in the committee, but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form.	4.817929354285393
Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission.	5.01349754821148
Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission.	4.005765917096142
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations, lay down clear rules, which will benefit all of us: businesspeople, investors, workers and the citizens in general.	4.752779492212174
Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace.	4.690852157688891
Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment.	4.627246036218622
They clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email.	5.26142780427014
We are extremely concerned about moves by the Cuban Government over the last year that have further curtailed public freedom, moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty.	5.238538591673979
Mr President, Commissioner, when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation, we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly.	4.5014294882332795
Other issues have been mentioned: cattle-farming in Namibia, tomatoes and milk powder in the Caribbean.	3.7480182777574766
Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident, as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too.	5.472884202087376
Moreover, the European welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation.	3.8451102110842754
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.	3.2128356751897003
The ship was sinking and the captain realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port.	5.62153154893647
It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition.	3.2232916895053334
Last year, Parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four, and the two applicant States are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant States from Central and Eastern Europe, as they, in fact, should be, according to the declarations from the Helsinki Summit.	4.108532990667493
. Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte and congratulate him on the report.	1.7122069417292003
Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities.	4.717990805055935
First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes.	4.790232163464333
Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States' election processes?	5.6471897287261195
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document.	4.065950827799326
The debate is closed.	0.026223728884438406
That is what I should like to say by way of introduction.	3.0003196477046212
Accordingly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative, so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month. Rather, we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country, and I hope that in the process, you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months.	4.615687389761071
Secondly, looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report later this evening, paragraph 28 is of particular importance.	3.098103454189456
Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the 'Crisex 2000' exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation?	4.673218451407945
That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries.	4.437811047783144
Madam President, this morning the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years, laudable aims indeed, to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world: succeeding with enlargement, meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe, introducing better principles of governance.	4.598543141006898
I am also very sympathetic towards Amendment No 9, but I believe that it can be better formulated so as to join, at the same time, environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies.	4.229983982857242
Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what' but more 'what are we doing together' ?	5.260160548346712
In my view, instead of "weitergefÃ¼hrt werden mÃ¼ssen" the wording should be "erhalten bleiben mÃ¼ssen" .	5.051325981177661
I am therefore voting against the proposal.	2.714934721480298
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening.	3.5124502140303195
As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned, I am of the opinion that the Councils' objectives lack both commitment and ambition.	4.719016597130324
Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks. This is one of the goals of your reform.	5.143723097195121
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified, as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union, meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria' s.	3.6405569441107373
I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.	2.59231044631042
Take, for example, the car manufacturing sector, where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period.	4.672831023167945
The reform is important but, if it aggravates the situation, reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the Commission, then the structure of European integration, as planned by the founding fathers for the European Commission, will be at risk.	4.562667685507749
When it comes to pollution, like sin, we are all against it, but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good.	6.152016225959325
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate.	4.903325848403653
Opinion multipliers, political groups and parties, MEPs and national MPs, elected representatives, as I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved.	4.896754114335351
The Commission should not, for example, take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to, as some have suggested, as low as 50 grammes.	4.63985791846039
Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee.	4.67811735419878
Finally, I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views.	3.485147355726477
The Commission and Parliament can help us understand, in the first place, exactly what we are dealing with, because even the term 'tourism' , as was, moreover, pointed out in the Viceconte report, is still an ambiguous term, a kind of variable that depends on latitude, climate, a range of opportunities, and a series of background factors; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production, income, wealth and employment.	4.25017371417913
The debate is closed.	0.026223728884438406
This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment.	5.1361359893651075
Finally, intervention by the European Union to solve the problem of FYROM' s name - which is unfortunately becoming a long drawn out problem and could make an already tense situation even more fraught - and to respond more energetically towards negotiating FYROM' s principles within a reasonable time scale, is necessary and useful.	5.578682712235819
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women.	5.258034764298102
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States.	3.7640365148035917
If they are proven not to be, we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority.	4.146348305811635
Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft, which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998?	6.114870644179722
This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses.	4.019784703607412
I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week.	5.2238633235383745
The amount of budget required by our cities - where 80% of the European population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in Europe, I believe, clearly indicates that the European dimension should be taken into account and that this URBAN programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail, not to prioritise and, therefore, not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities, by means of European funds.	4.837789699086094
The matter of excise taxes, to which the honourable Member is referring, is the prerogative of the Member State concerned.	3.0175341159499975
That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process.	3.8738029380061256
However, despite the fact that the volume is relatively small, it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action, which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments. This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources, greater safety in our energy supplies and, in the case of SAVE, to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy, thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set.	5.09868981860601
So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction, together with Parliament.	2.921994103209246
Policy on tourism is not, however, something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the European Parliament or by the EU as a whole.	3.3850585126908275
(IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy' s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined.	5.044850394665927
Reform of European competition policy	1.4421627415370044
I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks, and that is why I am reiterating them here.	3.247175383771972
Nevertheless, it raises some very basic questions.	5.484705381742258
If anything, the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO" .	3.1444226844340464
Mr Crowley, with regard to the presidency' s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations, particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless, I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome, and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them.	2.8645125848432995
It is on the last two that the elderly, in particular, depend.	2.8837578012939544
Already weak economies are being further weakened in Africa by the AIDS virus.	5.390533138900127
First of all, the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement contains, as everyone knows, a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel' s commitments. This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements.	4.61060953784256
The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences.	4.182233884684948
That is why today we are asking not to have any nasty surprises in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism come Monday.	4.566761313396717
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators, but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion.	5.42299080773198
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.	5.475164778724761
I ask Mr Nielson, in his summing-up, to directly address those points in the resolution.	5.071551789380248
	-0.0
We, however, second the Council' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus.	4.004526910506447
The challenge of enlargement is political.	2.241754232833947
This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world.	5.552719900976152
This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region.	5.499630241678386
Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back.	4.543193867303658
We have made our views very clear to them.	4.82196984407148
We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce.	3.083289034331044
Similarly, as concerns the field of justice and criminal law, which we have discussed today, I believe not only that the different criminal law, juridical and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated, but also that we must at last formulate common standards: an offence committed in Italy must also be viewed as an offence in Great Britain, Spain or elsewhere.	5.169667545761588
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful.	6.584852791679589
Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal.	6.126245039912964
In return for this, however, we want early notification obligations to be discontinued, rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them, and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his/her posting.	4.928393402555346
Having said this, some of our fellow Members clearly have qualms because the report by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipulating that there must be 40% female participating in research in Europe.	3.9109015645873053
It is the Member States' parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty.	4.149389401203714
Five months are provided for this.	3.7918763265148345
The convention, as you will be aware, also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur.	4.797218745506115
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore.	5.030280659536101
But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo.	5.417798033333211
I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales.	5.395644739571437
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.	4.901807299082674
It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually.	4.311149196471898
The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon, and will include seminars on legal issues and on women' s rights, and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part.	5.011206724750592
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier, who described the state of the world in terms of the economy' s reign of terror.	5.126942296139978
It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal, rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs, which are no longer solely connected with agriculture, in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also, for instance, in rural tourism, sport and cultural activities, environmental projects, SMEs, services, and so on.	3.9245765011128277
Of course, the final trade-offs will be made, as in any institutional negotiations, and I think this is no bad thing, at Council level, especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government, who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands.	4.0261618592646045
The question of renationalisation: first of all, although it is not really necessary, I would like to point out and stress, several times if I may, that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that, as far as Regulation 17 is concerned, there is a risk of renationalisation.	3.9110087886736435
This is an irreparable loss.	3.6308462644787416
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional, renewable energy sources?	4.297933379977447
As the rapporteur said, this becomes particularly important when tourism is appreciated as a unitary productive system because of its ability to absorb large quantities of agricultural and industrial products, services and transport and to create a significant amount of added value.	5.308352917533137
There is a substitute, which is used to vaccinate chickens.	4.231914207452381
The whole of the Union must have the same protection, a type of protection which prohibits counterfeiting, not only of currencies in circulation but also of currencies which will be in circulation.	4.984011406696689
So, in the first part on the new forms of European governance, the words 'federalism' and 'superstate' are not mentioned at all.	4.397665231701601
But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council.	4.786213300319454
In the area of environment, we are looking at ways to cooperate with Mrs WallstrÃ¶m; in the area of regional policy Mr Barnier is giving a lot of attention to this sector.	4.399667576912622
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.	5.494578749212667
Both biological and economic information are included.	3.9574694323716213
Mr President, today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities.	3.462613267635682
But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied.	5.017002059785787
We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management.	3.9992573197899355
Too late, too selective and too fragmented: this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community.	4.58513370092086
I am more than happy to include Bulgaria and Romania in this, as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former Yugoslavia, plus Albania.	4.02604150883211
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen, strengthening and intensifying it.	5.590747073778167
For some time, we have all agreed on this notion, but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement, even if this comes at a price.	3.695449291758506
He has fewer than 2 000 officers, and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000.	3.7340143338794385
Consumers see their standard of living being eroded, poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition, in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business.	5.271160328527601
It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door.	5.043484640751887
We have experienced this in our own national and European history. People can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant.	5.540655094897793
With liberalisation, how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own, Greece, with its particular geographical features and its numerous, small but inhabited islands?	4.4671124683668575
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell' Alba' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of. Take a look at Jean Monet' s memoirs.	5.916347141193894
The OHIM is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by June.	4.959078395408447
We shall now support your Amendment No 6, but I wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee.	4.830178359656473
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July.	5.5346761073585276
This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union' s common foreign and security policy.	2.887426844975488
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start. I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly.	5.0429713522016595
We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability, of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain, is part of that confidence-building mechanism.	5.444665481898795
However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment.	4.961092700548218
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware.	5.446610597075975
Report (A5-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta (COM(1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS))	1.215833167552058
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics?	3.794803113225024
The first is that economic policy, employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional.	3.4859901746439435
The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important, such as peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution, food security, fisheries and immigration.	4.100139000589629
Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, in the different political and security committees or in the military committee?	4.776520983883774
Financial control' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate.	5.292952381090628
It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term.	4.515721257485131
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years.	4.368066833946785
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	3.034823678465231
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission, we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them.	3.897752372380283
After the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Leader of the Palestinian Authority, the Israeli Prime Minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 February, the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.	3.7284595419672972
Thank you for the presentation.	1.44466984003514
We shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the Commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the States which consider this service essential to the citizen.	4.355459959862467
Secondly, to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7% of GDP to defence expenditure?	4.991217233642427
I want to emphasise, however, that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission, it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission.	4.770747296272488
That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role.	4.9048998763030145
My group will not be supporting those amendments.	3.375837873956079
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.19724361259626147
He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas.	3.8689992615205884
Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done.	4.193503898368041
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, after his few hours working in this Chamber with these Members of the European Parliament, whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay?	3.793440363213538
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme.	4.016853338834237
This proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases!	2.5471089532050106
Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions.	5.402599874307189
In addition to making up the majority of the population, women are also the most dynamic element in society: it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men, and in many of our regions, they are the main feature of the innovation, training, performance and flexibility development model.	4.756975553495689
This is the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis.	2.4322765257123633
Thank you very much Commissioner.	1.3632972428066734
On the one hand, it continued to refuse to accept the term "European cultural policy" or other similar terms, even undervaluing the terms of the Treaty, and it defines "Culture 2000" simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more.	4.209643118123897
The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council.	3.7433968609139314
We want instruments to prevent abuse.	4.556257340213198
Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered.	6.356066667527334
Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text.	5.8649732498951845
Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt.	3.2658653942626943
I hope that Europe, in terms of social protection, will make a step forward, taking into account subsidiarity, for without subsidiarity, this would not be possible.	3.3507989826046756
Social growth has occurred only in those areas where the tourist market has given rise to the development of all the activities required to meet the needs of visiting tourists, thus creating an entire productive system.	4.64756255678083
So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country.	3.7401681586807944
Can anyone argue with any persuasiveness that women are treated equally and fairly, that children have human rights or that people are not discriminated against because of their religion, belief, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, opinion, political affiliation etc?	5.693292263382927
Mr President, Commissioner, Mozambique is a young African country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy.	4.909971211071742
- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today, but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do.	3.3420571450888694
Secondly, what does it propose to do about them?	4.682014587153739
For our part, we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes.	3.4269048929216264
I welcome any questions, suggestions or proposals from the Members present.	5.56128247674876
Thank you for your attention.	1.545161779529104
It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation.	5.505636306765236
Danube environmental disaster	-0.0
It is the service which remains closest to the citizens and which we call a 'public service' , which makes it possible for everyone resident within European territory to receive the service, and this entitlement must remain an acquired right, an acquis communautaire.	5.370226220080534
Indeed, we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many.	5.0334193792631226
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations.	3.4055227861581256
We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end.	5.396617392301311
No, there must be no undermining of OLAF' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur' s intention.	4.347854431676736
The Council once again reiterated the need, in its December conclusions, to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and, in particular, to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented.	3.9227253018039105
The debate is closed.	0.026223728884438406
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea.	6.577180084397396
The path which the Commission is walking is, in fact, obvious.	3.7726620476346793
Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO.	4.17601444123228
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion.	2.612443815171262
Are there any comments?	0.1318562315173694
In area after area, we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States.	4.098470660333659
This is not the Union' s only contribution.	3.158971121546156
What has become of it?	3.744444827354093
Finally, I would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency' s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union' s policies, and in particular in the context of its foreign policy.	2.6025073330770585
I do not think that I can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted.	4.163888716241755
At present dear colleagues, we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea, nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system.	4.745357047999975
Mr President, allow me to start with the conquest of Kosovo.	2.6667463715066666
What I can say is that I hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible.	3.1528778092311733
What is more, if we reduce manufacturers' liability on this issue, this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas, for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computers and other electronic equipment.	4.466051160981704
A flourishing tourist sector can be totally wiped out by an ecological disaster such as an oil slick.	3.929618672196468
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay, conditions, staff representation rights and so on, but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters.	6.080576937728236
But we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure.	4.945192027472603
This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc.	5.394426505958883
Yet words spoken, written or signed are not in themselves enough.	5.7050987955954175
On behalf of my group, but also personally, I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens' rights and guarantees, which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States.	4.379283566719149
If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level, this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action, including Community actions, on energy saving.	4.435875331356518
That is what this framework decision is about.	3.54848333720138
Thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously.	5.272414832264965
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.	5.330206085870152
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel.	5.365818214836914
EQUAL stands for "equality" .	4.296955912955722
I just mention that to complete the view of the process.	3.6053877406133883
Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration.	3.1645630524625967
Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.	5.4478845794105935
Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission.	3.0938622091969203
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, however worthy the cause.	4.859745830012412
I will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which I regard as the essential issue in today' s debate.	3.9323782102405795
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.	4.021565324596816
European competition policy, as we very often forget, is not just important for fair competition as such, but also for prices, growth and employment, and hence for the public.	4.2220163022897985
Moreover, we are asking the Russian authorities to provide immediate clarification of conditions in the so-called detention centres, and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention, maltreatment or killing of civilians are laying themselves open to accusations of crimes against humanity.	5.622810800985822
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.	3.7014281388876213
This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March.	3.2155069629584547
I am quite sure that Mrs Kinnock' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations.	4.622149418739765
Reread the letter: The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat, Article 6 of the Treaty.	3.5132394424513453
Over recent years, these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed.	6.176603728236097
It is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme, because there remains a shortcoming in the report.	5.228539969389475
It is Europe's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster.	4.772548675441249
Otherwise, there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands. It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained, and the idea was, in fact, that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained.	4.898111128303425
The Commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion, to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union' s regional policy.	3.5330368516373496
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship, many people were perpetrators too, although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt.	5.339640355420994
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative, opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area, even though it is true that more could have been expected, particularly with regard to access to the various strands.	3.7440610686770723
Is it the product of mere foolishness or, more probably, of a deliberate strategy, which is the same throughout the world?	4.6081190755505625
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	4.803738708575127
I would remind you of the fact that the Belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know-how and expertise from disappearing from the company.	5.494836030707453
Parliament' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy.	4.392375049183098
I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject.	4.777373045996069
We have no specific, concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency.	5.301510039037005
Mr Prodi reverts to the contested concept of 'governance' ; contested because it favours state intervention over a proper working democracy and refers to the notion as defined by the IMF, whose ideological agenda is predicated solely on liberalism and monetarism.	6.682201572469544
This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure.	4.479550911995363
I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes.	3.7741772874519426
It is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the Commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole.	5.93086382886438
In Italy, we have begun to withdraw and recycle around 80% of old cars, but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in Italy industry often resorts to lay-offs and redundancies - and cause problems for workers in different parts of Italy.	5.674289028677291
But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation.	5.663912807800045
The Commission is fully aware of the fact that the draft we have before us is not perfect or ideal.	3.872220285473878
But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued.	5.512300724600903
We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred.	5.009461574345603
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement, as did the President this afternoon, to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday.	4.6754817273969165
So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets.	3.7150709114491414
- (EL) The Freedom Party' s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union' s political future.	2.9321191347206055
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports.	5.047267484892413
We believe we have respected that commitment, and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the Commission.	4.81936707372598
Mr President, a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes.	4.115770437495831
Europe is a community of law.	2.5694030492668287
In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission, we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close.	4.005526062611677
The European Union should be taking a more decisive role that goes further than merely providing financial support, although that is important, by promoting and guaranteeing reconciliation between the two communities through the setting up of fora and confidence-building programmes.	5.278320387340303
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER, with the participants on the ground, with the local organisations on the ground, with many non-governmental organisations, with the churches, with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities.	4.70244552813135
There is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle, codecision procedure, and Conciliation Committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen, and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European consciousness.	4.569705026109878
The report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects.	5.01885331333301
Madam President, the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials.	4.5857243614674115
Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred, all of which will boost the ACP countries' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy.	5.6417728115283765
What could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for?	4.472195700660025
Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy' s turn.	3.368865042193889
It is nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other, even more delicate issues into account: the whole issue of double jeopardy, that of specialities, and that of the credibility of one Member State of the Union in respect of the judicial authorities of other Member States of the Union.	4.516902218147489
The EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria, which would be binding and of real effect.	5.384279571943824
I look forward to Parliament' s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward.	3.8686923757855523
They want answers.	1.8632818647289713
However, in the case of Sweden, the situation is different.	1.9182055197270604
Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration.	4.546417675323267
Children have lost parents, families are bereft, hopeless, helpless and they have lost absolutely everything.	6.341663640494357
Now is the time to devote our time and energy to aiding Cypriots from both sides of the "green line" in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long.	4.881454807502185
However, the Commission will be suspending its position, given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments.	5.165300308903229
Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach, but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community.	4.906211808204116
The polluter should pay.	0.6866167534121769
Honourable Members, Commissioner, it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector, but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector.	4.083153108017036
I think that, under the present rules of the Treaties, the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation.	3.571509748200417
On the other hand, the Turkish Cypriots fear - and there is no point in trying to conceal this - that Turkey' s application for membership of the European Union may lead to greater flexibility in Ankara' s position on this.	3.831923828068641
On the other hand, we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find (a) materials that are easier to recycle and (b) to set up recycling industries.	4.196735595493285
The debates on UCITS gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee.	5.0710667608579385
The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December, without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon.	5.637691088927184
And, finally, the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarified. Regarding this, too, there has been only silence by way of a response from the Commission.	4.205482786590487
With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency, budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness.	4.554410026018633
As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96/71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force, no change is necessary.	4.343128742634291
Encouraging Turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the UN Secretary General.	4.68863435836072
I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that, in many cases, we will say this together.	5.439308689530337
This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own.	3.6436124900705513
As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change.	4.469862282933878
The risk of counterfeiting increases. Counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire EU; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State.	5.56993738230578
These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes.	3.9436716759155632
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Gallagher' s report on the fourth amendment of the Regulation on technical measures was not amended in our committee. It was actually approved unanimously for which I congratulate the rapporteur.	3.9645740833025966
The creation of this taxation, of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by Professor LaurÃ©, could prove to be politically opportune, at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate. This is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of States.	6.0972566587758354
I refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that is bending the truth.	4.575904689597893
A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States.	3.7988490700734134
But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies.	5.144647762829282
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts.	3.728000099814411
Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here.	5.774421354668109
When Mr Dalmau, the Cuban Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Assembly, he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known.	5.957260445906746
Then we shall follow the usual procedure, hearing one speaker in favour and one against.	3.2260000676563476
Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are connected to our development policies, our economic policies, our home affairs policies, indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions.	4.076673939005949
It is high time there was peace in the Middle East.	3.0026417770464087
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term.	4.650171953772188
My third point has also been mentioned already.	2.8540917982464156
EQUAL remains crucial also to regions like my own, in the east of England, outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response.	5.3937129270078845
.	-0.0
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century.	4.176757782559454
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?	5.410685493636094
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we need this directive.	2.349589418510669
These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause, even in extremely minimal quantities, changes in the gender of animals and even humans, as is more and more being ascertained by scientists.	6.061660146925587
For example, in my own region, in Manchester, the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success.	4.019042646602357
As far as your question is concerned, this problem does not only apply to Denmark. It is not only Denmark which has matters pending.	4.978568627120086
The big question, however, is from what budget heading should this aid be financed?	5.399625948127625
Mr President, Commissioner, I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that, as far as the Council is concerned, the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE.	4.465151704762781
Thirdly, we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in Europe, but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital.	5.1300261076097
Parallel to this European strategy of social convergence, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required, together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees, accompanied by a concrete timetable.	3.813259810468814
However, agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues, and the representative of the northern part of the island, Rauf Denktash, has suggested three new topics: sovereignty, confidence-building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island.	3.9229787990500387
I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain.	5.536630703745749
Mr President, Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has knocked everything off balance.	3.246218544512479
We should not overlook the fact that, although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery, they are by no means the only point.	4.287587390231153
We have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that JÃ¶rg Haider stands for.	3.988480242855297
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women.	4.444268927777324
I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated, namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions, the consumption of alcohol will remain the same.	5.445825480892325
We could, in no way, agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package.	4.190114627528469
As you know, in our country, each village has its own local post office or at least a post box, with a collection every day.	4.6269915627481994
Thirdly, we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports, that is in every port of the European Union.	4.407435244691087
Firstly, the governments made a commitment at the Maastricht Conference of 1992 to include a legal basis for this issue in the Treaties. This commitment was not fulfilled in the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 and is therefore outstanding.	5.614164679873259
It means that in Fleetwood, 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April.	5.4511519352233755
- (PT) Mrs McKenna, a large part of the problem you have raised relates to issues which are the responsibility of the Commission.	3.4719555459292897
Any analysis of economic development in recent years, if objective, will show, through the figures, that they have no political colour or orientation.	4.311363237633313
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product.	5.404405521740183
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred.	4.535487295423697
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER+ programme because of its comprehensive nature.	3.841106488937068
In addition, you should know that, on 4 June 1998, the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs, the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe.	4.909868118135705
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact.	3.9818874417519727
As forcefully underlined by this report, labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock.	5.932403314186529
Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy.	5.973268217192254
What are the Council's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	2.21582870743239
In rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost-effective, I believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent tendering conditions, so that all the market forces, and of course the existing postal services too, can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies.	5.067480975745703
Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence.	3.4334025121232368
Even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks, we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective.	5.625455581817032
McNally Report (A5-0082/1999)	3.9831280622442025
Indeed, they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided.	5.218715726281987
Amendment No 12 responds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of this House.	2.2111852756238064
If we develop motive power of the kind I have described, I am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload.	5.1579921758870695
.	-0.0
We have never before seen such serious, clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	4.057032377460053
But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process.	4.773974129600911
My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this.	2.807949386160268
However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic.	4.992243894427344
The fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom, which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced.	6.275297006462263
(Parliament rejected the request, with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions)	4.571505846066729
I know that this is an extremely delicate issue, but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented.	4.478179511883239
I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position, in my view, with precision, clarity and commendable brevity.	4.3429607001256185
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question.	3.9917939442025445
The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace, security and stability.	3.9501625799709483
However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about.	5.055841706757249
If the Alliance is still active in that region, it is with the same objective.	3.5391184303758205
Michelin caused a great stir.	3.5461199948935938
We need to provide alternative answers, otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe' s positive roles in history.	6.192686488657665
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis.	3.297421658495314
These feeder funds exist in the United States, which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system.	4.772479686105507
It should be acknowledged, however, that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members.	4.490166994178317
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda.	3.809912905517901
There is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy.	3.7880832592801976
The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process.	2.3350439483906826
Secondly, we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation.	4.272956834822415
As regards rural development, which a number of you brought up, particularly Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur: a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas, but also protection of the environment and Europe' s rural heritage.	4.801757267182532
Mr President, it has already been said that, after a war which engulfed the country in misery, Mozambique is now facing a natural disaster of terrifying proportions.	4.959968447602512
Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion.	4.075554257980496
In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.	5.295147465250663
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented, farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly, which resulted in their depopulation.	4.649117155032393
As far as I am concerned, at least, the principle of 'polluter pays' must be applied.	2.0264149768086397
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union, from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy; even to the response by the 14, the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria.	3.6977355902442506
I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role, that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process.	4.309398078178538
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.	1.043570039806471
Saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate.	4.584561849592743
On the other hand, for the sake of simplifying procedures some highly debatable amendments have been included in the Berger report, one example of which is the establishment of a common information service for cards issued by a body in any Member State.	4.830680205132362
Scientific studies are now no more than a formality: water will be the main resource at stake in years to come, starting tomorrow.	4.460396286787335
As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage, I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament.	4.22393559308848
We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-minority.	5.916761479016427

In fact, it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission.	3.728723689099139
As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.	4.9374022097466215
What is the Commission' s verdict on this?	2.572270008145035
It is a report which tries to give direction.	3.0873859634407705
We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic, pluralist society in these countries with institutions, public structures, police forces and a structured civil society, but, above all, we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region, as regards both politics and the economy.	5.1381142369262855
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions.	4.238068106782954
Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced, as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control, and which pollute the water quite substantially.	5.4267794602371815
High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force.	4.584801953443369
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources, as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases.	4.85818637322715

The cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace, although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible.	5.633926771271503

My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East, even though, as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki.	5.610690206519937
The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature, which is nowadays too often being punished by man' s activities.	5.826202379530241

As in employment strategy, there are four thematic areas: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament' s proposals.	3.3448857703888066
We have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater.	4.607087100664738
I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport.	3.493783740831439
So, Mr President, I will walk away from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament' s intellectual and political support, which appears to come from all sides of the House, for competition policy, its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future.	3.639007784402957
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it is for this chain to provide us with safe, healthy food which is produced, as a matter of principle, without any questionable or risky interim or end products.	3.879294912743483
All in all, though, I deem this report to be worthwhile.	3.3479800638432233
Women are systematically raped.	2.7233256079314683
The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative, even if it does so timidly, on this subject. However, I agree with the previous speaker that, if paragraph 9 were challenged, this motion would clearly lose its substance.	5.5545627308272545

I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat, when they met on Monday.	6.03414716424686

The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.	1.5660040586652177
Mr President, the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe.	1.9437825129333974
That is what I would have preferred, personally.	3.688039560293951
Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.	4.90707508695306

It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped.	4.432942599781773
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States.	3.4404246714663764

At a more central level, there is a need for more effective co-ordination between government donors, international NGOs, indigenous NGOs and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted.	5.391917750189267
If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future.	3.935463596244049

Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson.	6.208764935486491
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan.	2.5331170983442695

These offences must be punishable even if they relate to banknotes and coins denominated in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 January 2002.	6.112971204697739
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock.	4.124155019034755
The ingredients of this policy are well known. They are the stimulation of public and private investment, increased investment in research, education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise.	3.370278011722561
Consequently, I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003, and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003.	4.72871778149536
I welcome Parliament's support for that.	3.697951962067525
And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this.	4.191099422462378
I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices, eternal vigilance, not just outside our borders but within.	5.733018419416189
We assent to the main thrust of it, but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage.	4.628080969143696
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006, but that is another subject.	3.5223147001166804
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea.	6.195030590753045
It is, above all, the manufacturer' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car' s life-cycle.	3.383551933749672
It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good.	4.259680627019519
Madam President, I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Graa Moura, and Commissioner Reding, for their contribution to the creation of this programme.	2.9144280304685815
That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call.	6.022533333272352

At the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic.	5.2411052575188
It is clear that in a process such as this, where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe, there is an on-going dialogue between the different parties concerned.	4.351577659621322
Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling?	5.49586846336317
Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse.	5.270463371605326

As far as Cyprus is concerned, although the Council stated that a political settlement would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. It also stated that its decision on accession would be made without the above being a precondition, which I welcome.	3.949562166917673
Our objective, the committee' s objective, the Court of Auditors' objective is not to abolish financial control, it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control.	4.249734002926422
Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled.	3.1616232679784035
This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States.	4.653068484013737
The eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature.	3.9346229254774405
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, to thank the speakers and, of course, to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure, who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result.	3.3946438907889327

Subject: New premises for the OHIM At present the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) is still operating from the same temporary premises, even though its new building was opened in June 1999.	5.865418755529067
We are discussing last year' s discharge, but also the Commission' s responsibility.	3.2152555160193974
Hitherto this has been out of the question of course.	2.597681585053507
I wonder, since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber, whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government.	5.309866152433274
That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	4.660926090451489
We Socialists reject the liberals' naÃ¯ve optimism on this point.	4.98398967446713
Therefore, once more, we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision. Codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type, which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application.	5.515858360374683
She ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council, who is not exactly a stranger to you, how this presumed lack of coherence has come about.	4.014071947323999
The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution.	3.6505424408508227
Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission.	3.6843109752466185
A Communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity.	5.5379823537503965
The directive remains in place.	4.642949777113071
I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens, both in personal as well as in social and economic terms, but a right which it is our job to assert, and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union.	4.747216858567306
For the sake of our credibility, we will have to speak with one voice when it comes to human rights and not act as if human rights within the EU are different from human rights elsewhere in the world.	3.3962245673123785
Mr President, I welcome much, indeed most, of what has been said in this debate.	3.5172777561155417
And, in conclusion, Mr President, let me also insist upon the fact that, in addition to the measures proposed, there are also legislative measures and, most especially, adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives.	3.8249709431729983
Parliament must therefore give its assent, because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence.	4.898387781887659
We have made many promises in this regard, but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread.	4.657454055668943
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.	3.793958716489578
Moreover, regarding these small businesses, we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in, the yellow card, instead of an immediate red card, which will be a large fine and will threaten the company' s very existence.	4.7143113614933165
The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes.	3.1044852045246127

Globalisation, free trade, and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy, were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue.	4.582488489365962
Turning to our development policy, I would say that the global context has changed drastically.	3.7499193089227347
Unlike a number of Member States, the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far.	4.204640442080791
The common position is not ambitious enough.	1.4478806504191306
Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns.	3.8901989153735563
And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account.	3.084472280697384
Today, even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for.	5.163623883663762
This is a real political objective, alongside economic and monetary affairs, drawn up in collaboration with Member States, regions and local communities, with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming.	3.956068396358739
Since 4 July 1990, when Cyprus applied to join the EU, the European Parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.	3.9852770493948095
I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted.	5.4298786706693285
The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today, is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy.	2.863794835538929
Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone.	5.765317327713372
I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions, not just between Commission and Parliament, but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge.	4.26928337271404
I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing.	4.16823359809777
I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.	4.664268294476191

The next item is the report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD)).	0.9883921970187155

However, there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime. A year ago, we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up.	5.536661468287293
To achieve this I was ready and I am ready to make certain sacrifices, but not just anything! Most especially, I am no longer ready to accept the formation of a liberal single market if Europe is not at the same time capable of defending the values on which it is based and which, in the 1960s, made me a committed European!	5.228043808504882

Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I should like to start with a quote: "The Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme.	2.6819860700657943
This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second.	4.562240514749347

One reason why I am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that I do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality, the response is 'Oh but we know you are not running things efficiently, we know that you have not spent all your commitments, we know there is some money in your back pocket' .	5.564938634971138
Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area?	5.257918658759098
The first is that this matter is sub judice in several European countries, and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system.	3.711638643827655
We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee.	3.2659129383682313
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union.	2.2179307641918626
In that respect, nothing. On the contrary, extending the Community' s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden.	4.039521525874439
You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different.	4.273573042366932
Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America.	4.926683557928141
As a supplementary question, I should like to ask you whether, as the Portuguese Presidency, you have made provision for the rights of children, as such, to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the Charter.	3.059077395721814
Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting.	4.887153553374775

(FR) Mr President, before my friends and fellow Commissioners, Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou, in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest, I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG, which many of you have brought up and discussed.	4.140437427966727
What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers.	4.6344036802762885
Free enterprise, free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the European Union.	4.09609478611133
Clear guidelines and indicators are required. At the same time, the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans.	5.014662420015334
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 .	2.7557797948948233
For 150 years, the postal services have been a public affair and, as such, just like public transport and the power supply, a core task of the national governments.	5.014880657069412
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation.	3.4159817249458198
In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too.	5.395805318680226
As far as I know, that has still not happened.	2.850832492081395
Only then can we follow in the footsteps of the founders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.	5.355238408402302
Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women' s rights, I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, to today' s debate.	5.267041589005971
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way.	5.772735354365439
There are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting, this being a measure which we would encourage.	4.760606179522331
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe.	5.752595200178515
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berend' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.	4.748022116976701
Despite this, he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the War Crimes Tribunal against NATO after applications by Canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question.	5.601895188961532
It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up, one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone.	4.917385123218796
To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29, to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension, would be going too far, and these cannot be approved.	4.807006459149087
The human rights policy is also too selective.	3.094609884823485
Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application.	2.784208263203024
I would like to make two observations during this intervention, which stem from the report itself, given this Parliament' s obligation, in accordance with the Treaty, to produce a very succinct report, which does not go into depth.	3.7648195189709748
While the report was being prepared, it was interesting to discuss the Union' s regional policy in general.	3.25105342302145
From this point of view we are slightly behind the times.	4.192933664864504
Question No 47 by (H-0088/00):	4.057358449423764
I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects, indebtedness, assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety, humanitarian, educational and health-related issues, and also fields such as the environment, investment and access to information and new technologies. This also applies to the sphere of trade, where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies, and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States.	4.820846785344095
We need this at European level and internationally; we need something like a TÃV, an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany, which is compulsory every two years.	5.891910827719332
This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate, by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers.	4.865072168244378
No single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes, ranging from macro-economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting themes such as gender, environment, good governance and institutional reforms.	4.72177814390637
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget.	3.010633604282119
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99):	2.4045943830155565
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives, but Parliament' s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained.	4.917336825155019
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed.	5.6814163680281045
We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001.	3.976777248967587
However, we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements.	4.296058086045206
You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation.	4.715312263577396
The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive.	1.745688021665935
For example, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler spoke in English about 'long-term capital for long-term projects' - this is an obvious issue.	5.456878618411329
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times.	4.6487538972180955
Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission' s offices for several months.	4.404799307231617
The Union is simply doing its job when it seeks through its cooperation policy to encourage nations to espouse a platform of common values with it, of which democracy and civil liberty are the cornerstone.	6.6785922985431325
In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.	5.750540414675276
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.	5.137340657997384
In Europe, in your rapporteur' s opinion, this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years, not just once but repeatedly.	4.798629730107294
I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union.	3.4824909778599586
I repeat, a "serious and persistent breach" is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State.	3.5068995284929825
Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union.	3.1473389172046504
SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.	5.177645693546782
Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits.	4.944579488085252
Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on European postal services with all the more satisfaction since it reiterates once again the position I have always defended in this House, which is the need for a high quality universal service, particularly ensuring this service in the least populated regions and rural regions, and there are some even in my small country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.	4.621811645393414
Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work.	3.859294159773199
We can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers.	4.900909864488973
Mr President, the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission, to whom it was to be granted, had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity.	5.117199965834575
After nearly 10 years, Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name, and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia.	5.774628762223814
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the Bureau and to the appropriate committees.	6.127659682815583
But I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament, in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised.	3.1547225721978824
Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding.	3.0556466047239397
It is good that this directive should be established now, as, otherwise, Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time, a period of transition, which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy.	4.645595690509038
(Applause)	-0.0
You say that you are against war, but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that.	3.4929302753082796
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say.	3.381943077097961
Mr President, I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate, not just because development is in general an important issue, but because it is also a topical one.	4.235329845460408
In my opinion, the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe.	5.140794669084176
She would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the EU.	5.464281858856639
I shall read it in English, which is the original language of the resolution.	3.5190451001690914
It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights, work on which has just begun.	3.3964666664703254
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People's Party or does the Austrian People's Party continue to sit in that political group?	5.6568026089312795
In any case, we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action.	5.250848275823062
I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba.	4.7125170886074566
It is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions.	3.722188169136983
On south-eastern Europe, I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements.	3.584330298216448
I will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the Commission' s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other. I will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint.	5.0582928770304845
The next item is the report A5-0036/2000 by Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93/53/EEC introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases (COM(1999) - C5-0168/1999 - 1999/0191 (CNS)).	3.0899079566476124
What are the Council's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	1.8408190760086884
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place, but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation, would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.	4.001482459337417
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.	3.423255562963629
The newcomers are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices.	6.214163893907926
Above all, we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice, hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations, in other words, its resources.	2.8698614532907367
In this sense, the USA is not only our partner; it is also our competitor; not our opponent, our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model.	6.105604444481349
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.	3.8875694173483937
I can only warn you against consenting to this.	5.652075741224793
Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals.	3.3916281839287343
We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement.	5.068583496195707
Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us.	3.5288038039729233
It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet.	4.577555037705357
The account of the Dineh Indians is telling.	2.932249286991997
We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member.	1.6036504412151593
Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks?	2.2040680666697168
For example, I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component, namely refugees.	4.107157061055194
This is a positive development in itself, especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue.	4.730541220050894
There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion.	2.732416243150177
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available.	4.862076073704244
However, in this context, Madam President, to allow us to work out the details, I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday.	3.76576324877158
What is needed from the European Commission, the Council and everyone else, is a quiet determination, a quiet determination to continue the accession negotiations on both Cyprus and Malta without guile, granted that in the last analysis they are the most mature of all the countries seeking accession, so that this determination can act as a signal to anyone whose view may differ from the view we all agree about.	5.327702867471703
As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%).	4.142934989121104
We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history, in particular World War II, but also its policies on enlargement, on immigration, on race and its attitude to the European Union itself.	5.447926193416238
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune.	4.639261628696846
That, as you have said yourself today, means that you must also identify tasks, policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission's main vocation.	5.066130352181457
Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe' s culture, but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can.	4.520403191437065
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend Â£125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector.	4.9211361445279245
We already have an infrastructure.	2.4603723401352187
A country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself.	5.855194578960117
They are trading this in for a head of government' s position and for membership of a government.	4.907237746068566
Such a European strategy will be achieved through building on the commitment by Member States and the Commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas: exchange and dissemination of information, notably through new technologies; training in order to upgrade skills, quality of tourist products and sustainable development in tourism.	4.1000862210052835
Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy.	4.4051186806126745
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.	3.173966377081546
I must say that I support these reduced deadlines, especially as provision is made for derogations.	4.120270677711439
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the Commission' s own initiative.	3.7340420958197265
Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation.	5.557469544961667
The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems, just as it does in the foodstuffs industry.	5.187450335022257
I want to see civil society given a louder voice.	4.4537767059393465
I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission's position on the report.	2.233481407989539
. (DA) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the Joint Assembly for its work in 1999.	2.323317226803609
Here in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned, your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.	4.2561434554317366
My group's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster, just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions.	5.551591569439695
This procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group, and the matter will only be submitted to the Council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter.	4.020227244927376
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to.	3.7175673264969284
It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and, as such, a condition for political legitimacy.	3.8924379888002596
Madam President, I thought I had three minutes.	2.643028348995514
The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept.	5.882057884364911
I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union' s role in international development policies is significant.	3.0824749272587915
Mr President, Commissioner, we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading.	3.4824578098424923
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state.	5.281705527932349
The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year.	4.5123245199684305
The European Union' s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China, but an EU vote against the no-action motion.	5.196172253675911
Mr Solana has confirmed our view that, in a militarised European Union, NATO will have the upper hand.	5.237114275620033
Freedom, security and justice are the root system of any society, reflecting its history, corporate experience and political development.	5.179708023880143
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets.	5.497536859660837
We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War.	4.672064742090827
We cannot agree to this, since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States.	4.470805684887038
Our group will, at any rate, do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including, for example, the way in which the costs are to be distributed.	3.753185212859931
A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation.	4.817654876818429
The Nicosia Government has expressed its satisfaction with the Helsinki conclusions, which open up the way to accession to the European Union without solving the partition of the island beforehand.	4.683789757952911
But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself.	5.184051052389804
There is now a new Commission.	2.1513009044079756
Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested.	6.878513157203541
Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU ought only to have limited powers, except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union.	4.004332925350831
I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives.	4.947284452455315
Water is a prerequisite for human life.	2.020963043572979
I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months, and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting.	4.2719285150055475
This was the first pillar of my recommendation.	3.72865357190512
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid.	3.973449534503357
We all agree that we should ask that, halfway through these programmes, when the assessment of the directives is made, Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens' representatives.	4.069671361678398
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment, ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening.	3.7248365581238505
In this regard, too, I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate.	2.8751121100432093
At Tampere the Heads of State and Government also emphasised the importance of approximating national legislation on conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals based on a shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments in the Member States as well as the situation in the countries of origin.	3.794460040068347
However, it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.	4.951326061423321
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin.	5.815388803223537
In this respect, it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional.	2.4842305474252906
We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime.	3.8149136901276646
The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere;	4.323903766973316
It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States.	5.07707051132396
If we look at the private sector, however, we will find not only that this fabled 'financial stability' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.	5.152338676817841
These numbers represent, in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council, a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80% laid down in Council Regulation 685/95.	3.2420422954969093
It is also true, however, that, since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements, 39% of the territory of the West Bank has been handed over to the Palestinian National Authority, together with two thirds of the Gaza Strip and, more importantly, this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with, since, under the terms laid down in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Israeli Government has the right to delay that handover.	3.9073150410475033
