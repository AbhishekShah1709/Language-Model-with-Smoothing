I believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in Amendment No 4.	5.44876563828331
For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.	4.822440961023942
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	0.20658432690317088
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out.	3.9067576864506957
We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters.	7.59110676625365
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio.	6.341615390313673
What are the scenarios for development and the potential risks?	4.324137711594504
A programme such as INTERREG is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders, projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale.	6.366470480572104
The Council has behaved in an unseemly manner, changing tack in mid-course, and is nowhere to be seen.	6.0338181148337044
I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage.	4.242206531907313
Seven, to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency: for example, in reforestation following storm damage, or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick, etc.	4.189809493279592
The previous speaker already said something about this.	5.788363792736598
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons?	4.918291703874189
Neither outcome would be satisfactory.	5.012376017306122
How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters?	6.5046835361699955
And to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient?	7.560663002639462
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	0.28457076873952797
Thirdly, one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground.	6.881165750284713
Madam President, my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today, particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about.	5.831148451640938
The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy.	4.923301443618245
Mr President, I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today.	5.610463330901917
These should indeed be excluded from the directive. Secondly, the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars.	5.670678049957258
Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights.	8.413357472450752
Secondly, in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years, we consider that the main question to be considered by the Commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the EU which neither the programme nor the motion mention.	5.073281323238792
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions.	6.501068048181136
My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed, especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens, as the Commissioner has explained very well.	3.837463086050513
When we have the chance to ask direct questions, the questions which Mr BÃ¶ge referred to will be asked.	5.833445090181488
It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected.	6.062420920380148
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.	7.874599980457394
I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead.	4.796585451947368
Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard.	7.120309697685592
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report.	2.6060275102468218
It marks the beginning, rather than the end, of a process.	2.7456938994505746
The transfer of water is already covered by controls, but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer.	6.238004474229434
As far as Cyprus is concerned, part of the technical and financial aid provided for in the instruments will be used to bring the Greek and Turkish communities closer together and solve the problem of the partition of the island once and for all.	4.445890755124685
There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development.	5.542558965885924
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed, you will be doing us a great service.	5.27346350131109
The outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions, to the extent that we are providing you with options.	5.155194338512387
I am waiting for the Commission' s report on the ultra-peripheral regions, which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999.	4.674956644713297
. The European Union is currently in the process of adopting new EU water legislation to update and to establish a long-term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters.	5.661874813661281
This well-known phrase, which is taken from the conclusions of the UN World Conference on human rights of 1993, is known off by heart by many.	6.482036443696444
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	0.45288027642967243
The recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe, on the contrary.	4.618214341305334
I now come to the EQUAL initiative, which is, of course, based on Article 13.	1.3757313412368688
This is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency.	4.709346344697017
Secondly, Cuba.	0.8973464231255763
I wish insistently to remind the Council and, should it be necessary, Parliament, that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing.	4.687802092535604
We understand the context of this essential debate.	5.405499746306112
That is important, for at least three reasons.	2.970224764237823
But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe.	5.678273674955489
I sincerely hope that, in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East, all the key protagonists will move forward quickly, in the very near future, so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved.	4.263780057754188
Mr President, Commissioner, as far as restructuring goes, there is no doubt that European companies must adapt so that they are better placed to face new challenges or go under.	5.189872458283967
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed.	6.333504333548717
I do not like the term 'leftovers' any more than Richard Corbett does.	6.032273481497587
Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure.	3.0586183765638606
On the question of the indigenous peoples in the US, I am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the US authorities will have been noted by them.	5.283956065341104
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another.	6.5401738512325345
Berend Report (A5-0107/1999)	0.34916187496407386
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge, the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997.	5.690181385501464
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Council Presidency' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness.	5.810202701769774
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission.	4.738778138502569
This is why, Madam President, I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words, so that nobody, absolutely nobody, can use this message, which is unusual and unwise, to say the least, to contribute, and that includes counter to the intentions of Mr Prodi, towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in Austria a commonplace.	5.752987757930049
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, turned a deaf ear to this Parliament.	5.579977703668645
(PT) Mr President, I would like to make a few very brief comments on behalf of the Council presidency, and first to remind you that the work done by the presidency is above all about coordination and about seeking common positions on initiatives that the fifteen Member States are to approve in the Council. Our experience of previous sessions of the Human Rights Commission suggests - precisely by virtue of this coordinating role played by successive presidencies - that the European Union is very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the Commission, and it is important to maintain this.	5.1964951724089605
The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration.	4.860045670337074
There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system.	4.879039299734257
Secondly, we have to have realistic targets, but targets nevertheless.	4.297369643130707
We explicitly address corruption; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever.	5.948590463840614
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.	6.535724671588511
For this reason, we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently.	4.096691220762471
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards, we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed'.	7.482819067972494
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.	3.7705118888617792
We are making an overall value judgement about NATO' s action, and this overall value judgement is positive. We agree with the general view of NATO' s action.	5.532199926196119
In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway.	2.148580106532352
During these years, the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport.	5.37019481260203
The debate is closed.	0.03729499922396469
These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement.	5.068231429782363
For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees.	4.69297662221861
With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel, the situation could still deteriorate.	6.584954983086454
This is in place too.	3.057319285812266
What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list?	4.9490030773118825
Use of ICT opens a completely new dimension in the context of travel and tourism.	4.091089373906442
This is not the case!	1.0848367234065683
They have all been persuaded!	2.2570609011817395
For the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy, but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy, in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others, democracy and democratic life.	6.533473763490151
In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.	6.284042670996381
However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.	6.492209344247284
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.	6.151535674243716
What about women?	2.67453532693947
I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition.	5.25639438273526
I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up, but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure.	3.1904738412187386
We ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100% in the near future, which is indeed what the new Convention is aiming at.	5.673332513714799
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal?	1.6360274815025406
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States.	7.91073708538646
Non-least-developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements.	6.506675744786442
Mr President, I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which, as you are all so very well aware, led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission.	5.149042809382992
We will therefore vote for the Greens' Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position.	5.8691452452718265
Because we are aware that the developing global economic situation, and particularly the single market, can force businesses to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings, which often take the form of cross-border proceedings, the Union itself is fully justified in equipping itself with the binding legal instruments it needs to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structural principles, thus ensuring that they are carried out swiftly.	6.0752357211094195
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved.	2.444050123956594
I must not go on about books, but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues, in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies, going back millennia.	7.363164255719584
In that spirit, we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos.	4.968698163403754
How will we judge, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, the five years of our mandate?	3.091547007580569
Regardless of who is to blame - and we are not here to apportion blame, the relevant United Nations resolutions in this area are clear enough - I believe that we should take advantage of the opportunities that the new situation is opening up, in more of a rational way and less of an emotional one.	5.981390154939386
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed.	3.748842094394451
We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	6.729837466583908
It is, moreover, also accepted as an important and effective tool.	3.986487579764858
I would like to remind you of one thing: it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here.	3.64172305705433
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification.	5.109996820615547
I hope there has been an interpretation error, and that he will clarify the matter in his follow-up speech.	5.846049940585896
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments.	6.340002546247749
Moreover, an adequate contribution from different economic sectors, broken down into industrial, household and agricultural sectors, must ensure that this policy is implemented.	6.398523045427858
Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible.	4.5210083349091015
We, the Green Group, by and large support the common position.	3.476315494595894
In my Group, there are undoubtedly different views of Mr Di Pietro' s report.	3.619755404763207
Under no circumstances can we, as responsible politicians, allow what is currently happening to continue, with young girls practically bought in the countries of the East and coming here to be abused on the cheap.	6.146762057165422
Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that, in her report, she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes, which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now, to supplement and improve the text.	5.35796497939965
There is no legal basis, and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector.	3.6600694705596855
This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying, especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union' s rural development policy.	5.217098779862916
We are seeking to implement best practice.	4.153170584447742
Let us grab our chance.	4.941259521717942
But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies.	6.559616449915391
And what about vehicles which are already on the road?	3.0169550732570745
Moreover, it is important to uphold the concept that it is not possible to make a surface categorisation of entire fishing sections as more environmentally friendly: in reality, in some cases, small-scale fishing has less of an impact on the environment and natural resources.	5.179096650447054
There are many opportunities to hide.	4.905938809142357
The EU is also a union for employment and social justice.	5.329576198245756
There are still, needless to say, many unresolved problems and unanswered questions, also involving the Palestinians.	4.527260646105107
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one.	5.729670432286734
On behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have tabled an amendment to the motion for a resolution which asks the Council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible.	2.8295950748864316
In the course of the debate, many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed.	3.8748586114171073
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court.	4.068463904809261
How do you aim to eradicate homophobia, racism and sexism?	5.837348417950561
It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts.	6.935033980028325
Mrs Rothe, I would put it this way: I am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind.	4.934369078495017
He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners.	5.731770721644321
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament' s more drastic positioning.	5.049385720821204
It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme.	4.097289743253202
And I believe that it is our responsibility, in an ever more rapidly moving economy, where everyone must have a real opportunity, to give people the chance of running a commercial enterprise, and a second and a third chance, if necessary.	5.846464097040045
We shall now proceed to the vote.	0.21658866887567055
Mr President, a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service.	4.87008821926889
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	3.020136261025306
A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more.	5.715221034508403
The first consideration must be to recognise that Community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced.	6.303450651077017
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].	1.3535178501130065
The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view.	5.515420237042222
Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base, whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152.	3.977998176481196
If you do not, we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you, exactly as we did with the seed directive. I should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise, both for your legal service and ours.	5.731354666530292
They urgently need aid such as food, water and shelter in order to survive.	5.939597916105059
A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14, or even fewer?	5.565480158872396
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense.	4.910150400727858
That is true and potentially valuable, although I have to say - and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked.	5.592131970529855
Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your interventions today.	2.5240676864512177
Secondly, does he not agree that were the current government, at a national level, to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level, then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6(1) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action?	5.563528400555652
I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly, particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May.	3.7070672466312944
In this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention, which succeeds the LomÃ© Convention, is an important instrument of renewal, and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process, as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle.	5.450430002688424
It only remains to put this principle into practice.	6.321295070592825
One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union.	5.950537816585772
We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage.	4.997424953485834
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority.	6.304587717846156
My message to you is: do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content.	6.034222777897293
Mr President, esteemed gentlemen from Portugal, especially the Council representatives, you face great expectations on our part.	5.3407892820207215
In the past, this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.	5.496528775772885
With regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean, natural groundwater.	4.17294667221142
As far as specific policies are concerned, I would like to pinpoint just one on which the draft resolution focuses - regional policy.	5.559663110710434
I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland, a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue.	7.019977710827738
Commissioner Monti, the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships: postal services must be improved, not run down.	4.64945928614646
My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs.	3.2734306417803567
It is therefore important that regulation of derivatives is flexible so that the market is not tied down ahead of future developments.	6.128242923879773
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this.	5.9570471284875195
Subject: Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict?	6.242689650515626
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons.	4.477746311877424
But his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together.	6.642207381089881
Then the content: the Council draft fudges the obvious difficulty caused by widely differing legal systems, varying practices and a total lack of legal public service standards in certain Member States of the Union.	7.003794354969156
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again!	6.737699171453007
The first thing we need to do in this area is to give these stateless people the legal means to live a decent life and be able to work without being relegated to the status of pariahs, the victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple forms of administrative and police harassment, the main form of which is having to live in permanent fear of expulsion.	6.994059246143721
I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to find the information, the political will to provide genuine long-term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short-termism.	6.004254775817665
This is why I give this report my full support.	5.040241647858355
It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue.	6.789650252842568
It is about co-operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides.	7.266437795515169
The Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment.	6.7225056871393845
I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years, and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon.	4.2728499426365865
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will.	5.550512214735067
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast.	6.682132234566265
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, since I know the history of the Balkans, I should like to remind you that, for many decades, the peoples of Yugoslavia lived in peace.	3.0368659403740192
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context.	5.075878247820121
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one' s own interests.	6.345400063952409
We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which, at the same time, safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development.	4.817619931274827
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change.	6.748457149180079
When INTERREG is implemented, it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned.	5.340227619816244
The two proposals form a coherent whole.	5.59438708421548
Regarding their content, as you know, ladies and gentlemen of this House, they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but, at the same time, very passionately, as I understood her presentation just now.	5.017183330806165
For me this raises the following questions: who will work there?	4.22441096503194
This report contains 34 conclusions, including 15 calls to the Commission to adopt specific measures and actions without forgetting the environmental dimension and cultural protection, particularly in outermost and island regions.	6.3677172163695035
This adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the Member States more precisely.	5.450060238009493
Community policy in the field of water (continuation)	2.3867066894933036
This seems a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the ACP states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new LomÃ© arrangement.	6.850222134911841
All this should make it possible for us, apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them, to confirm the role of 'active frontier' of the Union.	4.7483609539076514
All we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme, one after the other.	6.336946152484632
Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.	6.2479882172220105
The best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and/or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost.	5.188487162759099
In order to ensure that at least 50% of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources, it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term.	4.192581947291088
I assume, therefore, that the EU will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total, worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance.	4.264197779303143
For this reason, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho.	1.7895016134777109
And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need.	3.90237719245141
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities.	4.461004002976661
Without any hesitation, the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs, Vladimir Rushailo, earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question.	5.892754533341566
We all have a duty to put our own house in order.	2.1240555165619734
More than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998.	6.967827824073569
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so.	4.660303228032943
In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities.	6.360216370241264
The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees, I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst.	5.35806926851941
Questions to Mr Barnier	0.7344441262109356
This is even more important given that there is no clear proof that BSE and scrapie are unrelated.	5.810988922988428
We clearly have different views, one of which is that we believe the development of the European economy can be regarded with confidence.	4.38354735762926
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today.	3.316904672149713
The lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full, and decisions must be taken speedily at Community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or berthing in our ports, to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants, and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection.	6.937904364859815
We cannot allow our European water to be polluted, Mr President, and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water, which is so precious to all of us.	5.03471624028188
This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification.	6.350156498610892
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimising the nature of the internal market.	4.839769777728077
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but, in reality, we have made little progress.	5.006774576657486
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	0.8118692503956364
In my opinion, this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control.	4.7923803260093845
The interlinking of the EU institutions, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well.	3.0740169231013668
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses.	3.4324142446067363
However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.	6.5561912885974944
Madam President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago.	3.5364730164613376
In so doing, we would not only embarrass the United States into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to UN funding, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric.	6.083674728967329
The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings, abductions, detentions, intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc.	8.097118866996462
Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that.	4.0617583270762445
You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system, as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications, in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and, above all, in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure.	5.351516881671021
You have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to.	8.205269992474046
Secondly, there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented.	5.537171468279374
The Council has already, on various occasions, stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by NATO were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions.	6.142259519287032
That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government.	6.045330778064575
Moreover, given that this opinion is quite important, we can still vote for it, and indeed, the majority of our group will be voting for it.	3.9726889991984513
To a certain extent, they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and, in any case, I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.	4.206657556071333
However, if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy, go ahead!	2.660680519385311
Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment.	1.2400845145204575
That is important.	0.4349282574970417
However, before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations, let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented.	4.748300072391084
The victim of this exchange is said to be the 35-year-old war correspondent of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Andrey Babitsky.	6.631277864859224
Mr President, we are partly to blame for this war.	3.215044499126992
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million, mainly for food, medical supplies, water and sanitation.	5.651661401185581
These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development.	5.200288734567336
We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up.	6.643298712531435
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us.	6.378832124869294
This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon, causing death.	7.267051417646248
It also reminds us of the need for a new growth model, one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the Catholics who are involved in social problems, who see, in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public, the most natural instruments for building solidarity.	5.853858441641893
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.	7.567491463803348
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals.	6.229653358175197
It is not something, I assure you, which I would wish to make a practice of.	4.029895219565699
The proposal, when it is put forward, will take account of the points of view of Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties, all of whom have been involved in an in-depth consultation process.	4.3200464914553915
It will be easier to take account of the developing countries' very diverse problems, and EU aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if, as the report makes quite clear, we take the urgently needed step of optimising our working methods, by introducing the proposed regional assemblies.	6.62130435400221
If other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project, more resources would, moreover, be required than are available in the present situation.	5.843793661391749
Mr President of the Commission, this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament, a five-year programme following the crisis of the Commission.	4.258532510918252
Furthermore, we should utilise an extraordinary budget line, since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation.	5.286152529155328
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year, which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session.	6.068116184393774
We must be sure that, in seeking allies in the area, we must not always choose anyone who offers.	4.328784783475738
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.	4.079385376359696
I consider technical support to be necessary but, given the problems with the former TAOs, no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level.	6.391123665120096
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility".	6.879079114806919
One of the EU' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market.	3.028600289165226
Two centuries later, we have achieved a great deal in Europe.	4.12686166073806
Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue, while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage.	5.961445216949645
The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union' s relations with Cambodia.	4.99189121171509
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.	2.497141387923614
I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has.	4.9295086423231576
It is precisely this which, in a sense, is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme.	5.360648169661413
An amendment was therefore made in the committee, but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form.	5.786119615721375
Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission.	5.9907097094806785
Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission.	4.747325986380984
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations, lay down clear rules, which will benefit all of us: businesspeople, investors, workers and the citizens in general.	5.6037027080280275
Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace.	5.336132546956528
Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment.	6.091356899325211
They clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email.	6.574577076793524
We are extremely concerned about moves by the Cuban Government over the last year that have further curtailed public freedom, moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty.	6.320327598004164
Mr President, Commissioner, when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation, we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly.	5.111649970393608
Other issues have been mentioned: cattle-farming in Namibia, tomatoes and milk powder in the Caribbean.	4.79388652236891
Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident, as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too.	6.763287458721658
Moreover, the European welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation.	4.589980208167288
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.	3.6169782935103054
The ship was sinking and the captain realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port.	6.901322695516275
It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition.	4.226707173952423
Last year, Parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four, and the two applicant States are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant States from Central and Eastern Europe, as they, in fact, should be, according to the declarations from the Helsinki Summit.	4.395889793157515
. Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte and congratulate him on the report.	1.6536000503975703
Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities.	6.765112010456248
First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes.	5.727989407071688
Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States' election processes?	6.056561330627487
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document.	5.2359423197820485
The debate is closed.	0.03729499922396469
That is what I should like to say by way of introduction.	3.3999991985255993
Accordingly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative, so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month. Rather, we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country, and I hope that in the process, you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months.	5.38385946171043
Secondly, looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report later this evening, paragraph 28 is of particular importance.	3.66908933197113
Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the 'Crisex 2000' exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation?	5.563629413545448
That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries.	4.960429063630895
Madam President, this morning the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years, laudable aims indeed, to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world: succeeding with enlargement, meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe, introducing better principles of governance.	5.23470401919346
I am also very sympathetic towards Amendment No 9, but I believe that it can be better formulated so as to join, at the same time, environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies.	4.582417444671971
Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what' but more 'what are we doing together' ?	6.088928481179144
In my view, instead of "weitergefÃ¼hrt werden mÃ¼ssen" the wording should be "erhalten bleiben mÃ¼ssen" .	6.058815343837224
I am therefore voting against the proposal.	2.481597706568349
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening.	4.076899710890306
As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned, I am of the opinion that the Councils' objectives lack both commitment and ambition.	5.369631506088505
Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks. This is one of the goals of your reform.	5.819756576564916
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified, as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union, meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria' s.	3.932645711240834
I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.	3.0081305068917685
Take, for example, the car manufacturing sector, where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period.	5.951099856036633
The reform is important but, if it aggravates the situation, reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the Commission, then the structure of European integration, as planned by the founding fathers for the European Commission, will be at risk.	5.146210094594836
When it comes to pollution, like sin, we are all against it, but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good.	6.880356413301521
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate.	5.320468024705672
Opinion multipliers, political groups and parties, MEPs and national MPs, elected representatives, as I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved.	5.530390460494798
The Commission should not, for example, take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to, as some have suggested, as low as 50 grammes.	5.055808015279427
Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee.	5.822409761774116
Finally, I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views.	4.326574322561789
The Commission and Parliament can help us understand, in the first place, exactly what we are dealing with, because even the term 'tourism' , as was, moreover, pointed out in the Viceconte report, is still an ambiguous term, a kind of variable that depends on latitude, climate, a range of opportunities, and a series of background factors; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production, income, wealth and employment.	4.878641052966492
The debate is closed.	0.03729499922396469
This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment.	5.212294245843319
Finally, intervention by the European Union to solve the problem of FYROM' s name - which is unfortunately becoming a long drawn out problem and could make an already tense situation even more fraught - and to respond more energetically towards negotiating FYROM' s principles within a reasonable time scale, is necessary and useful.	6.553816026792814
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women.	6.001616783098843
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States.	5.224976318439784
If they are proven not to be, we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority.	5.312424912974208
Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft, which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998?	7.515802183565757
This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses.	5.087257486700673
I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week.	6.117227348171659
The amount of budget required by our cities - where 80% of the European population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in Europe, I believe, clearly indicates that the European dimension should be taken into account and that this URBAN programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail, not to prioritise and, therefore, not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities, by means of European funds.	5.7383530100878
The matter of excise taxes, to which the honourable Member is referring, is the prerogative of the Member State concerned.	3.348404363260215
That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process.	4.615836539107801
However, despite the fact that the volume is relatively small, it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action, which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments. This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources, greater safety in our energy supplies and, in the case of SAVE, to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy, thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set.	5.971207375867816
So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction, together with Parliament.	3.213850084250994
Policy on tourism is not, however, something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the European Parliament or by the EU as a whole.	3.859043779764147
(IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy' s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined.	5.749811028012636
Reform of European competition policy	2.4042437579888283
I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks, and that is why I am reiterating them here.	3.4033150052218337
Nevertheless, it raises some very basic questions.	5.619438879165034
If anything, the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO" .	3.3569024325862036
Mr Crowley, with regard to the presidency' s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations, particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless, I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome, and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them.	3.7878090425960713
It is on the last two that the elderly, in particular, depend.	2.819493375035043
Already weak economies are being further weakened in Africa by the AIDS virus.	6.65698336508725
First of all, the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement contains, as everyone knows, a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel' s commitments. This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements.	5.291049468420659
The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences.	5.35190374093882
That is why today we are asking not to have any nasty surprises in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism come Monday.	4.577554107551737
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators, but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion.	6.855078137404172
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.	6.393651618104966
I ask Mr Nielson, in his summing-up, to directly address those points in the resolution.	5.358805296070762
	-0.0
We, however, second the Council' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus.	4.294169028830803
The challenge of enlargement is political.	3.62645637767112
This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world.	6.871298134302893
This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region.	6.372055236933513
Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back.	6.510383574549081
We have made our views very clear to them.	5.610207712255091
We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce.	3.6351874325144804
Similarly, as concerns the field of justice and criminal law, which we have discussed today, I believe not only that the different criminal law, juridical and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated, but also that we must at last formulate common standards: an offence committed in Italy must also be viewed as an offence in Great Britain, Spain or elsewhere.	5.73487952850286
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful.	7.924203989798955
Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal.	7.557912736773508
In return for this, however, we want early notification obligations to be discontinued, rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them, and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his/her posting.	5.756418841221864
Having said this, some of our fellow Members clearly have qualms because the report by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipulating that there must be 40% female participating in research in Europe.	5.181433461267656
It is the Member States' parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty.	4.410003925990911
Five months are provided for this.	5.81794997406528
The convention, as you will be aware, also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur.	6.015322926894369
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore.	6.490274037940949
But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo.	6.677052857845803
I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales.	6.289185177607524
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.	5.5159679385545495
It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually.	5.8726639821753945
The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon, and will include seminars on legal issues and on women' s rights, and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part.	5.929454934667213
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier, who described the state of the world in terms of the economy' s reign of terror.	5.614390841293396
It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal, rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs, which are no longer solely connected with agriculture, in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also, for instance, in rural tourism, sport and cultural activities, environmental projects, SMEs, services, and so on.	4.275000521352043
Of course, the final trade-offs will be made, as in any institutional negotiations, and I think this is no bad thing, at Council level, especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government, who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands.	4.1828157607827245
The question of renationalisation: first of all, although it is not really necessary, I would like to point out and stress, several times if I may, that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that, as far as Regulation 17 is concerned, there is a risk of renationalisation.	4.237628233090035
This is an irreparable loss.	3.8756773540517866
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional, renewable energy sources?	4.970619599649006
As the rapporteur said, this becomes particularly important when tourism is appreciated as a unitary productive system because of its ability to absorb large quantities of agricultural and industrial products, services and transport and to create a significant amount of added value.	6.836955472113984
There is a substitute, which is used to vaccinate chickens.	4.761238394764893
The whole of the Union must have the same protection, a type of protection which prohibits counterfeiting, not only of currencies in circulation but also of currencies which will be in circulation.	5.605945931211614
So, in the first part on the new forms of European governance, the words 'federalism' and 'superstate' are not mentioned at all.	4.650174265580317
But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council.	6.083836633141904
In the area of environment, we are looking at ways to cooperate with Mrs WallstrÃ¶m; in the area of regional policy Mr Barnier is giving a lot of attention to this sector.	5.591201701201989
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.	6.885262502731389
Both biological and economic information are included.	4.724254654405734
Mr President, today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities.	3.889593187083261
But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied.	5.724206519452972
We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management.	4.550801441271432
Too late, too selective and too fragmented: this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community.	5.0363196920242235
I am more than happy to include Bulgaria and Romania in this, as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former Yugoslavia, plus Albania.	4.912136300792887
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen, strengthening and intensifying it.	5.933776404836458
For some time, we have all agreed on this notion, but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement, even if this comes at a price.	4.2289248397200785
He has fewer than 2 000 officers, and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000.	5.062275570784596
Consumers see their standard of living being eroded, poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition, in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business.	5.994070713325676
It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door.	6.764534149218696
We have experienced this in our own national and European history. People can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant.	6.947013511668367
With liberalisation, how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own, Greece, with its particular geographical features and its numerous, small but inhabited islands?	5.175142123689301
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell' Alba' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of. Take a look at Jean Monet' s memoirs.	6.946331434479623
The OHIM is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by June.	5.857176334676413
We shall now support your Amendment No 6, but I wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee.	5.388518335619275
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July.	6.88690086002938
This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union' s common foreign and security policy.	3.097302906296589
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start. I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly.	5.581428884115646
We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability, of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain, is part of that confidence-building mechanism.	6.307417679172147
However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment.	5.801557937492448
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware.	6.949553894255091
Report (A5-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta (COM(1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS))	1.0496455472891961
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics?	4.607729630884877
The first is that economic policy, employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional.	3.42353120445128
The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important, such as peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution, food security, fisheries and immigration.	4.338510354606019
Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, in the different political and security committees or in the military committee?	4.972498792553254
Financial control' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate.	6.796161604578125
It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term.	4.901232033122719
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years.	5.599594200212786
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	3.1105956564838246
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission, we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them.	4.550808839533564
After the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Leader of the Palestinian Authority, the Israeli Prime Minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 February, the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.	4.843534630325595
Thank you for the presentation.	1.333900003688309
We shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the Commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the States which consider this service essential to the citizen.	5.883019018652061
Secondly, to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7% of GDP to defence expenditure?	5.98281955123879
I want to emphasise, however, that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission, it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission.	5.089776866740058
That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role.	5.551066761850537
My group will not be supporting those amendments.	3.7580819544091364
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.1737769261132489
He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas.	4.789676302579131
Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done.	4.188671760547637
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, after his few hours working in this Chamber with these Members of the European Parliament, whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay?	4.7141052147258025
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme.	5.698758862073313
This proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases!	2.9837108389784444
Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions.	6.693573597501711
In addition to making up the majority of the population, women are also the most dynamic element in society: it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men, and in many of our regions, they are the main feature of the innovation, training, performance and flexibility development model.	5.8255754889442075
This is the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis.	2.5471773266955426
Thank you very much Commissioner.	0.9554098751860575
On the one hand, it continued to refuse to accept the term "European cultural policy" or other similar terms, even undervaluing the terms of the Treaty, and it defines "Culture 2000" simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more.	4.842458610510931
The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council.	4.248089800065438
We want instruments to prevent abuse.	5.536912627141751
Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered.	7.849036774921039
Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text.	6.424566650438148
Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt.	3.7574422069438733
I hope that Europe, in terms of social protection, will make a step forward, taking into account subsidiarity, for without subsidiarity, this would not be possible.	3.2914358344523067
Social growth has occurred only in those areas where the tourist market has given rise to the development of all the activities required to meet the needs of visiting tourists, thus creating an entire productive system.	5.594627191046153
So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country.	4.065807852802207
Can anyone argue with any persuasiveness that women are treated equally and fairly, that children have human rights or that people are not discriminated against because of their religion, belief, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, opinion, political affiliation etc?	6.792409061401831
Mr President, Commissioner, Mozambique is a young African country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy.	6.228287550310086
- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today, but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do.	4.037037028267743
Secondly, what does it propose to do about them?	4.953872349069001
For our part, we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes.	4.654086495900595
I welcome any questions, suggestions or proposals from the Members present.	6.592229802081262
Thank you for your attention.	1.2174904495699237
It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation.	6.429461950426996
Danube environmental disaster	-0.0
It is the service which remains closest to the citizens and which we call a 'public service' , which makes it possible for everyone resident within European territory to receive the service, and this entitlement must remain an acquired right, an acquis communautaire.	6.393585513601063
Indeed, we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many.	5.580692355957499
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations.	3.9670025835251583
We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end.	6.836157475564899
No, there must be no undermining of OLAF' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur' s intention.	4.454817921500774
The Council once again reiterated the need, in its December conclusions, to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and, in particular, to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented.	4.535283345367148
The debate is closed.	0.03729499922396469
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea.	7.492640847687042
The path which the Commission is walking is, in fact, obvious.	4.4791952766519385
Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO.	4.5453246881722515
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion.	2.4694531985808585
Are there any comments?	0.12345304107379776
In area after area, we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States.	4.797812313839774
This is not the Union' s only contribution.	2.8789664845696854
What has become of it?	4.9039020012545755
Finally, I would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency' s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union' s policies, and in particular in the context of its foreign policy.	2.8059084177208766
I do not think that I can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted.	5.438345355795134
At present dear colleagues, we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea, nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system.	6.279617801140937
Mr President, allow me to start with the conquest of Kosovo.	2.777068606177115
What I can say is that I hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible.	3.481794607958668
What is more, if we reduce manufacturers' liability on this issue, this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas, for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computers and other electronic equipment.	5.290751062373749
A flourishing tourist sector can be totally wiped out by an ecological disaster such as an oil slick.	6.1927858647406575
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay, conditions, staff representation rights and so on, but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters.	7.626543253722687
But we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure.	6.18679445081406
This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc.	6.519771979273292
Yet words spoken, written or signed are not in themselves enough.	6.875734645652578
On behalf of my group, but also personally, I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens' rights and guarantees, which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States.	4.859921215101583
If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level, this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action, including Community actions, on energy saving.	5.181261518862374
That is what this framework decision is about.	4.4221870500186835
Thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously.	7.262734228168611
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.	5.963399070359502
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel.	6.584936847066678
EQUAL stands for "equality" .	5.309217194847416
I just mention that to complete the view of the process.	4.743034654186668
Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration.	3.480819917838629
Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.	6.636932772522572
Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission.	3.5331810934308234
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, however worthy the cause.	5.932727080758717
I will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which I regard as the essential issue in today' s debate.	5.083777981369078
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.	4.6713760633471315
European competition policy, as we very often forget, is not just important for fair competition as such, but also for prices, growth and employment, and hence for the public.	4.47762549959895
Moreover, we are asking the Russian authorities to provide immediate clarification of conditions in the so-called detention centres, and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention, maltreatment or killing of civilians are laying themselves open to accusations of crimes against humanity.	6.920725024708414
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.	4.912065957871185
This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March.	4.183444150827385
I am quite sure that Mrs Kinnock' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations.	5.271998460467121
Reread the letter: The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat, Article 6 of the Treaty.	3.5149648711563892
Over recent years, these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed.	7.011689639503147
It is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme, because there remains a shortcoming in the report.	6.092642539549362
It is Europe's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster.	5.975856947184824
Otherwise, there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands. It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained, and the idea was, in fact, that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained.	6.029914963575701
The Commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion, to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union' s regional policy.	3.989340250150861
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship, many people were perpetrators too, although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt.	6.941474269409062
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative, opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area, even though it is true that more could have been expected, particularly with regard to access to the various strands.	4.425213790104024
Is it the product of mere foolishness or, more probably, of a deliberate strategy, which is the same throughout the world?	4.839914616148646
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	5.717186705592895
I would remind you of the fact that the Belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know-how and expertise from disappearing from the company.	6.601325812901213
Parliament' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy.	4.643564518527823
I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject.	5.247780261948899
We have no specific, concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency.	6.29669333029527
Mr Prodi reverts to the contested concept of 'governance' ; contested because it favours state intervention over a proper working democracy and refers to the notion as defined by the IMF, whose ideological agenda is predicated solely on liberalism and monetarism.	8.16777358250427
This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure.	4.90064850344841
I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes.	4.944099949645764
It is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the Commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole.	6.808209358444889
In Italy, we have begun to withdraw and recycle around 80% of old cars, but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in Italy industry often resorts to lay-offs and redundancies - and cause problems for workers in different parts of Italy.	6.608287031428715
But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation.	6.45829997204278
The Commission is fully aware of the fact that the draft we have before us is not perfect or ideal.	3.6130575005309282
But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued.	7.004525926034867
We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred.	6.228908329092546
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement, as did the President this afternoon, to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday.	5.351060043461064
So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets.	4.076567280462558
- (EL) The Freedom Party' s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union' s political future.	2.7787170342182206
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports.	6.637019666432496
We believe we have respected that commitment, and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the Commission.	5.749109831317987
Mr President, a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes.	5.861873921061093
Europe is a community of law.	2.953867798821032
In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission, we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close.	4.949603383181145
The European Union should be taking a more decisive role that goes further than merely providing financial support, although that is important, by promoting and guaranteeing reconciliation between the two communities through the setting up of fora and confidence-building programmes.	6.1145383452923205
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER, with the participants on the ground, with the local organisations on the ground, with many non-governmental organisations, with the churches, with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities.	5.418914482258751
There is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle, codecision procedure, and Conciliation Committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen, and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European consciousness.	5.135248442875477
The report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects.	5.923854192740802
Madam President, the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials.	4.994443369824335
Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred, all of which will boost the ACP countries' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy.	7.043578723823276
What could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for?	5.740969427176472
Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy' s turn.	4.345413725761537
It is nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other, even more delicate issues into account: the whole issue of double jeopardy, that of specialities, and that of the credibility of one Member State of the Union in respect of the judicial authorities of other Member States of the Union.	5.158005952605963
The EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria, which would be binding and of real effect.	6.720068227220913
I look forward to Parliament' s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward.	5.10595311651561
They want answers.	2.509838540197289
However, in the case of Sweden, the situation is different.	1.8354666768362682
Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration.	4.765705968354437
Children have lost parents, families are bereft, hopeless, helpless and they have lost absolutely everything.	7.369098233533342
Now is the time to devote our time and energy to aiding Cypriots from both sides of the "green line" in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long.	5.6516713098463
However, the Commission will be suspending its position, given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments.	5.844166273656779
Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach, but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community.	6.0145223480243075
The polluter should pay.	0.2838860566226203
Honourable Members, Commissioner, it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector, but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector.	4.768834945294651
I think that, under the present rules of the Treaties, the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation.	4.003012819040067
On the other hand, the Turkish Cypriots fear - and there is no point in trying to conceal this - that Turkey' s application for membership of the European Union may lead to greater flexibility in Ankara' s position on this.	4.10551673542346
On the other hand, we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find (a) materials that are easier to recycle and (b) to set up recycling industries.	5.058454824428343
The debates on UCITS gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee.	6.124917298843464
The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December, without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon.	6.686085351028515
And, finally, the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarified. Regarding this, too, there has been only silence by way of a response from the Commission.	5.0437571221674835
With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency, budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness.	6.308516800977107
As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96/71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force, no change is necessary.	5.22184675293594
Encouraging Turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the UN Secretary General.	5.545400073588339
I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that, in many cases, we will say this together.	6.583203174301398
This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own.	4.54202448458878
As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change.	4.919600751131686
The risk of counterfeiting increases. Counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire EU; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State.	6.474429380735171
These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes.	5.981591030755606
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Gallagher' s report on the fourth amendment of the Regulation on technical measures was not amended in our committee. It was actually approved unanimously for which I congratulate the rapporteur.	4.578039001613423
The creation of this taxation, of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by Professor LaurÃ©, could prove to be politically opportune, at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate. This is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of States.	7.228837948185037
I refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that is bending the truth.	4.579801238832138
A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States.	3.9175391121121113
But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies.	6.39659021916873
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts.	4.064510257086158
Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here.	7.277834438635418
When Mr Dalmau, the Cuban Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Assembly, he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known.	7.137557196861542
Then we shall follow the usual procedure, hearing one speaker in favour and one against.	3.6116229972891682
Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are connected to our development policies, our economic policies, our home affairs policies, indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions.	4.612811472515305
It is high time there was peace in the Middle East.	3.6597133746643746
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term.	5.316847740239556
My third point has also been mentioned already.	3.198720733855694
EQUAL remains crucial also to regions like my own, in the east of England, outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response.	6.755373711824041
.	-0.0
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century.	5.111048708505424
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?	6.444471262584742
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we need this directive.	2.0880228027175227
These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause, even in extremely minimal quantities, changes in the gender of animals and even humans, as is more and more being ascertained by scientists.	6.617706791373725
For example, in my own region, in Manchester, the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success.	4.155781618937145
As far as your question is concerned, this problem does not only apply to Denmark. It is not only Denmark which has matters pending.	5.468736154428895
The big question, however, is from what budget heading should this aid be financed?	6.009194576990672
Mr President, Commissioner, I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that, as far as the Council is concerned, the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE.	4.79661910376258
Thirdly, we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in Europe, but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital.	6.002301822781397
Parallel to this European strategy of social convergence, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required, together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees, accompanied by a concrete timetable.	4.018698477912463
However, agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues, and the representative of the northern part of the island, Rauf Denktash, has suggested three new topics: sovereignty, confidence-building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island.	4.572754859958122
I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain.	7.161622298762622
Mr President, Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has knocked everything off balance.	3.197643863624202
We should not overlook the fact that, although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery, they are by no means the only point.	5.1245757039287705
We have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that JÃ¶rg Haider stands for.	4.892250128500176
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women.	5.371549077294562
I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated, namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions, the consumption of alcohol will remain the same.	6.227058134799808
We could, in no way, agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package.	5.214639263695589
As you know, in our country, each village has its own local post office or at least a post box, with a collection every day.	5.535469173745896
Thirdly, we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports, that is in every port of the European Union.	5.2531689180958665
Firstly, the governments made a commitment at the Maastricht Conference of 1992 to include a legal basis for this issue in the Treaties. This commitment was not fulfilled in the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 and is therefore outstanding.	6.292075659856482
It means that in Fleetwood, 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April.	5.56337770521835
- (PT) Mrs McKenna, a large part of the problem you have raised relates to issues which are the responsibility of the Commission.	3.7164760155892105
Any analysis of economic development in recent years, if objective, will show, through the figures, that they have no political colour or orientation.	4.961505816649854
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product.	6.241472190824102
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred.	6.443382048461058
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER+ programme because of its comprehensive nature.	4.365987248376705
In addition, you should know that, on 4 June 1998, the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs, the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe.	5.339471898243105
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact.	3.5669580419739337
As forcefully underlined by this report, labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock.	7.600507667787912
Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy.	7.306543834043861
What are the Council's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	1.959590212880802
In rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost-effective, I believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent tendering conditions, so that all the market forces, and of course the existing postal services too, can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies.	6.159054023273301
Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence.	3.705617667422362
Even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks, we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective.	6.449746230295889

We have never before seen such serious, clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	4.473412205986447
But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process.	4.977710899320829
My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this.	3.24787400372057
However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic.	5.925115263669164
The fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom, which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced.	6.723480394321602
(Parliament rejected the request, with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions)	5.0744127860284385
I know that this is an extremely delicate issue, but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented.	5.468490312817414
I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position, in my view, with precision, clarity and commendable brevity.	5.514514024546627
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question.	5.05271906534651
The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace, security and stability.	4.225465624853216
However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about.	5.7015700536459235

Michelin caused a great stir.	4.8327172329067665
We need to provide alternative answers, otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe' s positive roles in history.	7.196872968480265
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis.	4.254396881695202
These feeder funds exist in the United States, which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system.	5.224537827930415
It should be acknowledged, however, that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members.	5.553009103665273
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda.	5.029072237228781
There is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy.	4.777248402747824
The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process.	2.4403464578350054
Secondly, we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation.	5.100308364939895
As regards rural development, which a number of you brought up, particularly Mrs Redondo JimÃ©nez, the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur: a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas, but also protection of the environment and Europe' s rural heritage.	5.43657849688643
Mr President, it has already been said that, after a war which engulfed the country in misery, Mozambique is now facing a natural disaster of terrifying proportions.	5.718726400883496
Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion.	4.84920159588479
In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.	6.373474655922962
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented, farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly, which resulted in their depopulation.	5.598228065785662
As far as I am concerned, at least, the principle of 'polluter pays' must be applied.	1.726303621528937
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union, from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy; even to the response by the 14, the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria.	4.165571006266056
I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role, that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process.	4.802792560577171
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.	0.6620648164847908
Saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate.	5.638764466489039
On the other hand, for the sake of simplifying procedures some highly debatable amendments have been included in the Berger report, one example of which is the establishment of a common information service for cards issued by a body in any Member State.	5.628935545540688
Scientific studies are now no more than a formality: water will be the main resource at stake in years to come, starting tomorrow.	5.391012677291975
As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage, I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament.	4.984585285024158
We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-minority.	6.7874469250496245
The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour.	3.208112262741881
In fact, it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission.	4.429474398557038
As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.	6.044373751239967
What is the Commission' s verdict on this?	2.73091769781115
It is a report which tries to give direction.	4.320258086200406
We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic, pluralist society in these countries with institutions, public structures, police forces and a structured civil society, but, above all, we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region, as regards both politics and the economy.	6.232856005813656
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions.	5.275232806745446
Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced, as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control, and which pollute the water quite substantially.	6.530193292660762
High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force.	5.462380523535022
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources, as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases.	5.696683196555381
We are now in a third period: in this third period, the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed.	5.178214818943407
The cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace, although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible.	6.629465629642014
Of course, every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case.	5.649974327025695
Macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match.	6.919595445684217
Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.	5.40304162564703
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East, even though, as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki.	6.506318772206794
The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature, which is nowadays too often being punished by man' s activities.	7.548005044804997
A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements.	5.21097417073659
(SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do.	4.275669701090266

The time has come, we feel, for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice.	5.63633976890255
As in employment strategy, there are four thematic areas: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament' s proposals.	4.062385357218692
We have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater.	6.00538091735278
I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport.	3.980737311215462
So, Mr President, I will walk away from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament' s intellectual and political support, which appears to come from all sides of the House, for competition policy, its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future.	4.4296296601192475
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it is for this chain to provide us with safe, healthy food which is produced, as a matter of principle, without any questionable or risky interim or end products.	4.535578388394389
All in all, though, I deem this report to be worthwhile.	3.0666654758168925
Women are systematically raped.	4.017212913814585
The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative, even if it does so timidly, on this subject. However, I agree with the previous speaker that, if paragraph 9 were challenged, this motion would clearly lose its substance.	6.04842400685476
Mr President, "Europe stands for ideals, values and principles.	4.055145171023193

I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat, when they met on Monday.	7.187445709740342
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime.	5.627095458799561
We cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters.	5.515593102843547
We would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies.	4.6171756039526874
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.	2.0213121114887573
Mr President, the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe.	2.148048207817272
That is what I would have preferred, personally.	3.4913832058938614
Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.	5.611966199850027
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?	1.5559642785077994
Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas.	6.609212386243901

One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation.	4.653285002695977
It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped.	5.262254099833109
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States.	4.006682491067826
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important, I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them.	7.34977072143534

At a more central level, there is a need for more effective co-ordination between government donors, international NGOs, indigenous NGOs and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted.	6.853869856109062
If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future.	4.312835376196446
Mr President, one of the saving features of this Parliament is that here we practise a consistent and active human rights policy: the flag flies high, as Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m put it.	6.637928371359854
Langen Report (A5-0073/1999)	1.1409012683097133
Mr President, comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means.	5.621519666153571
This resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the Chechen tragedy.	5.7822711279205015
Why not institute an oil boycott against Sudan, where a great deal of the fighting is still going on, with weapons, no less, funded by the oil companies which are based in the same areas where the refugees are?	4.996231198507789
How strongly is the single market established at the moment?	4.648943719614654
First of all: who should pay?	3.55256040741442
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson.	8.268042572970582
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan.	2.6933523967533186
Our own staff policy is outdated.	5.782206967787393
These offences must be punishable even if they relate to banknotes and coins denominated in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 January 2002.	7.927492301797822
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock.	5.117489683883166
The ingredients of this policy are well known. They are the stimulation of public and private investment, increased investment in research, education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise.	4.216013903319398
Consequently, I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003, and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003.	5.325030196358993
I welcome Parliament's support for that.	4.210548271124729
And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this.	4.933256417847231
I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices, eternal vigilance, not just outside our borders but within.	6.5407719562235505
We assent to the main thrust of it, but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage.	5.5785066398123595
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006, but that is another subject.	3.6656654919301492
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea.	7.134226188620316
It is, above all, the manufacturer' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car' s life-cycle.	3.5129348103429145
It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good.	4.86357592995169
Madam President, I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Graa Moura, and Commissioner Reding, for their contribution to the creation of this programme.	2.768251087658961
That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call.	6.070509658196566
Nothing could be further from the truth!	5.137211709431551
At the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic.	6.124069974045201
It is clear that in a process such as this, where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe, there is an on-going dialogue between the different parties concerned.	4.964361408918557
Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling?	6.440315263070346
Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse.	6.512010345517707

It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty).	6.550769642310926
All good things come in threes, especially in our policy area.	5.8314211440904495
As far as Cyprus is concerned, although the Council stated that a political settlement would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. It also stated that its decision on accession would be made without the above being a precondition, which I welcome.	4.67405120322195
Our objective, the committee' s objective, the Court of Auditors' objective is not to abolish financial control, it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control.	4.6440411240160575
Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled.	3.176544597547293
This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States.	5.6548880320878245
The eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature.	5.256741316421657
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, to thank the speakers and, of course, to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure, who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result.	3.687952082879765
It is we, our own people, who keep the war going over there.	5.321753205260231
Subject: New premises for the OHIM At present the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) is still operating from the same temporary premises, even though its new building was opened in June 1999.	6.9293656917031425
We are discussing last year' s discharge, but also the Commission' s responsibility.	3.2013268327250852
Hitherto this has been out of the question of course.	2.969304297211296
I wonder, since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber, whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government.	5.992950989068713
That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	5.438065259429705
We Socialists reject the liberals' naÃ¯ve optimism on this point.	6.278341848176292
Therefore, once more, we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision. Codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type, which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application.	6.222890414373764
She ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council, who is not exactly a stranger to you, how this presumed lack of coherence has come about.	4.640284491808625
The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution.	3.901347301075224
Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission.	4.692445054150562
A Communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity.	6.791028178004035
The directive remains in place.	4.849516860102774
I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens, both in personal as well as in social and economic terms, but a right which it is our job to assert, and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union.	5.760004350264096
For the sake of our credibility, we will have to speak with one voice when it comes to human rights and not act as if human rights within the EU are different from human rights elsewhere in the world.	3.855947902007164
Mr President, I welcome much, indeed most, of what has been said in this debate.	3.2736603085851668
And, in conclusion, Mr President, let me also insist upon the fact that, in addition to the measures proposed, there are also legislative measures and, most especially, adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives.	3.751188311702141
Parliament must therefore give its assent, because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence.	6.1613059554965055
We have made many promises in this regard, but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread.	5.2837666563795365
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.	4.664790828574112
Moreover, regarding these small businesses, we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in, the yellow card, instead of an immediate red card, which will be a large fine and will threaten the company' s very existence.	5.501712863507089
The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes.	3.532949370634674
Equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our Liberal agenda.	6.0871974927692065

Globalisation, free trade, and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy, were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue.	4.724423343484415
Turning to our development policy, I would say that the global context has changed drastically.	4.641966841013252
Unlike a number of Member States, the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far.	4.259867943199488
The common position is not ambitious enough.	1.2286011690567222
Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns.	4.161083984834137
And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account.	3.0968920932159008
Today, even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for.	5.976481977179907
This is a real political objective, alongside economic and monetary affairs, drawn up in collaboration with Member States, regions and local communities, with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming.	4.263144970014455
Since 4 July 1990, when Cyprus applied to join the EU, the European Parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.	4.205053646860481
I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted.	6.478841133300631
The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today, is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy.	3.669851637442654
Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone.	6.8495917782024645
I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions, not just between Commission and Parliament, but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge.	4.7784514539335055
I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing.	4.786295746908119
I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.	4.9497876168551525

The next item is the report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD)).	0.6115095209921512

However, there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime. A year ago, we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up.	6.321468270440452
To achieve this I was ready and I am ready to make certain sacrifices, but not just anything! Most especially, I am no longer ready to accept the formation of a liberal single market if Europe is not at the same time capable of defending the values on which it is based and which, in the 1960s, made me a committed European!	6.23480855259297

We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future.	6.832960304161501

This report confirms that whereas an average level of development is given a rating of 100, the ten so-called "strongest" regions reached an average of 158, and the ten so-called "weakest" regions reached a figure of around 50.	6.752663542315894
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I should like to start with a quote: "The Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme.	3.37346585720116
This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second.	5.0241189688233

He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change.	5.0385749239084365
One reason why I am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that I do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality, the response is 'Oh but we know you are not running things efficiently, we know that you have not spent all your commitments, we know there is some money in your back pocket' .	6.609454463741864
Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area?	6.204648630881481
The first is that this matter is sub judice in several European countries, and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system.	4.113061030512074
We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee.	3.7830123335714134
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union.	2.447705930112337
In that respect, nothing. On the contrary, extending the Community' s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden.	4.17717460743267
You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different.	4.762926871514038
Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America.	6.176597422039718
As a supplementary question, I should like to ask you whether, as the Portuguese Presidency, you have made provision for the rights of children, as such, to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the Charter.	3.264817914221772
Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting.	5.710697875357994

(FR) Mr President, before my friends and fellow Commissioners, Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou, in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest, I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG, which many of you have brought up and discussed.	4.789879977645797
What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers.	5.910822410782286
Free enterprise, free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the European Union.	5.205086200894486
Clear guidelines and indicators are required. At the same time, the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans.	5.425001606205953
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 .	2.7865365251452205
For 150 years, the postal services have been a public affair and, as such, just like public transport and the power supply, a core task of the national governments.	5.385640844334666
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation.	5.507425201940034
In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too.	6.388374865315839
As far as I know, that has still not happened.	2.897021533849078
Only then can we follow in the footsteps of the founders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.	6.081351498473246
Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women' s rights, I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, to today' s debate.	5.815924563521003
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way.	6.940581368773255
There are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting, this being a measure which we would encourage.	5.845025694690571
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe.	6.728397642919423
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berend' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.	5.414110281919202
Despite this, he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the War Crimes Tribunal against NATO after applications by Canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question.	6.87565018655874
It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up, one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone.	6.299740955890642
To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29, to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension, would be going too far, and these cannot be approved.	5.125680937788102
The human rights policy is also too selective.	3.2541507381506927
Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application.	2.4203658400404326
I would like to make two observations during this intervention, which stem from the report itself, given this Parliament' s obligation, in accordance with the Treaty, to produce a very succinct report, which does not go into depth.	3.882780062132882
While the report was being prepared, it was interesting to discuss the Union' s regional policy in general.	3.975358570366279
From this point of view we are slightly behind the times.	5.186905790069695
Question No 47 by (H-0088/00):	4.4656879210269524
I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects, indebtedness, assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety, humanitarian, educational and health-related issues, and also fields such as the environment, investment and access to information and new technologies. This also applies to the sphere of trade, where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies, and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States.	5.784490153800045
We need this at European level and internationally; we need something like a TÃV, an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany, which is compulsory every two years.	6.77478078334877
This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate, by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers.	5.934462703028401
No single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes, ranging from macro-economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting themes such as gender, environment, good governance and institutional reforms.	6.144830649356735
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget.	3.0620090090501404
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99):	2.2238588682652236
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives, but Parliament' s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained.	5.471636935809833
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed.	7.263011728086304
We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001.	4.343392792369809
However, we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements.	5.20983031166724
You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation.	5.5259091257650725
The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive.	1.6287198880557316
For example, Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler spoke in English about 'long-term capital for long-term projects' - this is an obvious issue.	5.970796048190927
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times.	6.307019386148729
Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission' s offices for several months.	4.982756263263169
The Union is simply doing its job when it seeks through its cooperation policy to encourage nations to espouse a platform of common values with it, of which democracy and civil liberty are the cornerstone.	8.035985887030206
In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.	7.1581001222521525
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.	6.154661333907335
In Europe, in your rapporteur' s opinion, this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years, not just once but repeatedly.	5.194470209877545
I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union.	3.6428488662681526
I repeat, a "serious and persistent breach" is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State.	3.788547797931945
Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union.	3.343858470410413
SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.	6.038176275082959
Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits.	6.2016795461821665
Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on European postal services with all the more satisfaction since it reiterates once again the position I have always defended in this House, which is the need for a high quality universal service, particularly ensuring this service in the least populated regions and rural regions, and there are some even in my small country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.	5.155264414796637
Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work.	4.560222963475552
We can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers.	7.005108069949467
Mr President, the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission, to whom it was to be granted, had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity.	6.168956895702446
After nearly 10 years, Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name, and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia.	6.774799577401205
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the Bureau and to the appropriate committees.	6.671948569003761
But I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament, in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised.	3.5502686142709488
Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding.	4.14231443053098
It is good that this directive should be established now, as, otherwise, Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time, a period of transition, which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy.	5.23714061157138
(Applause)	-0.0
You say that you are against war, but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that.	3.4958936687015383
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say.	3.5982662239766934
Mr President, I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate, not just because development is in general an important issue, but because it is also a topical one.	4.9595821421097614
In my opinion, the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe.	6.175147979051633
She would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the EU.	7.270027263428675
I shall read it in English, which is the original language of the resolution.	3.6684570243543644
It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights, work on which has just begun.	4.249994816632755
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People's Party or does the Austrian People's Party continue to sit in that political group?	6.798991185637158
In any case, we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action.	5.521882770391784
I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba.	5.519839810351514
It is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions.	4.723372997945286
On south-eastern Europe, I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements.	4.167121770146145
I will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the Commission' s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other. I will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint.	6.105469292080904
The next item is the report A5-0036/2000 by Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93/53/EEC introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases (COM(1999) - C5-0168/1999 - 1999/0191 (CNS)).	3.4417733752991744
What are the Council's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	1.4706006669441696
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place, but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation, would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.	4.800603281979617
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.	4.051955658586799
The newcomers are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices.	7.568182300215607
Above all, we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice, hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations, in other words, its resources.	3.10831177497312
In this sense, the USA is not only our partner; it is also our competitor; not our opponent, our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model.	7.112237303682031
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.	5.826693582541563
I can only warn you against consenting to this.	6.217970740938406
Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals.	3.7755533218700608
We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement.	6.14468543032847
Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us.	4.90039845561705
It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet.	4.788365866218177
The account of the Dineh Indians is telling.	4.902957540751684
We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member.	1.8403500017137393
Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks?	2.6677814627849803
For example, I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component, namely refugees.	4.230313049358699
This is a positive development in itself, especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue.	5.653793005919101
There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion.	3.7755070926499616
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available.	5.7906308354170415
However, in this context, Madam President, to allow us to work out the details, I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday.	3.6874899846973497
What is needed from the European Commission, the Council and everyone else, is a quiet determination, a quiet determination to continue the accession negotiations on both Cyprus and Malta without guile, granted that in the last analysis they are the most mature of all the countries seeking accession, so that this determination can act as a signal to anyone whose view may differ from the view we all agree about.	6.059542191522022
As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%).	4.562904359784547
We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history, in particular World War II, but also its policies on enlargement, on immigration, on race and its attitude to the European Union itself.	6.344454209851085
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune.	6.167678013487876
That, as you have said yourself today, means that you must also identify tasks, policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission's main vocation.	6.0911735893548835
Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe' s culture, but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can.	5.594776395785412
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend Â£125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector.	5.962626242318627
We already have an infrastructure.	3.54566626087176
A country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself.	6.881620691015917
They are trading this in for a head of government' s position and for membership of a government.	6.342906724235554
Such a European strategy will be achieved through building on the commitment by Member States and the Commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas: exchange and dissemination of information, notably through new technologies; training in order to upgrade skills, quality of tourist products and sustainable development in tourism.	5.580274062596551
Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy.	5.76490290374234
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.	4.560991510441661
I must say that I support these reduced deadlines, especially as provision is made for derogations.	4.697021008263757
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the Commission' s own initiative.	3.4943034711286436
Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation.	6.870154741739834
The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems, just as it does in the foodstuffs industry.	6.304224218667699
I want to see civil society given a louder voice.	5.735563849276781
I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission's position on the report.	1.9624694018929574
. (DA) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the Joint Assembly for its work in 1999.	2.319316450381048
Here in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned, your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.	4.166724135193745
My group's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster, just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions.	6.527659356566798
This procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group, and the matter will only be submitted to the Council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter.	4.164729345067043
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to.	3.913112180699795
It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and, as such, a condition for political legitimacy.	5.329591968772894
Madam President, I thought I had three minutes.	2.6537075480054173
The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept.	7.139052932289582
I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union' s role in international development policies is significant.	3.837942151992946
Mr President, Commissioner, we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading.	3.857751902276653
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state.	6.5309575979547985
The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year.	5.142365752746175
The European Union' s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China, but an EU vote against the no-action motion.	6.151986647247446
Mr Solana has confirmed our view that, in a militarised European Union, NATO will have the upper hand.	5.764848820146352
Freedom, security and justice are the root system of any society, reflecting its history, corporate experience and political development.	6.668061263732721
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets.	6.813231036920092
We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War.	5.467662117926959
We cannot agree to this, since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States.	5.316826970246088
Our group will, at any rate, do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including, for example, the way in which the costs are to be distributed.	4.260437761586915
A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation.	5.267914386004182
The Nicosia Government has expressed its satisfaction with the Helsinki conclusions, which open up the way to accession to the European Union without solving the partition of the island beforehand.	5.631645807258323
But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself.	5.936052610095682
There is now a new Commission.	2.4946074517380077
Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested.	8.110177439171704
Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU ought only to have limited powers, except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union.	4.61287452621244
I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives.	6.205962135640794
Water is a prerequisite for human life.	2.9120751611970737
I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months, and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting.	4.8763434413064015
This was the first pillar of my recommendation.	4.956616364160579
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid.	5.102429068159467
We all agree that we should ask that, halfway through these programmes, when the assessment of the directives is made, Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens' representatives.	4.884299076402609
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment, ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening.	4.033301527236957
In this regard, too, I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate.	2.9809570701401897
At Tampere the Heads of State and Government also emphasised the importance of approximating national legislation on conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals based on a shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments in the Member States as well as the situation in the countries of origin.	4.530815941312183
However, it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.	5.91195037770243
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin.	7.084410987872611
In this respect, it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional.	2.6646498210601925
We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime.	4.817923924355903
The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere;	5.171609360698891
It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States.	5.35146161744136
If we look at the private sector, however, we will find not only that this fabled 'financial stability' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.	5.908191732288668
These numbers represent, in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council, a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80% laid down in Council Regulation 685/95.	3.8281850370319694
It is also true, however, that, since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements, 39% of the territory of the West Bank has been handed over to the Palestinian National Authority, together with two thirds of the Gaza Strip and, more importantly, this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with, since, under the terms laid down in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Israeli Government has the right to delay that handover.	4.432572332859607
You may therefore be satisfied on this point, since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by Objective 2.	6.792426454212106
Unfortunately, it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality.	2.976596298770971
In a world characterised by permanent change and in the context of high levels of unemployment, the rules in force seem to us to be outdated as they do not allow or promote the key ideas behind our employment strategy and our approach to change, anticipation, risk prevention and employability.	6.302095272440861
