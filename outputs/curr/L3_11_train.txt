Since mitochondrial diseases lead frequently to severe phenotypes and are often hereditary, there is a need for genetic counselling of the affected families.	1.031224474352995
The specific features of mitochondrial genetics, however, hamper straightforward definition of recurrence risks as in Mendelian diseases.	1.0427844585349482
Empirical risks were recently provided for MELAS and MERRF syndromes and for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.	0.7200403929642137
In MELAS and MERFF, higher levels of mutant mtDNA in the mothers' blood were associated with an increased frequency of affected offspring.	0.9281790487736904
Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and Kearns-Sayre syndrome are in general sporadic disorders without increased recurrence risks in the offspring.	0.8665257866011032
As Leigh syndrome is found with maternal, autosomal recessive or X chromosomal transmission, the definition of the molecular defect is crucial for genetic counselling.	1.0076409269809168
Prenatal diagnosis was reported only in one case of mitochondrial disease so far, and in our opinion it remains questionable because of the uncertain correlation of the proportion of mutant DNA in chorionic villi and in  clinically relevant tissues such as brain.	1.2408511979337578
An accurate and complete depiction of the halo naevus has been left by Matthias Grünewald in his painting "The Temptation of St. Anthony", which is part of the Isenheim altar piece (1512 - 1516), which is now exhibited in Colmar, Alsace.	1.135476710852867
In contrast, Sutton in 1916 only described a "leucoderma acquisitum centrifugum", leaving the nature of the central lesion in the dark.	1.1509908183139865
The term Sutton naevus therefore appears less appropriate than the alternative eponymic designation "Grünewald naevus".	0.7903477999061211
In women with breast cancer, staging of the tumor plays an important role and often is considered to be the most prognostic and therapeutic factor.	1.1899203204838735
The most widely used staging system is based on the pathologic TNM classification.	0.8435776779317811
In recent years conservative therapies such as preoperative chemo- or radiotherapy are used more often with limited tissue evaluation resulting in insufficient or even inaccurate staging data.	1.051354461289649
Tumor size as well as nodal involvement is decisive in selecting a treatment method and assessing the response.	0.9033859557273355
Thus, more accurate preoperative in vivo staging is necessary.	1.206734353274545
This article therefore gives an overview of the different imaging modalities (mammography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine) used for breast cancer staging.	0.9841889252007523
Furthermore, results of these methods are compared critically with the pathohistologic staging.	1.3583572714006789
The lack of muscle control in neurological disorders often leads to deformities of the foot.	0.6861267321120758
The equinus (a contracture of the triceps surae muscle), the abduction and clubfoot deformity are the most common ones.	1.1380590118823017
The present paper describes the deformities and stresses the functional relevance for the patient.	0.8066980372353071
Therapeutic principles of the conservative orthopaedic means are described with special emphasis on the need of an adequate height of the aide and the foot position.	1.0921288011696426
Casting and the application of Botulinun toxine are described having a major side effect of muscle weakening.	0.8379448199343567
A combination of the different procedures, surgical interventions included, need to be selected for each patient offering the best management for each individual problem.	1.1604252731236908
Still's disease was originally described as one form of rheumatoid arthritis in children beginning with fever and other systemic symptoms.	1.0244312906543103
In rare cases it may also begin in the adult and is then referred to as adult-onset Still's disease.	1.0089920335396751
The diagnostic criteria include typical rash, arthralgias, bouts of fever, and leukocytosis, as well as lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, liver dysfunctions, non-infectious angina, and absence of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies.	1.057242047109102
We report two adult patients with longstanding disease whose exanthema guided us to the correct diagnosis.	0.9368903640728871
The rash is a finding with high sensitivity.	0.8595302172895006
It is characterized by red macules with distinct borders and is evanescent.	0.733971848766523
During an acute flare of the rash, gentle friction induces erythematous, isomorphic (Koebner) phenomena, which, as we describe here for the first time, may persist longer than the remainder of the fleeting rash.	1.0381393002018369
Objective: Patients in a surgical intensive care unit (ICU) have a high incidence of nosocomial infections which often lead to septic shock and death.	1.2245357752640254
Since calculated antibiotic treatment is often difficult, it was recommended to obtain routine nose/throat swabs in order to have a better idea of the causative agent when a systemic inflammatory response occurs in a given patient.	1.1465341554029216
Methods: In 1435 patients of our cardio-surgical ICU, routine nose/throat swabs were taken three times a week and tested for micro-organisms and resistance to antibiotics.	0.9515031220117649
Of these 86 patients developed clinical signs of systemic inflammation, and additional blood cultures were obtained.	0.9308496679396838
Antibiotic treatment was achieved to cover the microbes from the nose/throat swabs, or a calculated dosage was given to patients whose swabs had tested negative.	1.0929719077026263
Results: Of the 86 patients with systemic inflammation, 29 had blood cultures positive for microbes.	1.2860327293641052
Of these 29 patients, 18 received a calculated antibiotic coverage based on their positive nose/throat cultures prior to the return of the blood cultures from the lab.	1.1307838577757632
However, in only 11 of the 18 patients were routine swabs and blood cultures positive with the same microbes.	1.28010009307704
While positive routine swabs are quite specific for sepsis when there is a systemic inflammatory response, routine swabs are not a suitable screening tool due to their low sensitivity.	1.0431321090017975
Conclusions: Routine nose/throat swabs led to earlier specific antibiotic treatment in only 22% of our patients with clinical signs of systemic inflammation.	1.144950500786669
In addition, in almost 40% of the cases organisms detected in the routine swabs and blood cultures were not identical.	1.3565455669414828
As a result, we feel that routine swabs are only of limited value in instituting earlier, specific antibiotic treatment in septic patients.	1.0603592517702676
The influence of defensivity, measured by validity scales of personality inventories (MMPI-K, FPI-R, GIESSEN-Test) on test results and psychotherapy outcome was studied in 309 patients treated with inpatient client-centered therapy.	0.9322671575081836
In general, psychotherapy patients exhibited low defensivity.	0.8003177503779864
25% of patients, who denied psychopathology at admission, did so at discharge and to some extent at follow-up, demonstrating an "especially good outcome" (means).	1.0363197568996265
Relative improvement (effect sizes), however, was significantly diminished in psychopathology scales and significantly enlarged in validity scales.	1.1740111417680088
- Results are discussed with regard to prior hypotheses about the influence of defensivity.	0.930232861511536
In our study we tested 2 different rapid assays for cardiac troponin t (TropT-rapid assay, diagnostic cut-off 0,2 ng/ml and TropTsensitive-rapid assay, diagnostic cut-off 0,1 ng/ml) in 75 chest pain patients.	0.9664503273413859
Additional to the emergency ECG (3-lead) we acquired a 12-lead ECG.	1.2348078245518592
The TropT-rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 11% (specifity 94,3%).	0.8746151580042529
The TropT sensitive-rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 62% (specifity 100%).	0.8789108406685826
Despite the great number of publications during the last 10 years concerning the indication, technique and results of operative treatment of acetabular fractures, conservative treatment still has an important role when considering the therapeutic possibilities.	1.1138766492706564
Because of the modern techniques of radiological imaging and improvement of diagnostic facilities, a more defined indication for treatment becomes possible.	1.1202440246473702
Conventional X-rays, completed by special projections like the Ala and Obturator view, and a CT scan allow determination of the fracture type (the Letournel/Judet classification or the AO classification).	1.1784881859261391
The most suitable treatment can then be adapted to the individual circumstances of the patient, i. e., age, general condition and overall severity of traumatic impairment.	0.9438179222831667
Determination of the intact part of the weight-bearing dome is important in selecting the most adequate therapeutic procedure.	0.9121193828764569
The larger the intact roof arc, the better the prognosis.	0.9208288588632877
Together with the X-ray controls following axial and facultative lateral extentions, the indication for conservative treatment can be confirmed.	1.0249484121886867
Early active motion of the injured limb, followed by walking exercises with partial weight-bearing, are important aspects of nonoperative treatment.	1.1303784620905564
Conservative treatment is recommended in non-displaced fractures or in fractures with little displacement, transverse fractures of the lower region or severely comminuted acetabular fractures with no possibility of reconstruction.	1.1110365093929868
Our clinical and radiological follow-up of 97 patients with acetabular fractures from the years 1981-1990 showed that the majority were treated conservatively (approx.	1.121361385481554
The functional result after an average observation period of more than 70 months was good or excellent (based on the Merle d'Aubigné score).	0.9638503661317567
We feel it is important to look at operative and conservative treatment of acetabular fractures as two complementary non-competitive therapeutic methods.	0.9396085013944279
The choice of treatment should be based on an exact diagnosis considering fracture type, the individual circumstances of the patient, and application of the necessary diagnostic facilities.	1.12166515764569
Conservative treatment can lead to excellent long-term results.	0.8022097244450102
Problem There is a great need to expand current knowledge of the various functional capacity measurements used in the rehabilitation of chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients.	1.0992587641707567
The literature on these patients reports that mobility, endurance, trunk strength and lifting capacity decrease during the process of chronicity.	0.9363346409961928
Chronically disabled patients appear to have lower functional capacity than asymptomatic persons.	0.8158421795387116
Methods Our study group consisted of 90 disabled CLBP patients (44 female, 46 male; average age 42 years) who underwent a multidisciplinary 8-week daily treatment program of functional restoration with behavioral support (instruction, endurance training, strength exercises, behavioral and treatment to facilitate return to work therapy).	1.052659185947879
Initially these patients where compared with 107 asymptomatic persons (44 female, 63 male, average age 41 years).	0.8378622568168433
The patients were investigated before and after treatment, and at intervals of 6 and 12 months.	1.2870364415372435
The reliability of the functional measurements was evaluated by interrater comparison.	1.0287568163488952
Physical assessment included a medical examination (mainly diagnosis of radicular or nonradicular pain), changes in the lumbar spine revealed by X-ray studies according to Herron and Turner [50], rating of physical impairment according to Waddell [117], flexibility, length of hamstrings muscles (SLR), test of power and endurance of trunk movement by standardized exercises according to the Swiss group of Spring [102] and isokinetic measurements (LIDO Back), tests of lifting capacity (LIDO Lift), and (in part) of general endurance on a cycle ergometer (CASE 15 Marquette).	1.1800086973722874
Results Physical findings showed that mobility was reduced substantially in patients suffering from back pain due to reduced SLR (shortened hamstrings) and decreased spinal mobility.	0.9458115547444069
Patients also demonstrated significant reductions in their ability to perform lifting tasks in comparison to healthy individuals.	0.953086709623832
The results of trunk flexion showed no significant differences between patients and the control group, whereas the ability to perform trunk extension was much better in the control group.	1.1027749474359845
In principle we found the same results with isokinetic measurements as in the exercises without machines.	1.060098833452047
Cardiovascular endurance was also much better in the control group than it was in the back pain patients.	0.9820024379377884
At the end of the treatment program all physical deficits were improved significantly.	0.9572264464968756
In many cases performance was comparable with that of the control group.	0.8999140386965957
With time, however, training effects gradually decreased.	1.0430616497355005
The success of treatment (return to work, absence from work, pain reduction, use of medical care) was independent of the functional status of the patients before and after treatment.	1.2058940021970006
Conclusion Study results showed that physical capacity in disabled patients with low back pain is substantially reduced in comparison to persons who do not suffer from back pain.	1.0455115957932823
The only exception was in trunk flexor strength and endurance, in which measurements did not differ between the patients and the control group.	1.2330548780833526
However, even CLBP- patients with long-term pain and severe physical illness can successfully improve their physical condition by participating in an active treatment program.	1.261043029142338
Back extensor muscle training has to be included in physical therapy.	0.8401775619031994
Because of loss of condition during the time after treatment, regular monitoring of patients and their home training programs is necessary.	1.0653468199813296
Overall, treatment of CLBP has to include physical training and psychosocial treatment to achieve satisfactory results.	1.0761107844628988
The dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain is very complex and is frequency-dependent.	0.8401138969553107
To date, this has still not been fully investigated or understood.	1.0327346659846737
There remains a lack of measurement procedures to pick up the motion of the ossicles and ear drum simultaneously with sufficient resolution.	0.9515895428395038
The presented paper reports simultanous measurements with laser-Doppler vibrometry at two points of the ossicular chain of cadaver specimens.	0.9017838249914234
Motions not observed were derived using mechanical simulation models on a computer and then evaluating appropriate mathematical equations.	0.8489177353790079
Using a sound stimulus, the displacement velocities of the umbo and stapes footplate were measured, and the corresponding transfer functions were derived by Fourier transform.	1.0793821445977545
Results were used for verification of the computer models.	0.8796955998312711
In the current investigations these models were refined and allow for the detailed investigation of the dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain, facilitating the optimal design of passive and active middle-ear implants.	0.9841047954183266
Problem: Postoperative nausea and vomiting remains an important problem.	0.9977450815925492
Many risk factors have been identified; however, the importance of postoperative analgesic technique and patient expectation remain poorly defined.	0.9824525587585923
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are probably not only unintended, toxic side-products of oxygen metabolism in mammalian cells, they also have several important physiologic functions including antimicrobial killing, regulation of cellular proliferation and growth, and regulation of vascular tone.	1.056226958292887
ROS are generated within the vessel wall by several mechanisms, including a vascular type of a NAD(P)H oxidase.	1.0923906590091468
ROS formation can be stimulated by mechanical stress, environmental factors, the peptide angiotensin II, cytokines, native low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and in the presence of catalytic metal ions.	1.0631881814905226
Their ability to modify LDL, react with endothelial-derived nitric oxide subsequently forming peroxynitrite, and amplify the expression of various genes important for leukocyte recruitment within the arterial wall are the basis of the oxidant injury theory of atherosclerosis.	0.980504727904624
In animal studies, antioxidant therapy (probucol, butylated hydroxytoluene, N',N'-diphenylendiamide, vitamin E, superoxide dismutase) have been successfully used to prevent fatty streak formation, and to restore impaired nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation.	1.0556344844124732
In man, antioxidant therapy (e.g., supplementation with vitamin E) clearly increased the resistance of LDL to oxidative modification.	0.805355466326421
Case-controlled and prospective clinical studies suggest a relation between baseline antioxidant plasma levels and/or antioxidant supplementation and risk of cardiovascular events.	0.9244115126571201
In one secondary prevention trial (randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled), vitamin E supplementation reduced significantly the risk for non-fatal myocardial infarctions.	1.0872367511903709
Before general recommendations can be made, results of further large-scale trials should be awaited.	1.034799274216192
A 36-year old man suffered an isolated head injury with a fracture of the skull, epidural and subdural hematomas as well as brain contusion (Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS): 5 points).	1.087689042683816
The hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.	0.5066451200371247
Because of high intracranial pressure (ICP) a barbiturate coma was necessary.	0.8799779191644816
Additionally, the patient demonstrated acute lung injury (ARDS) due to pneumonia 8 days after trauma.	1.0846674491304793
The patient recovered slowly and was transferred to neurorehabilitation on day 57 after injury.	0.8152514834814684
During the following 12 months the patient developed a significant deficit of hip motion (extension/flexion: right: 0 °/10 °/20 °, left: 0 °/10 °/30 °; external/internal rotation: right and left: <5 °/0 °/<5 °; abduction/adduction: right: 10 °/0 °/25 °, left: 10 °/0 °/10 °).	0.9805627783616029
X-rays and CT-scanning revealed severe heterotopic ossification (HO) of both hips with ancylosis (Brooker type IV).	1.0894057484402548
Resection of HO was carried out in a two stage procedure using Smith-Petersen approach.	0.8910184093718769
The prophylaxis for recurrence of HO included preoperative single-dose radiation (8 Gy) and postoperative treatment with indomethacin (150 mg per day).	1.1213592672446682
The patient revealed 15 (left hip) and 12 (right hip) months after surgery the following range of hip movement: extension/flexion: right: 5 °/0 °/90 °, left: 5 °/0 °/100 °; external/internal rotation: right: 20 °/0 °/30 °, left: 20 °/0 °/20 °; abduction/adduction: right: 30 °/0 °/40 °, left: 30 °/0 °/40 °.	0.8937095448835038
No recurrence of HO was observed in x-ray.	0.8714134734677539
The patient is able to work in his profession as farmer.	1.044124263173299
Gastric teratomas are rare and mostly benign.	0.78301048349191
They frequently become evident as a palpable abdominal mass.	0.7366385571790448

Our method of reading the diagnosis and the subsequent therapy are described.	1.0583137167373924
The aim of this prospective study was to assess the clinical and prognostic relevance of patent foramen ovale - in contrast to risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardioembolic sources - in 208 patients with cerebral ischemic events.	1.262969673670463
All patients underwent neurological examination (Doppler, CT, NMR) as well as transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography.	0.9300405940073952
A patent foramen ovale was found in 75 patients (36%).	0.7656184246633514
With regard to risk factors for atherosclerosis patients with closed resp.	1.054244846844609
patent foramen ovale revealed significant differencies for age, hypertension, diabetes and use of oral contraceptives.	0.8421296710136762
Cardioembolic sources showed significant differencies for atrial fibrillation and atrial septal aneurysm.	0.7431930200609769
Multivariate analysis of risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardioembolic sources revealed hypertension and diabetes as age dependant risk factors in patients with closed foramen ovale.	0.8514223779340939
In patients with patent foramen ovale the use of oral contraceptives was found as an independant risk factor for cerebral ischemic event.	0.9665242688140878
Patients >60 years with cerebral ischemic events had more often a closed foramen ovale.	0.9563543362572614
Dependant on age patients with closed foramen ovale showed a higher frequency of hypertension and diabetes.	0.8937671972681858
In addition these patients revealed more often atrial fibrillation.	0.7786343322971675
Patients with patent foramen ovale had fewer risk factors for atherosclerosis or cardioembolic sources but presented more frequent the use of oral contraceptives or atrial septal aneurysm.	0.8956586375644262
A retrospective study of 86 motorcycle accidents that occurred in the year 1992 is reported.	1.0313973600754622
Examination of the case histories supplemented by telephone conversations yielded the following results: 90.7% of our patients were male and their average age was 28.8 years; the age group between 25 and 30 years was the most frequently involved (27.9%).	1.267662705435611
Most motorcycle accidents happened during weekend trips out in the summertime.	0.6957038127003313
Special injury patterns were found for injuries of the upper and the lower extremity.	1.223998904343222
Lower extremity injuries (46%), and especially open tibia fractures (19.7%), were among the most common injuries sustained by motorcyclists in crashes.	1.2013414127319255
Injuries of the upper extremity most frequently took the form of fracture of the distal radius (18.8%).	1.0952010470917226
The average stay in our hospital was 35.4 days.	0.9718489887662244
In 23.4% of cases the patients had to change their job after the accident.	1.3744228236619638
More than half the crashes happened with motorcycles with between 500 and 750 cc stroke volume.	0.8046519852577054
Over a third (34.5%) of the patients had held their driving licences for more than 8 years.	1.1520992212995127
A plea is made for more preventive measures, such as better driving instruction, better road conditions and legislative changes, against motorcycle crashes.	0.9304727246926257
From the aspects of cost and the rate of complications it is reasonable to strive for a surgical treatment as soon as possible after the crash.	1.0631111005074612
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is a syndrome affecting an extremity after a minor trauma or operation.	0.9651058292188011
At the moment there is no consensus about the pathogenesis of RSD.	1.1061875497153788
In 1942 Paul Sudeck suggested that the signs and symptoms of RSD may be provoked by an exaggerated inflammatory response to injury or operation of an extremity.	0.9305600126813595
His theory found no disciples, as most physicians believe that RSD is initiated by an hyperactive sympathetic system.	1.0029964017405284
We performed various clinical and experimental investigations, including the effects of antiinflammatory treatment.	1.0475667442626024
The results of these studies support the theory of Paul Sudeck.	1.0233945235636415

Women with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy tolerate pregnancy, labor, and delivery surprisingly well.	0.854935789135115
Vaginal delivery is possible, but epidural anaesthesia is contraindicated.	0.9558755492474255
Hypertensive disorders associated with pregnancy are classified into three groups: chronic, treatment, and preeclamptic hypertension.	0.944446324550925
Whereas chronic and transient hypertension do not affect the outcome of pregnancy appreciably, pre-eclampsia presents a potential danger to mother and fetus.	0.8844858470570204
Pre-eclamptic hypertension is accompanied by low cardiac output and plasma volume.	0.786316032218935
An upregulation of angiotension receptors enhances vascular reactivity, with the consequence of high peripheral resistance.	0.9764106456328739
For antihypertensive therapy hydralazine, -methyldopa, and magnesium sulfate are the drugs of choice.	1.149443820011556
A generalised recommendation of anaesthesia for the pre-eclamptic gravida cannot be made because both general and epidural anaesthesia have risks of severe side effects.	0.9136525271419271
CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaws (DentaScan) is the method of choice for the radiographic assessment of the mandible and maxilla.	1.1341282813675329
It is instrumental in delineating the relationship between bony lesions and the adjacent anatomy.	0.822926388708722
Therefore, this technique allows precise evaluation of the intricate details of the oral cavity.	1.2287667057583476
Using it, distinct characterization of pathology including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions can be obtained.	0.9268190122661244
The histopathology of bone marrow in primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is described, with reference to the FAB classification.	1.2176030007832268
Variants such as hypoplastic, thrombocythemic and fibrotic MDS are recognized from their histopathology and must be incorporated in the FAB classification.	0.7605562080924049
The clinical significance of hypoplastic, thrombocythemic and fibrotic variants is illustrated by the survival rates and leukemic transformation in these patients.	0.8161860651139111
Histopathological classification according to the FAB system corresponds with cytological classification, as proven by the distribution of the subtypes, blood values, leukemic transformation rates and survival times.	1.0743063731323759
Finally it is even possible to elaborate a prognostic score for survival based on histological features of diagnostic biopsies, which emphasizes the importance of histopathological examination of bone marrow in MDS patients.	1.0886913569295174
A 58-year-old man developed an extensive pilomatrical carcinoma in the left axilla.	1.1428527463688487
Clinically, a squamous cell carcinoma was suspected.	1.1470692734577352
Histological examination revealed the presence of proliferating basaloid cells with many atypical mitoses and mass necrosis infiltrating into the subcutaneous tissue.	0.9028708315718017

Introduction: Recent studies evaluating lay people and health care professionals about their process-quality checking the carotid pulse demonstrated poor diagnostic accuracy and more time needed than suggested in international guidelines for CPR.	1.0303769998930834
So far there was no scientifically prooved data about the quality of checking the breathing.	0.9544111004992654
Study objective was the evaluation of the  effectiveness of checking the breathing in  an emergency situation with four different groups: lay people (L), EMT /Paramedics (E), medical students (M), physicians (P).	1.3620261267566212
Taking into account the increase in worldwide human migration, leprosy is of growing importance in the differential diagnosis of dermatological diseases encountered in Central Europe.	0.9046923479966026
We report on the case of a young man from Ghana who developed hypopigmented maculae and plaques on his trunk and proximal limbs.	0.9423908220615377
The diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy could be made in consideration of the histological pattern of infiltrating leucocytes and detection of numerous acid-fast mycobacteria on skin biopsy.	0.9602076189073993
The results of the physical examination as well as routine laboratory and immunological parameters were consistent with this form of leprosy.	1.0364013889257555
Due to glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency, treatment with dapsone was contraindicated.	0.9373378596602697
With high-dose rifampicin and clofazimine therapy, the skin changes cleared over the course of 11 months following a leprosy reaction type II (erythema nodosum leprosum) that developed during a phase of discontinued therapy due to low patient compliance.	1.0844634957087211
In the last few years two placebo controlled studies (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Study) analyzed the effect of systemic thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute hemispheric stroke.	1.0052892060993472
Both studies showed a positive longtime effect for the rt-PA treated patients.	0.990651932553963
The number of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was higher in the rt-PA treated groups.	0.9169864219244546

The role of enteroviral myocardial infection in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy could only be substantiated after the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in-situ hybridization) in virological diagnostics of dilated cardiomyopathy.	1.107036040044996
By using histological and especially immunohistological techniques for the detection of myocardial inflammation in patients with the tentative clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, a differentiation between inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy on the basis of the WHO classification 1995 (31) was made.	1.2247107917563822
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined by myocarditis in association with cardiac dysfunction and is diagnosed by established histological and especially immunohistological techniques.	0.8901671864998569
The combination of histological, immunohistological, and molecularbiological techniques enabled a subgroup analysis of the incidence of enteroviral myocardial RNA in patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy in comparison to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.	0.9677835356254202
The Intended-Dynamic Group Therapy, until the unity almost unknown in West-Germany, represented the most important form of therapy in the former GDR.	1.0079882237845292
Its development, its conception of the relevant relationship between group-dynamic and psychoanalytic concepts and in particular its reception of psychoanalytic concepts are discussed.	1.020250611816814
This raises the question of defining the position of this therapy form with the focus on the controverse about its proximity to psychoanalytic therapeutical concepts.	1.0057717875134387
Even if we take into account that in the GDR there were very reduced possibilities to articulate psychoanalytic and particularly drive concepts, in our view the Intended-Dynamic Group Therapy cannot be considered as a psychoanalytical form of therapy.	1.1602690014195542
It represents a specific therapeutical development of the former GDR which is strongly oriented at social norms.	1.0443408307772772
It is first of all oriented at the attitude change reached by the group, that means, at the manifest, conscious behaviour of the patient and therefore focusses at the normative level of behaviour regulation in groups in the sense of interactional group therapy.	1.1202043636792194
The authors view this form of therapy as a "historical compromise" in the field of psychotherapy under the circumstances of the former GDR and in this way they take into account both its advantages and its weaknesses.	1.1989070590104494
In a prospective study of central fractures of the talus, radiological data (plain radiography, CT, MRI) were scrutinized in terms of correlation with histological findings (biopsy taken at time of screw removal).	1.196736948304986
The study looked at nine fractures in eight patients aged 14 - 48 years.	0.9921454988201631
There was one fracture of Hawkins type I, one fracture of type II, four fractures of type III, and three corpus fractures.	1.268855689958187
All were operated on within 24 h after injury; seven had screw fixation, two had adaptation with K wires.	1.021700693178241
The patients were kept non-weight-bearing for 14 - 53 weeks.	1.167235241513719
Duration of follow-up was 2 years or more in all but one patient.	1.2094384326396923
In the final radiograph the talus was intact in four patients, while four showed a partial avascular collapse; in one patient, a partial collapse was doubtful.	1.2206789903956778
Histology taken 16 - 52 weeks after injury showed osteocyte-free original bone in all cases, with deposition of new bone varying in extent.	1.0522324849587545
Hawkins sign was partially positive in six patients, positive in one, and negative in one.	1.046673198906755
Decalcification as well as fracture healing can be better followed by CT than by plain radiography.	1.010113104072865
MRI appeared normal in five patients, partially pathological in two, and abnormal in one.	1.1222195053448656
A positive Hawkins sign and normal signal behavior can be seen as prognostically favorable signs.	0.9091515332800612
However, in the case of a central talus fracture, even with a favorable course osteonecrosis of at least a part of the talus with gradual replacement by new bone occurred.	1.2861307269589974
Vascularization of the central talus seems to be disturbed more frequently than is reflected radiologically.	1.0983864748986518
Purpose: To assess the value of functional magnetic resonance urography for the noninvasive postoperative evaluation of renal transplants.	0.887150197052838
Methods: A saturation inversion projection sequence allows the selective imaging of strongly T 1 weighted signal from the MR contrast agent.	0.985038980514861
A coronal slab leads to images comparable to conventional urography which can be acquired as a sequence with four images per minute.	0.8831188662936861
Results: 15 patients with urologic questionable findings after renal transplantation were studied.	1.1386778900972303
FMRU revealed in 6 patients normal findings, in 6 moderate dilatation of the renal pelvis without any urodynamic relevant obstruction.	1.1407676206265709
3 pathologic findings, ureteral leak, ureteropelvic-junction obstruction and ureteral stenosis were diagnosed and consequently surgically treated.	0.8672814547497226
The imaging quality in all studies was diagnostic and urologically relevant.	0.8505957709385686
Conclusion: FMRU can be used as a noninvasive technique for the assessment of renal transplant in cases with suspicion of complication in the excretory system.	1.1702572206660053
The infection after intramedullary nailing is a severe complication, which is hard to eradicate.	1.1223527547056416
The results of reaming the intramedullary canal after removal of the infected nail were evaluated in our investigation.	1.0475060039968533
From 1984 to 1991 fifty-five patients with infected intramedullary nails of the lower extremity were included in this trial.	1.0001538998069393
Twenty-one patients had an infection of the femur.	0.9229756352263842
Thirty-four patients had a primary infection of the nail, twenty-one patients had multiple operations with periods of infection prior to nailing.	1.106834627446678
All patients had signs of a chronic osteitis and sinus formation.	0.9136430217262722
At the time of the follow-up the success of the procedure was evaluated regarding recurrence of infection, range of motion of the extremity and patient comfort.	1.1547328960943997
The mean time of observation was 10,1  +/-  4,9 years.	1.2012771578730221
All patients with initially infected intramedullary nails had no recurrence of the infection, compared to 62 % of those with multiple operations prior to nailing.	1.1417410863738824
At the time of the follow up all fractures had healed.	1.087787437699178
85 % of the patients performed full weight bearing.	0.9708085500988838
32 patients (91 %) had good or excellent ROM of the adjacent joints.	1.0824247071370272
The discussion about the therapy of the posterior cruciate ligament persists.	1.1136571156042228
Conservative treatment, augmented repair, and reconstruction with autografts are discussed.	0.8212939655835106
From 1993 to 1997, 49 patients with posterior cruciate ligament rupture had repair Trevira ligament augmentation of 3 mm.	0.8960319505818846
There were 21 isolated and 28 combined ruptures.	0.7818688964433157
In 5 cases bony avulsions were refixed by screw or additional hook plate.	0.8137787430317281
Investigation of 36 patients, in 15 cases with isolated ligamentous ruptures was made.	1.1727510801148333
Osseous avulsion had good results in all cases.	0.8721103109491732
Isolated posterior cruciate ligament rupture showed good stability in 7 of 15 cases and instability of 2 + in 8 cases.	1.1171605368769197
The medial range Lysholm score was 76.8 (+/- 21.6), the OAK score showed 2 very good and 5 good results, 3 fair and 5 bad results.	1.1698705086007066
Using the IKDC score led to 3 very good and 4 good results, 2 fair and 6 bad results.	0.9664638601069213
Using subjective criteria, 10 patients described results as very good or good, 2 fair and 3 bad.	1.0843956348707335
Posterior cruciate ligament rupture with additional knee injury or fracture of the leg showed bad results in 60 % of cases, and good or fair results in only 40 %.	1.0950799120751598
We think augmented repair of fresh injury of the posterior cruciate ligament can be used as an alternative therapy to reconstruction with autograft.	1.1622792180588615
Through cooperation between the German Contact Dermatitis Research Group (DKG) and the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK), results of standardized patch tests performed by the participating centres are centrally recorded in Germany.	1.101148760917254
For this study, data from 24 departments of dermatology (19678 patients) were evaluated retrospectively and separately for 1995 and 1996.	1.1343063555128898
With decreasing frequency, nickel, fragrance mix, balsam of peru, and thimerosal yielded positive reactions most often; suprisingly high numbers of positive reactions were also seen with amerchol L-101 and palladium.	0.879774996073021
Differentiated lists of allergens were compiled for 1995, referring to subgroups of patients (defined by gender, age, localization of eczema, geographical region, occupation, sensitization) and particular problems.	0.953439540125483
In men, percentages of positive reactions were markedly lower for nickel, fragrance mix and balsam of peru than in women.	0.7112084867777746
Younger patients reacted more often to thimerosal and older ones to topical medical preparations.	0.7494713297277892
Medical allergens were also often positive in patients with leg eczema, whereas occupational allergens were found more frequently in patients with hand eczema.	1.0964473005658333
A comparison of positive reactions obtained in distinct geographical regions was problematic because of differences between test populations.	0.8935398433916092
The spectrum of allergens found in officeworkers was similar to that of the whole test population.	0.9565405130237292
Patients with positive reactions to nickel and fragrance mix had more positive reactions to unrelated allergens than the total test population.	0.9720473169649846
Sex- and age-adjusted frequencies of sensitization revealed a decrease in reactions to nickel and an increase in reactions to mercury allergens from 1995 to 1996.	0.9087138950964869
The clinical relevance of mercury reactions was often not apparent.	0.7903369285917358
Differentiated lists of allergens can be used to improve the quality of diagnostic and prophylactic procedures in allergic contact dermatitis.	0.9312590050378882
Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin (BT) induce a localized, long-lasting paresis of the target muscle that can be graded by the BT dose administered and that is free of major side effects.	1.0427919508580794
With this profile, BT can be used for symptomatic treatment of various disorders caused by pathological muscle hyperactivities.	1.0121044797207444
These disorders occur frequently in patients in institutions for neurological rehabilitation.	0.8892241025387376
They are difficult to treat with conventional methods, can cause major suffering and induce substantial costs for our health care system.	0.991062131174615
In the present study we therefore sought to delineate the use of BT in rehabilitative neurology.	1.021584623542988
Regardless of the etiology of the particular muscle hyperactivity syndrome, five main indication groups are identified: (1) improvement of function of the hyperactive muscles; (2) relief of pain in the hyperactive muscles; (3) improvement of patient care; (4) avoidance of sequelae in joints, tendons, ligaments, and teeth; (5) various special indications.	1.0530304689681949
Myocardial infarction shows a circadian pattern with a maximum in the early morning hours.	1.0664761242783494
In patients with sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD), it is assumed that apnea-associated changes of hemodynamics, blood gases, and rheology lead to a higher frequency of myocardial infarction during sleep.	1.2648110415483182
This investigation analyzes the circadian pattern of myocardial infarction in patients with and without SRBD.	0.8436351764543776
Currently no serological marker for the monitoring of uveal melanoma and its metastases is available.	0.86997165748124
The novel tumorassociated antigen Melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) is expressed in the uveal melanoma and it's metastatic lesions.	0.9849070045945968
Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with shortened action potential duration (APD) and reduced atrial refractoriness.	0.9914975409088349
Remodeling of ion currents responsible for AP morphology has been proposed as a major mechanism in persistent AF.	0.895108641165828
In the present study we investigated the activity of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel and the mRNA transcription of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel subunits in patients with persistent AF compared to patients in sinus rhythm (SR).	1.001003144481873
Right atrial appendages of 10 patients in SR and of 5 patients with AF were used for myocyte isolations to record L-type Ca2+ currents (ICa,L) by the patch-clamp technique.	1.1213238401654142
Right atrial appendages of 16 patients in SR and of 5 patients with AF served as sources for determining the mRNA expression of the L-type Ca2+ channel 1c-, 2/-, a-, and b/c-subunits by semiquantitative RT-PCR.	1.1463093286163928
ICa,L density was reduced by 70% (p < 0.001) in AF patients compared to the sinus rhythm group.	1.009217501470486
Cell sizes, expressed as cell capacitance, were identical in both groups.	0.8850812128286438
mRNA expressions of the 1c-subunit and the b/c-subunits were reduced in AF patients by 18.9% (p < 0.05) and 77.7% (p < 0.005), respectively, while mRNA transcriptions of the 2/- and the a-subunits were not significantly different between SR and AF patients.	1.1365079941797176
A decrease in the availability of functional L-type Ca2+ channels in AF patients, due to reduced 1c-subunit and substantial lack of b/c-subunit transcription seems to contribute to the shortening pf APD and refractory periods in AF, thereby favoring increased atrial excitation rate and perpetuation of AF.	0.97808380760518
34 patients aged 3 months to 20years underwent transcatheter-occlusion of their patent ductus arteriosus with detachable coils (Cook).	0.8883731923551931
Eight patients had a residual ductus after previous implantation of a Rashkind-occluder; 7 patients had various other cardiac malformations in addition.	0.982541421323224
Only 6 patients had a large ductus with a diameter between 3 and 4 mm; all had systolic-diastolic murmurs.	1.0676485379652707
All other patients had ductus-diameters below 3 mm; three of them had systolic-diastolic murmurs, 17 had systolic murmurs, and 8 patients had no murmur at all.	1.1240385649173776
The ductus was closed in 24 patients using artrial access only, in 6 patients via a venous, and in 4 patients both via venous and arterial catheterization.	1.263861889962787
One coil was used in 23 patients, 2 coils in 9, and 3 coils in 2 patients.	1.368149104514162
There were no complications of the intervention.	1.0346007929782148
Within 24 hours 31 patients (93%) had complete closure of the ductus and 32 patients (94%) after 6 months.	1.0843662895523443
Coil-embolisation of the persistent ductus is a quick, safe and cheap method to close a ductus and has clear advantages compared to an operation.	0.9398943527919744
The volume of preoperative screening investigations for outpatient anaesthesia ranges from few, selectively ordered investigations to extensive routine diagnostic procedures.	0.8485460009615017
It seem appropriate to reevaluate benefit and efficacy of routine preoperative assessment programs.	0.9289936900091931
The purpose of preoperative diagnostic is to assess the risk of anaesthesia and surgery for the patient.	1.3421051661628371
As shown by a number of studies, preoperative screening investigations seldom disclose new pathological findings of clinical relevance.	1.0774607192864603
Abnormal laboratory results in otherwise healthy patients rarely alter the anaesthetic management of the patient and are not related to perioperative complications.	1.0971384359247407
Extensive use of costly diagnostic procedures considerably increases health care budgets.	0.764063610436683
A more selective approach to order preoperative investigations promises considerable savings.	0.7808767624428343
To achieve costeffective evalulation an efficient organisation of properative assessment must be established to avoid costly delay and on-day-of-surgery-cancellations.	0.9613768440767325
There is no medicolegal obligation to perform routine diagnostic testing.	0.8789495409397481
The anaesthetist must be sufficiently informed in time to assess the perioperative risk of the patient and to alter anaesthetic management as necessary.	1.200517426216208
According to the presented studies a clinical history and a thorough physical examination represent an effective method of screening for the presence of disease.	1.1441323959385665
Careful medical history evaluation and physical examination can avoid extensive investigations in apparently healthy individuals and the latter should only be ordered if indicated.	0.9232429699332662
The botryoid odontogenic cyst (BOC) is considered a rare multilocular variant of the lateral periodontal cyst.	1.1293463753096828
The origin of the BOC can be seen in aberrant odontogenic tissue.	0.9306640675765734
The BOC is found especially in the premolar region of the mandible, as well as in the frontal region of the maxilla of patients aged between 60 and 70 years.	1.2379566626833216
Most of the 11 published articles of BOC have shown high rates of recurrence.	0.8720995120837501
Histopathologically the BOC is marked by multilocular cysts lined by a thin, nonkeratinized epithelium.	0.8374359248810787
Clusters of glycogen-rich epithelial cells may be noted in nodular thickenings of the cyst lining.	0.9117635297941068
For the clinician, the differentiation of the BOC from the keratocyst and ameloblastoma is relevant.	0.951302275244513
One case of a large BOC (65-year-old male, BOC regio 33-45, diameter 5 cm, radiographically and histologically multilocular) is presented with a review of the literature, including the therapeutic management, and the possible diagnostic criteria are discussed.	1.2595482712177164
The immunohistochemically determined expression of cytokeratin (CK) 13 implicates the histogenetic origin of the BOC from the squamous epithelium of the oral cavity and excludes the origin from the small salivary glands.	0.9429477481887776
The expression of CK 19 and the lack of expression of p53, as well as the higher proliferation rate of the basal epithelial cell layer by the BOC, may be useful for distinction between the keratocyst.	1.103795184288521
Within the framework of a study on vocational rehabilitation of the mentally ill, we examined 83 schizophrenic outpatients enrolled in a work therapy program.	1.1132685991439661
The course of illness and rehabilitation was documented over a 3-year period by means of annual follow-up examinations.	1.149485820856847
The sample comprised 44 men and 39 women with an average age of 35 years (SD +/- 8,5).	1.031442845288357
The majority were chronically ill patients with a history of frequent and long psychiatric hospitalization.	0.9797726565588952
After 3 years, 22% of the patients were integrated into the general labor market, 26% had sheltered employment, 23% were still in work therapy, and 29% were unemployed.	1.4213398901944014
Besides the patients' subjective expectations, early introduction of rehabilitative measures and a favourable course of illness were found to be predictors of a successful rehabilitation leading to vocational integration.	1.1221182008948989
Outpatient work therapy is a contemporary, effective organizational form of sociotherapy.	1.0036285230128827
It may contribute to improved vocational competence and integration, reduced psychiatric hospitalization and stabilized psychopathology.	0.9246574109353971
Objective: Based on personal observations the neuromuscular blocking potency of atracurium was supposed to be diminished in purulent intrathoracic diseases.	0.9995020932576375
This hypothesis was tested in a prospective clinical trial.	0.9811302587394148
Aim of study: Goal of this survey is to give an overview of anaesthesia for caesarean section in Germany.	1.2621492844268551
Ultrasound contrast agent is used in color Doppler flow imaging for signal enhancement in perfused vessels.	0.8748164001790131
We present our experience with its use in the head and neck area and the results obtained.	1.281646799355598
Up until now, 30 patients with carcinomas of the oral cavity or the maxillary sinus, tumors of the mandible and metastatic or inflammatory lymph nodes have been examined.	1.056437000742658
Conventional B-scan sonography was supplemented by non-contrast color Doppler flow imaging.	0.8150753118208856
Depending on the indication, 2.5 g Levovist in bolus or 4 g fractionated was injected intravenously in a concentration of 300 or 400 mg/ml.	1.01570459209192
The administration of the contrast agent was tolerated by all patients without any side effects and in all cases led to a remarkable enhancement of the Doppler signals.	1.1994871963778682
About 15 to 30 s after injection, an enhancement in perfused vessels was detected.	0.9692082320580572
The fractioned injection of 4 g led to a lengthening of signal enhancement up to more than 10 min and to the possibility of examining more parts with a single application of contrast agent.	1.1220164358941982
In 64% of the lymph nodes, vessels could only be identified with the administration of Levovist.	1.1169926631299312
The general vessel topography could be better evaluated in 83% of the cases.	0.8374894671646649
The lymph-node-supplying vessels were identified in 8 of 11 patients after the injection of contrast media.	1.0948170883882167
Additional information, which was gained in 17 patients, increased the certainty of diagnosis or of the therapeutic concept.	1.395921604206344
In three cases, the examinations with the signal enhancer resulted in a change in therapy.	1.0231295304252273
By applying signal enhancer in color Doppler sonography the fields of examination in the head and neck areas can be expanded.	0.8158041035323449
Non-syndromic neurosensory recessive deafness (NSRD) is one of the most common human sensory disorders.	0.9973817807650227
Mutations in the connexin 26 gene have been established as a major cause of inherited and sporadic non-syndromic deafness in different populations.	1.0046844950066403
Laser-induced thermotherapy is an in situ ablation method for the local treatment of liver tumors.	1.0634703081511612
The basic prerequisite for induction of adequate treatment volumes for clinical use was the development of a thermostable application system.	0.9679280224144611
In an ex vivo test series, the specially developed application system (diffuser tip) with 5760 J had a higher thermic loading capacity than the Ringmode applicator with 4200 J, thus enabling the induction of significantly larger lesions with a volume of 7.6 cm3.	1.0474559573281186
The results of a further in vivo test series demonstrated that the lesions were subject to a four-phase connective-tissue organization within a 6-month period.	1.1530542183355943
Furthermore, the same laser energy (4200 J) was associated with a significantly lower lesion volume of 2.5 cm3 in the in vivo than in the ex vivo test series.	1.1885154908428543
The influence of liver perfusion on the inducible lesion volume was examined in a further animal experimental study.	0.962963063413407
By temporarily interrupting hepatic blood perfusion (Pringle's maneuver) during laser application, the effective volume could be increased to 50.3 cm3 (P < 0.01) using an optical beam splitter.	1.061159482834231
These results show that the technical prerequisites for reliable clinical application of laser-induced thermotherapy have been fulfilled.	0.9809996844397844
A total of 222 urogenital specimens were investigated with a commercially available polymerase chain reaction (Amplicor test) for the direct detection of Chlamydia trachomatis.	1.1088947988220004
The results were compared with those yielded by the conventional cell culture technique.	0.9526196081834597
Using cell culture a urogenital C. trachomatis infection could be detected in 72 of 222 patients.	0.9759630003329823
The Amplicor test yielded a positive result in 83.	0.7497250598138927
Referred to the detection rate of the Amplicor test and that of the cell culture, sensitivity was 91.2% for the test sensitivity and 79.1% for the cell culture.	1.364597392890409
The specificity of both techniques was 100% when the specimens for which neither both nor either one of the tests gave positive results were considered.	1.185088421808109
In accordance with other studies, this study suggests that tests based on nucleic acid amplification will supersede cell cultures as the gold standard for the detection of C. trachomatis and also become the method of choice in routine diagnosis of urogenital chamydial infections.	1.0748056352673439
Incidence and clinical significance of cardiopulmonary complications of acute cerebral lesions are still unclear.	0.9117518343153767
Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is characterized as an acute, protein-rich lung edema occurring shortly after cerebral lesions associated with an acute rise of intracranial pressure.	1.1743476919089635
NPE is infrequently diagnosed, usually in association with head trauma.	0.87709683472514
Pathophysiological mechanisms include a rise of the pulmonary vascular hydrostatic pressure either due to sympathetic innervation with pulmonary vasoconstriction or increased left-atrial pressure following systemic arterial hypertension or an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability.	1.0488668257102691
In contrast to NPE, cardiac complications are frequently observed, most consistently in patients with subarachoid hemorrhage.	1.2353922855651724
Typical ECG changes are repolarization abnormalities, similar to those observed in coronary heart disease, and cardiac arrhythmias.	1.0138928480473217
The CK-MB may be slightly elevated; echocardiographic findings show a depressed left-ventricular function.	0.8253771285431787
Pathological examination reveals myofibrillar necrosis.	0.5016158615587315
Cardiac complications are explained with overactivity of the sympathetic innervation and high levels of circulating catecholamines.	0.9206550414620569
For adequate treatment, close cardiac monitoring is required in all patients with acute cerebral lesions.	1.3199715959345266
Benign, non-parasitic liver cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally by abdominal ultrasound or CT scan.	0.9100109217856178
We present the case of a 68-year-old patient who showed obstructive jaundice due to a hemorrhagic liver cyst compressing the choledochal duct.	0.9465880262863143
Due to the location of the cyst in the porta hepatis with partial compression of central liver vessels and the meanwhile organized hematoma, operative therapy was preferred in order to prevent secondary complications such as portal vein thrombosis and to exclude a malignant neoplasm.	1.121774693505836
This review summarizes briefly pathophysiology, clinical definitions, pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnostic procedures and principles of therapy and prophylaxis of ischemic stroke.	1.0009031265728285
Ischemic stroke is defined as a localized lack of cerebral perfusion mainly due to cardioembolic or arterial-embolic occlusion of cerebral arteries or hemodynamic or microangiographic reduction of cerebral blood flow.	0.9239565030801473
We focused on pathophysiological mechanisms with potential clinical relevance as the role of oxygen and glucose concentration, the therapeutic time window, the role of excitatory neurotransmitters, Ca2+-influx, free radicals, and the development of ischemic brain edema.	1.1310550444527103
Based on this data the need of an urgent initiation of diagnostic workup and therapy is emphasized.	1.0646475473660375
This includes the early basic management with monitoring of blood pressure, ECG, oxygen and blood glucose concentration, and the balance of the water and electrolyte supply.	1.12024906980768
Since specific therapeutic and prophylactic interventions are based on an exact diagnosis with respect to the pathogenesis, the need of an urgent diagnostic workup including clinical examination, laboratory baseline, vascular ultrasound, cranial CT-scan, ECG, and echocardiography is emphazised.	1.1952720551722462
Based on these results appropriate management of certain pathogenetic stroke subgroups is discussed.	0.860308632085068
New data about the effectiveness of basic care, treatment of edema, neuroprotective agents, and thrombolysis is presented.	0.9888160154767585
Indications for the therapy with intravenous heparin, vitamin K-antagonists, antiplatelet drugs, and surgical procedures are summarized.	1.208806122457649
Longitudinal osteocutaneous defects of the sternal region including the caudal third were reconstructed in 15 patients during a 3-year period by using the "vertical (VRAM)- and transverse rectus abdominis muscle" (TRAM) flap.	1.0859698903144102
The majority of the defects resulted from chronic osteomyelitis after previous cardiothoracic surgery or were due to former therapy of breast cancer.	0.9812975297768449
Three VRAM/TRAM flaps were primarily transferred as free flaps with microvascular anastomosis in the axilla region.	0.803939579850773
Nine out of 12 pedicled VRAM or TRAM flaps required an additional microvascular anastomosis because of imminent venous or arterial insufficency ("supercharging").	0.9537176289951262
Therefore, operative technique and operating time of the pedicled and free flap for reconstruction of longitudinal sternal defects are comparable.	1.2673787505742258
Adequate reconstruction and rehabilitation was achieved in 11 cases.	0.9447917464654709
In 2 patients revision and partial secondary defect coverage was required.	0.8206155683645181
Two male patients died postoperatively due to their preexisting condition.	0.8972403812126256
The introduction of joints in unilateral fixators enables these for multiple deformity corrections.	0.7420131404715373
Lengthening and shortening is achieved by changing the length of the fixator telescope.	0.8499242401458081
Axial corrections are performed by additive or subtractive techniques using uniplanar joints or by angulation procedures.	0.8071001458812858
Translation is done by direct movements of the bone fragments or by metaphyseal "double angulation".	1.057570304866456
Derotation preferably is done as an acute procedure or in the "ring part" of a hybrid frame.	1.2012592427337074
Unilateral fixators are used to correct and temporarily stabilize until the correction is held by the nintramedullary nail.	0.8824283815337801
Pathomorphology in the preterm infant represents an interaction of morphological organ immaturity and neonatal management with their respective sequelae.	0.88245967767404
Background: Morphological changes in the corneal surface after PRK may result not only in refraction fluctuations and reduction in visual acuity, but also in changes of contrast sensitivity.	1.2113266122333868
The aim of this study was to investigate whether PRK has an influence on contrast sensitivity with and without glare with a subsequent effect on the ability to drive cars.	0.9576990516574087
Calcifying obliterative atherosclerosis isolated within the descending thoracic aorta causing subtotal vascular occlusion was associated with symptoms such as in aortic coarctation in a 56-year-old patient.	0.8704953676586251
Remarkable in this unique case is the atypical and isolated manifestation of atherosclerotic disease within the thoracic aorta, as well as the tumorous extent of luminal calcification.	1.047156234044975
Differential diagnostic considerations had to include calcifying tumor of the aorta, remnants after aortitis or secondary calcified aortic dissection.	0.9465311334758577
The osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with obliteration of the sinus has been established in the therapy of frontal sinus diseases that can not be drainaged permanently or healed through an endonasal access.	0.9645105198596213
The obliteration of the frontal sinus is endangered in cases of multiple fracturing of the posterior frontal sinus wall or if it has been destroyed by an inflammatory process.	1.0569759529857043
In these problematic cases obliteration bears the danger of complications and cranialization of the frontal sinus is therefore the method of choice.	0.9110916367494718
We review 8 patients who were operated on using the cranialization technique.	0.8488074510738023
Indications for surgery were a combined fracture of the anterior and posterior frontal sinus wall (3), a pyocele of the front sinus with extensive destruction of the posterior wall (4) and a large osteoma of the posterior frontal sinus wall (1).	1.1097564799980972
The frontal sinus was exposed through a coronal incision, the mucosa and the posterior wall were completely removed and the frontal sinus obliterated with fat tissue.	1.164317342388144
The anterior sinus wall was replaced after obliteration of the sinus or reconstructed with calvarian bone transplants.	0.8591759718035096
The follow up period was 1.8 years (11 months to 8 years).	1.1811063605613707
All patients underwent postoperatively a clinical ENT-examination and radiological assessment by CT-scan or MRI.	1.115457529392547
The overall functional and esthetic outcome was excellent.	0.7036894381831043
There were no serious complications nor any recurrence.	1.022983286585427
The cranialization of the frontal sinus is a reliable and safe variation of the classical osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with fat obliteration.	0.9812460687989519
We present the case of an infant with Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, in whom keloids developed at the sites of intracutanous bleeding within 6 months after the illness.	1.086589865403989
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) belongs to the category of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA).	0.8517207041997361
The clinical picture is characterised by progressive ataxia and macular degeneration.	0.7714284709143083
Other common signs are slow saccades, external ophthalmoplegia, and pyramidal tract signs.	0.9723352234976109
The disease is caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat in the gene for ataxin 7 on chromosome 3.	0.9493015577999364
SCA7 is a rare disorder.	1.0648606424063718
The first case in Germany was described only recently.	1.1375929542590089
We report two additional patients, father and son, with the molecular genetic diagnosis of SCA7.	1.2599116185511665
The father carries a trinucleotide expansion of 42 CAG repeats, the son 51.	0.8422553206914324
Normal alleles range from 7 to 35 CAG repeats.	0.7703287622005358
Both patients show the typical picture with progressive ataxia and macular degeneration.	0.7726866669242644
We found a pronounced anticipation (earlier disease onset in subsequent generations), which is highly characteristic of CAG repeat disorders.	1.1684408900751884
In the following contribution the under-proportional participation rate of older workers in vocational training is analysized.	0.9050896805763969
Regarding the changes concerning the organiszation of vocational training to more job-integrated, self-directed and computerbased learning the consequences for training opportunities, motivation to learn and performance possibilities as well as institutional basic conditions to optimize the participation of elderly workers in further training are discussed.	0.9132191826746641
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most severe arbovirus disease transmitted by ticks.	1.0727303864487228
The mortality of the central European form is 0.7-2%.	1.3515837334754093
Active immunisation is recommended for endemic regions.	0.7831923210008152
We report on 4 patients with TBE aquired in Middle-Hessen between 1994 and 1997 (2 in 1997).	1.3107422660240513
After repeated CSF and serum testing the TBE-specific antibodies were found in all 4 cases.	0.9691321193057417
In one case there was also evidence for a prior infection with borrelia burgdorferi.	1.0603957029001259
The results of the initial CSF-analysis were atypical in 2 cases (high cell count of 136 cells/mm3, total protein up to 1.5 g/l).	1.2112412591107056
The endemic region for TBE has expanded in northern direction into Middle-Hessen, a region in which Lyme borreliosis is also endemic.	0.9277831346782823
Thus, true double infections are possible.	1.0453609284065999
This and the initially frequently atypical CSF-findings make the differential diagnosis difficult.	0.9820668370292455
Therefore, repetitive CSF and blood examinations are recommended.	1.2596226212872115
Nedocromil sodium and cromolyn sodium are non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of asthma.	1.0234574678770016
Although they are chemically different, there are many similarities in their mechanism of action.	1.1663465951869574
In provocation tests they have equal efficacy on some tests (allergen, exercise), but nedocromil sodium has greater effect on neuronal mechanisms such as So2 challenge.	0.9848742507078946
Very few studies compared the two drugs.	0.8399450420820151
In children, only one study was done, showing that twice daily nedocromil is as effective as four times daily cromolyn sodium.	1.0018364277579652
Thus twice daily administration is one advantage of nedocromil, the other being proven effect of steroid- sparing, which has not been shown with cromolyn sodium.	1.1467762550587413
Both drugs are recommended as first-line agents in mild persistent asthma.	0.9597022314744849
Background: We evaluated in this retrospective study the impact of our diagnostic and therapeutic regimens - as illustrated by typical clinical pictures - on the frequency and prognostic values of postkeratoplasty complications in herpes eyes.	1.3217282860900663
The evaluation of brain tumor recurrence and therapy-induced benign changes following surgery and/or irradiation is a diagnostic challenge for imaging methods based on either morphology (cCT/MRI) or function (SPECT/PET).	1.122977110710563
Current literature and the present data of our own patients demonstrate the diagnostic efficiency of IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET in the detection of recurrence and in-vivo grading.	0.9961656576542328
Thirty-nine patients suspected of brain tumor recurrence at follow-up were studied by FDG-PET and IMT-SPECT.	1.066331791282794
Thirty-four of 39 patients showed recurrences; in 12 cases even a change in the grade of malignancy was observed.	1.0066095785394071
All high-grade recurrences could be confirmed by either methods.	0.9913765411938064
IMT-SPECT showed a higher sensitivity in detecting low-grade tumors at recurrence.	1.0112994853951056
In contrast to IMT-SPECT, FDG-PET supports sufficient in-vivo grading.	0.9357918387607607
Both methods can be used to differentiate between tumor recurrence and radionecrosis.	0.9731472227696363
In conclusion the results of our study demonstrate the efficiency of IMT-SPECT and FDG-PET in confirming recurrences and determining the actual tumor grade.	1.012915096874788
A 22-year-old male presented with a submandibular cystic mass in the ENT Clinic of Berlin-Buch.	1.1541833450907648
Histopathology revealed a dystopic papillary carcinoma in a thyroglossal duct cyst.	0.7573413660890038
Worldwide only about 150 cases are known.	0.7155302792160636
We describe our diagnostic and therapeutic procedures employed and included tumor excision, bilateral neck dissections and total thyroidectomy.	1.0003485036207378
No abnormalities in the thyroid gland but a metastatic carcinoma was uncovered in an ipsilateral lymph node in the jugular foramen area.	0.963233134474173
A preoperative 99 Tc-thyroid scan and MRI study had not shown any evidence for a malignant tumor.	0.8925000473872824
The therapeutic approach advocated in literature is controversial but the intraoperative findings in our patient supported our decision to choose a relatively radical but not mutilating therapy.	1.0234251266518866
Transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) is a pleiotrophic growth factor in carcinogenesis and regulars multiple cell functions.	1.0171020621304192
We wanted to evaluate the diagnostic meaning of TGF-1 plasma levels in patients with a biopsy proven prostate cancer.	1.095761153328577
The TGF-1 blood level was analysed in 394 patients.	0.8252788916477689
In 242 patients (group I) the blood was taken before any prostate manipulation and biopsy.	1.1288812963683672
The TGF-1 plasma concentrations were almost similar in the group of patients with a prostate cancer (n = 157) and patients with a benign prostate hyperplasia (n = 85; 14 258 pg/ml versus 14 658 pg/ml, SD 10 516 pg/ml).	1.194617231902512
In 152 patients the blood was taken 6-12 months after radical prostatectomy (group II).	1.031190856887165
There was no significant difference between the patients with a PSA-progress and without PSA-progress after.	1.077332187788159
Our results suggest that TGF-1 plasma levels can not be used to distinguish between patients with prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia.	1.0502535582891164
The aim of this study was to compare the psychological stress of patients with different forms of immediate type hypersensitivity and urticaria.	0.962247197636657
Moreover, the patients' motivation for different forms of psychological treatment was assessed and an indication for psychosocial support was defined.	1.2268211561622941
228 consecutive inpatients with insect venom allergies (ins), food intolerance (food), drug hypersensitivities (dru) and urticaria (urt) were evaluated by validated questionnaires regarding psychological strain and motivation for psychosocial treatments.	1.2459263892032981
Patients with food intolerance and urticaria showed significantly elevated psychological stress and higher motivation for psychosocial support as compared to those with insect venom allergies and drug intolerance.	0.9835078129983358
Patient education was the favourite technique for the patients (food 78%, urt 57%, dru 24%, ins 17%), followed by relaxation treatment.	1.300783472675293
The most important predictors for the motivation were the wish for self-responsibility, a feeling of helplessness and social limitations.	0.9782853261004508
If strong indication criteria are applied, psychosocial support is indicated in only small subgroups of each patient group.	1.0185882078805732
In spite of that, the management of allergic disease should consider the potential need for psychosocial support.	1.0931870747247363
The definition of endocrine disrupters is not very sharp.	0.8253377162707247
At present all non-physiologic substances which bind to steroid receptors, are defined as endocrine disrupters of which the best studied are estrogenic in nature.	0.9121685941076629
Many pesticides or insecticides or their metabolites have estrogenic activity and pollute our surface water.	0.706348819344238
Here they may cause severe estrogenization of aquatic life.	0.7837208243490296
Only traces of these substances are demonstrable in drinking water.	0.8226019109123129
On the other hand, weak estrogens present in plastic ware may be ingested by men and therefore be potentially harmful for human health.	0.8069607437980874
On the other hand, many plants produce socalled'hyto-estrogens', particularly soy products are rich in phyto-estrogens but their high consumption in Asian populations are most likely the reason for reduced occurrence of breast cancer.	0.9477229427178792
Many plant extracts used for human medication also contain phyto-estrogens and are beneficial in the treatment of climacteric complaints.	0.8457874706708194
Hence, not all endocrine disruptors must be harmful to human health, in fact, some of them (clearly phyto-estrogens) may have beneficial effects.	1.1270569600801685
Germany's new Protection against infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz) will take effect on January 1, 2001.	0.9099606475346192
It will result in an increase of notifications on reportable infections.	0.815234873809299
Counties and states have to adjust the infrastructure of their reportable disease notification systems to meet the demands of the new legislation.	0.9014726197668451
An increased demand for human resources at the non-medical staff level is anticipated.	0.9003824918947514
Continuing education programs for medical and non-medical staff at public health offices are mandatory.	0.8516724685992848
Physicians in private practice, hospitals and diagnostic laboratories and leaders of nursing homes are target groups for special information.	0.8428101164550882
A timely review and epidemiological evaluation of all notifications forwarded by county health offices has to be performed at the state level.This is a prerogative for immediate response in case of non-localized increases in reported disease incidence.	1.0790835401633874
The author advocates the development of an epidemiological rapid reaction scheme (epidemiological fire brigade) in which public health physicians at the county, state, and federal level cooperate in a gradual response to outbreak situations according to actual demand.	1.1080224953110156
We report on an 8 year old boy and a 12 year old girl with intermittent peranal loss of blood and mucus, impaired defecation and recurrent abdominal pain.	1.2152352461824714
On endoscopy isolated ulcers were seen in the rectum only, whereas the colonic mucosa appeared to be normal macroscopically and microscopically.	1.0052672292814249
Biopsies from the borders of the ulcers revealed a hyperplasia of the lamina muscularis mucosae and a fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria mucosae.	0.9338445539368297
These clinical, endoscopical and histological findings are characteristic for the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.	0.8752109828933284
Only 26 paediatric cases (age at diagnosis 6-9 years) have been published so far.	1.2297945879876189
The interval from first symptoms to final diagnosis (mean: 3,7 years, range: 1 week to 9 years) is remarkably long in childhood cases.	1.3187585748087507
Pathogenetically an internal rectal prolapse with secondary ischemic lesions is assumed.	0.7487176223620681
There is no evidence of an association to inflammatory bowel disease.	1.036674570593877
The ulcers ars often resistant to different medical and surgical options.	0.8061325418295705
Discussion: Pediatricians should be aware of the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome in order to make an earlier diagnosis and to prevent unnecessary diagnostic procedures and concerns of patients and their parents about more severe illnesses.	1.1422215196569734
A typology of chronic illness in childhood and adolescence is developed.	0.8205672784996572
In a comparative analysis of 29 studies, maximal androgen deprivation (MAD) was not found to be superior to partial androgen deprivation.	1.1162850011236036
Thus, MAD cannot be regarded as the new gold standard.	1.1868181682331949
Most trials focus on quality of life which - given the palliative aim of the treatment - deserves special attention.	1.3932334849810368
This aspect has not yet been evaluated, however, in the largest multicenter study, Intergroup study 0105.	1.1660123595155096
In patients with advanced bone metastasis or severe pain, MAD treatment should be begun because of the flare phenomenon.	1.0512020526532986
The synergistic effects of LHRH agonists on the prostate are currently being investigated.	0.787379710050905
Since no clear prognostic factors exist and reduction of serum-PSA levels under MAD does not delay progression, the patient must help to make the decision of whether or not MAD should be begun.	1.0740248500744471
A case of generalized maculopapular rash and local indurated plaques following s.c. injections of either low-molecular-weight heparin or conventional (high-molecular-weight) heparin to a 75-year-old woman is reported.	1.0094527366482788
This rare reaction is described and the literature to date is reviewed.	1.2143266719051842
Perioperative morbidity and mortality in noncardiac surgery are mainly due to cardiovascular complications.	0.7886278042782279
Therefore, perioperative risk assessment is crucial to avoid these adverse events.	1.3333181534897602
In patients above the age of 40 years, the ECG is a basic investigation, often providing hints for cardiovascular diseases.	1.1855836546600618
Stress testing and, in special cases, stress echocardiography or scintigraphy (the latter only in those patients, in which exercise is impossible) can detect significant coronary artery disease.	1.2544492761583406
The vascularization reduced the perioperative risk in particular in those patients with unstable angina or severe coronary artery disease.	1.0833092670421267
However, prophylactic revascularization the stable patient does not improve overall outcome, because the risk of the revascularizing procedure must be added to the risk of noncardiac surgery.	1.1757843558854388
Other diagnostic procedures like echocardiography, chest roentgenogram, routine scintigraphy, halter ECG or halter blood pressure measurement do not add information to the perioperative risk assessment, although these techniques might be very relevant in evaluating other coexisting diseases (heart failure; valve lesions, in particular aortic stenoses etc.)	1.100864585018141
and can be useful to improve medical treatment preoperatively (e.g.	0.715388756201578
normalization of blood pressure).	0.7309937572073341
A verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old woman who had been suffering from interstitial cystitis with Hunner's ulcer for 10 years.	0.9276016153738548
Up to now, only 7 cases of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder unassociated with bilharzial cystitis have been reported.	0.999049079796424
Although the development of a verrucous carcinoma as a complication of interstitial cystitis has not been reported so far, the authors regard the chronic irritation of the bladder to be the most important etiologic factor for the malignant transformation.	1.2150177503719384
After conservative management had failed, a radical cystectomy with supravesical urinary diversion was performed.	0.8709628488239755
The characteristics of interstitial cystitis, verrucous carcinoma and surgical management are discussed.	0.8119315652956097
Introduction: Abdominal actinomycosis is an uncommon disease.	1.3405944884769894
Nevertheless it should be considered in case of unclear tumor-like abdominal masses.	1.1441081035818186
Methods: We report a case of a 49-year-old patient with an intrauterine device.	1.2650058474478283
The patient was submitted with a solid and painful tumor in the upper abdomen.	1.089359329340824
After sonography, computerized tomography, gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy the preoperative presumptive diagnosis was a carcinoma of the transvers colon invading the abdominal wall.	0.8844821096000289
Pathological examination after a right hemicolectomy surprisingly revealed an actinomycosis.	0.7766576000006549
Results: Based on this case diagnostic tools and therapeutic options of actinomycosis of the colon are discussed.	1.3093202203346672
Conclusions: This case illustrates the importance to consider the possibility of actinomycosis when finding an unclear abdominal mass.	1.0873878331228597
After a surgical excision an abdominal actinomycosis requires antibiotic therapy.	0.7502420802878813
Long-term treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenias requires integration of many therapeutic approaches, co-operation of several professions, and regard for the views of patients and relatives.	1.1812450048452052
This review deals with practical aspects of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, cognitive resp.	0.9009808470077862
psychological treatments, social resp.	0.8813806232171225
milieu therapy, rehabilitation, interventions based on the concept of Expressed Emotions (EE), psychoeducation and work with relatives.	0.9979765118386325
Continuous neuroleptic treatment is indispensable in most cases to achieve social integration.	0.940513147968858
Indications for adding on antidepressants, lithium, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines and other drugs are discussed, as well as treatment of negative symptoms, depression and management of treatment-resistant symptoms.	0.9756049041174205
Psychotherapy needs to regard the possibilities of the patient.	0.8723328776421109
In the context of a stable long-term relationship, the patient is supported in experiencing himself as a subject capable of action.	1.2511667476485682
Effectiveness of cognitive treatments to date is limited.	0.7745963397738334
The best results are achieved by social skills training.	0.869577444919908
Social therapy, which aims at the improvement of functional aspects of the patient, is of paramount importance.	1.194074049303598
Improved possibilities for work rehabilitation are contrasted by difficulties in financing long-term social rehabilitation.	0.8861018061132658
Interventions based on the EE concept are highly effective, but are rarely used.	1.0419455579764156
Programs that merely convey information without targeting behaviour modification are ineffective.	0.6388557650661523
The functions of facilities of treatment in the community are explained, the integrative role of case-management is stressed.	1.1636239605062664
The effect of a locally applied peppermint oil preparation on tension-type headache was examined in the design of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study for the first time.	0.9102257581468367
The preparation was tested against both the reference substance acetaminophen and to the corresponding placebo.	1.088881972221992
The liquid test preparation contained 10 g of peppermint oil and ethanol (90 %) ad 100 (test preparation LI 170, Lichtwer Pharma, Berlin); the placebo was a 90 % ethanol solution to which traces of peppermint oil were added for blinding purposes.	1.0883058950902866
The reference preparation contained 500 mg acetaminophen; the placebo tablet was identical to the verum in size and appearance.	0.9196793817722679
The study included the analysis of 164 headache attacks of 41 patients of both sexes ranging between 18 and 65 years of age, suffering from tension-type headache in accordance with the IHS classification.	1.0432943152639214
Four headache episodes per patient were treated in a double-blind, randomized crossover design.	0.8738658383099036
Each headache attack was treated by the application of 2 capsules of the oral medication (1000 mg of acetaminophen or placebo) and the cutaneous application of the oil preparation (peppermint oil or placebo solution).	1.1895347275248314
The oil was spread largely across forehead and temples which was repeated after 15 and 30 minutes.	0.8283306113516702
Using a headache diary, the headache parameters were assessed after 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes.	1.1240065358385856
Compared to the application of placebo, a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution significantly reduced the clinical headache intensity already after 15 minutes (p < 0.01).	0.8894966452575817
This significant clinical reduction of the pain intensity continued over the one hour observation period.	0.9929511378606222
Acetaminophen, too, proved to be efficient compared to placebo (p < 0.01).	0.7908899828288356
There was no significant difference between the efficacy of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution.	0.7521561661549979
Simultaneous application of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution leads to an additive effect which remains below the significance threshold, however.	0.9094508268094967
The patients reported no adverse events.	0.7176840969615383
This controlled study showed for the first time that a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution efficiently alleviates tension-type headache.	0.980989606582503
Peppermint oil thus proves to be a well-tolerated and cost-effective alternative to usual therapies.	0.9947841996028339
The positive results of several multi-center studies significantly improved the immunomodulatory treatment of multiple sclerosis over the last few years.	0.9933043407980774
It was demonstrated that different compounds are capable to reduce the number of relapses and to modulate the progression of disease.	0.8999833405906876
To improve the transition of results obtained in these studies into daily clinical practice, a consensus group started to prepare a report on the current treatment options for the German-speaking European countries.	1.217567554479206
The aim of this paper is to summarize the current knowledge, compare the results of recent clinical trials with the experience from other  therapeutic options and assess their clinical evidence.	1.2608037432318433
Dislocated metacarpal V fractures, fixed by percutaneous Kirschner wires or other implants near the metacarpophalangeal joint, often show impaired movement despite excellent radiologic findings.	0.9018664725039085
We therefore chose an alternative method using intramedullary Kirschner wire osteosynthesis according to Foucher.	0.7768881852967101
Twenty-five patients were operated on in a 3-year period and movement of the fingers and complications were examined.	1.1115924382931446
Six weeks after operation all fractures were consolidated in anatomical reduction.	0.9935944538368702
One patient suffering from an early stage of Sudeck's dystrophy was healed, and no other complications appeared.	1.1404419114356605
Three months after treatment all patients achieved free movement of the fingers with anatomical alignment.	1.0797774988714335
We therefore recommend intramedullary Kirschner wire osteosynthesis in distal metacarpal V fractures.	0.7832500847622208
Aspiration of toxic substances, foreign material, bacterially contaminated secretions, or water (near-drowning) either immediately leads to cessation of respiration or to impaired ventilation due to airway obstruction, it causes hypoxia due to surfactant dysfunction, and pulmonary infection might develop.	1.0159650335991643
Respiratory insufficiency is the resulting consequence which needs immediate and appropriate therapy and intervention.	0.8333406645613102
The knowledge of risk factors that promote aspiration injury is important for its prevention and limitation.	1.0270536806922754
Mortality varies between 3 and 70% depending on patients studied, and on the nature and amount of aspirated material.	1.022109205699117
The major cause of death is acute respiratory failure.	0.7629715142600262
The onset of injury to the lung after aspiration is very rapid.	0.8942827173056958
Therefore, therapeutic interventions like bronchoscopy are often too late.	1.2258823829026906
More importantly, oxygenation should be monitored continuously for timely institution of mechanical ventilation.	0.852358100694081
Antibiotics should not be given routinely but a calculated regime is neccessary when signs of infection develop.	0.9239247523796238
Prognosis in near-drowning considerably depends on early rescue and successful resuscitation.	0.7768246784391507
A rapid onset of cerebral hypothermia during the accident can help to increase the ischemic tolerance of the brain and makes it neccessary to continue advanced life support until rewarming of the near-drowning victim.	1.0275134374933848
Anticipation of individual outcome in unconscious patients is difficult.	0.834884385603322
One third of them survive with a moderate to severe neurologic damage.	0.8885429559969052
The overall mortality of near-drowning is about 11%.	0.8339722905608793
Pathophysiological aspects, diagnostic procedures, pratical management and possible prophylaxis of aspiration injuries will be discussed.	0.8993429669696763
Background: Semiquantitative classification of corneal topography after penetrating keratoplasty has the potential for focusing information about the areal dioptric power of the cornea.	1.1386806578098367
The purpose of this study was to objectify the procedure of manual semiquantitative classification using a Fourier transform of corneal topography power data and to correlate both methods.	0.9655931336864603
Recently, professional anaesthesiologists organizations, have set up recommendations for intraoperative monitoring.	1.1941774299710497
These recommendations are based upon the assumption that anaesthesia-related deaths are largely preventable and that extensive monitoring will reduce mortality.	0.9166274104570986
Hypoxaemia appears to be an important pathophysiological mechanism, and this is why oxygen monitoring is given a high priority in safety standards in anaesthesia.	1.1403928492675373
However, no reduction in mortality has been definitively shown to follow the use of any monitoring device in randomized, controlled trials.	1.2983953915257194
Four techniques of oxygen monitoring are discussed and evaluated.	0.9383375414312505
Oxygen monitoring during inspiration can be recommended, although its implementation will probably prevent only a few anaesthesia-related deaths.	1.1108891235558933
Pulse oximetry is certainly highly recommended, but also has some deficiencies which are not sufficiently well known considering the popularity of this technique.	1.1838464239777697
Transcutaneous PO2 is considered mainly for historical reasons.	0.6605710134177967
Near infrared spectrometry is a new technique offering noninvasive and continuous monitoring of intracerebral oxygenation.	1.0360721008406524
The increasing frequency of stent implantation into coronary arteries is based mainly on assumptions.	0.9291784257681495
One of these assumptions is that stents may prevent restenosis.	0.9145965772630937
Stents can prevent restenosis as has been shown in two randomized studies (Stress I and Benestent I), but only in large (> 3.0mm) vessels with short denovo lesions.	1.2353894510064733
Despite the very tight selection of patients suitable for stent implantation in these two studies, the advantage for stents remained small (about 10% less restenosis) and appeared to decrease with time following intervention.	1.12232369581853
There is increasing concern about the extension of stenting in an "unrestricted strategy".	0.9128882405919517
This concern was expressed in the ACC Expert Consensus Document which was published recently (JACC 28, No 3, September 1996: 782-794.	0.9733165432566651
Based on the lack of data for most of the presently used stent indications the expert group recommended a more selective strategy for the implantation of stents into coronary arteries.	1.0279025137147557
Removal of the arterial sheath immediately after PTCA is desirable for patients, reduces the medical staff's workload, and may decrease hospital costs due to a shortened length of stay.	1.1374629149322382
Although the safety and efficacy of the hemostatic systems used especially for the above purpose have been sufficiently documented, inadvertent intraluminal vascular occlusion is theoretically possible.	0.9261817959006623
While partial or complete arterial occlusion in conjunction with the VasoSeal collagen prototype device has been previously reported, similar complications occurring with the Angio-SealTM device were not published.	0.9414838099856455
In this report, we describe a 54-year old female patient (height: 150 cm, weight: 42.5 kg) who was transferred for PTCA following an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction.	1.1709524718948527
Immediately after PTCA, the Angio-SealTM device was deployed utilizing standard technique.	0.8670555954717811
No difficulties were encountered during device deployment, however, immediately following device placement active arterial bleeding occurred.	1.002703502817894
Due to the inadequacy of hemostasis, heparin was reversed with protamine to avoid further hemorrhagic complications.	0.835661672931363
Following this, the desired hemostasis quickly occurred, but the patient soon complained about symptoms suggestive of an acute occlusion of the right femoral artery.	1.2704674032842125
Unsatisfactory attempts as lysis resulted in the patient being transferred to vascular surgery.	0.9562950221078823
The complete Angio-SealTM system (anchor including collagen) was located intravasculary, and removed during surgery.	1.0264943604365484
Deviations in the axes can be physiological or pathological.	0.7361924369415269
During growth, the axes of the lower extremities undergo significant changes.	1.0521289084535204
The femoral neck-shaft-angle decreases from 150 ° on average at birth to 120 ° on average at the end of growth.	1.0518280058865654
The lower leg is bowed in a varus direction at birth.	0.8608546512010365
On the basis of an extensive literature search (DIMDI, MEDLINE - status at June 1992), the causes of contact urticaria so far known are displayed in tables.	1.107699671181472
The contact urticariogens can be divided into (1) chemically defined substances and (2) chemically undefined biological materials.	1.0278726375018887
The causes most frequently encountered in 16 professions are given.	0.8039413404655431
Numerous agents are known for medical professions (physicians, nurses, dentists and dental technicians, veterinary surgeons).	0.8367845456025811
Today, the most frequent single cause of contact urticaria is probably the presence of latex proteins in rubber (gloves, condoms, tubes, balloons, etc.).	0.9881634335957695
When testing is performed a stepwise approach is recommended for safety reasons (rub test, prick test, scratch chamber test).	0.8991107472774221
For some contact urticariogens a commercial radioallergosorbent test (RAST) is available.	0.8522542953771174
In the cases reported in the literature it is not always possible to decide definitely whether the pathogenetic mechanism was immunologic (IgE mediated) or non-immunologic (toxic or pseudoallergic).	1.0419916811824521
When there is a high degree of sensitization (e.g.	0.7685644684374034
to latex) professional activities must be severely restricted, or even completely discontinued in rare cases.	0.9566981857626203
Purpose: To find and describe potential MRI criteria of nutrient vessel canals of carpal bones.	0.8773994206579725
2-Agonists are being used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine because of their antihypertensive, analgesic and sedative properties.	1.0695994601926977
Platelets bear 2-receptors on the cell surface.	0.8171896433984724
Stimulation of these receptors by agonists induces platelet aggregation.	0.8225062050025167
The present study examined whether in vitro incubation of blood with the 2-agonists clonidine and dexmedetomidine decreases 2-receptor density and hereby influences platelet aggregation.	1.1069917936770717
Prehospital diagnosis and first line therapy of acute chest pain are among the most frequently encountered challenges for general practitioners and emergency physicians.	1.102029574025557
Acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes in general are present in about a third of patients complaining of acute chest pain.	0.980797708399465
The basis of first line therapy is the understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia, the clinical symptoms, the diagnostic tools and the preclinically available therapeutic options.	1.293325410687141
Time is the most critical factor in myocardial ischemia and subsequent infarction with irreversible injury of subendocardial cells starting within 30-60 minutes of total myocardial ischemia and with transmural infarction becoming complete in 3 to 6 hours.	1.0792771244516017
With 30% of patients dying within the first hour of ischemia mostly due to ventricular arrhyhtmias every effort needs to be made to shorten the delay between symptom onset and start of reperfusion therapy.	1.1121193185845142
The present overview concentrates on the armamentarium of preclincial diagnosis and the options of first line therapy of myocardial infarction with the aim of a short transport time to the hospital and therefore a short delay to more specific therapies like thrombolysis or PTCA.	1.1993264554801901
The aim of surgical intervention in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is the achievement of normocalcemia and euparathyreosis.	1.2556217774414709
Despite improved diagnostic procedures containing comparatively modified pre- and intraoperative methods to determine the position of the parathyroid glands and the most efficient operative technique including minimal-invasive surgery thereof, success cannot be guaranteed.	1.0252629126157118
Therefore, we should strive to avoid reintervention by ensuring a hemorrhage-free, atraumatic, anatomical-orientated operation and providing positive preconditions for reoperation.	1.0948551442206158
Success is based on the four pillars of the HPT surgery: history, embryology with anatomy, neck surgery and experience.	0.8732890297194917
By means of this principle and the results of surgical treatment in 1634 patients with pHPT from 1982 until 1998, we demonstrate a standardized operative technique of pHPT.	1.1056804666549442
A 67-year-old male patient presented with a nephrotic syndrome.	0.8515021272177925
Biopsy of the kidney revealed the characteristic of fibrillary glo-merulopathy on light and electron micros-copy.	0.8768039219437135
Other non-nephritic causes of a nephrotic syndrome (e.g.	0.5617202637809215
amyloidosis, immunotactoid glomerulopathy, light-chain glomerulopathy, cryoglobulinaemia, collagen-III glomerulopathy, fibronectin glomerulopathy) could be excluded.	0.9066156548225113
Besides the case report, differential diagnosis of fibrillary glomerulopathies is presented.	1.0761662610196097
Two patients were infected with sporotrichosis; one had the fixed cutaneous form, the other the lymphocutaneous form.	1.1394825621144107
Sporotrichosis schenckii was identified in both with a culture from a tissue biopsy.	0.8665123092189729
Both patients were successfully treated with itraconazole, one received 100 mg and the other 200 mg itraconazole daily over a 3 months period.	1.1404221130742374
Abstract   Mitoxantrone is an anthracenedione antineoplastic agent that has recently been shown to be effective in ameliorating disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS) as indicated by clinical and MRI data.	1.032673296832891
However, the role of mitoxantrone in escalating treatment of patients with frequent and severe relapses and with rapid progression of disability is less clear.	0.9737191917874052
In this retrospective analysis we report on 15 patients with severe relapsing-remitting (9 patients) and secondary progressive MS with superimposed exacerbations (6 patients) treated openlabeled with mitoxantrone in our Clinical Research Group from July 1994 to October 1998.	1.3451705269810805
Eleven of these patients (73%) were treated with azathioprine, interferon-beta-1b or cyclophosphamide before.	1.0673319054857784
The patients received mitoxantrone over a period of at least 12 months (19 +/- 6 months) with a single dose of 10 mg/m2 monthly for the first three months.	1.3642061385018178
Thereafter, infusions were repeated every 3 months (total dose 141 mg +/- 45 mg).	0.9461815964757228
The annual relapse rate could be significantly reduced from 3,0 +/- 1,5 in the year before therapy to 0,5 +/- 0,5 during therapy.	1.1231333871430758
Nine patients (60%) were stabilised, while four patients (27%) showed an improvement of disability.	1.3904784778413022
The treatment was well tolerated with only minor side effects.	0.7966579301736548
These results although retrospectively obtained confirm previous trials showing that mitoxantrone may be useful in MS patients with frequent and severe exacerbations and/or a rapidly progressive course of the disease who have had other immunomodulatory medication.	1.0637002166265803
Interstitial cystitis (IC) represents a rare and complex inflammatory bladder condition in which diagnostics can be challenging.	0.8947798203860328
Strict NIH criteria for its diagnosis were designed for research purposes.	0.7879468108371454
Their routine application would miss large proportions of IC patients.	0.7078997432310941
When IC is suspected, history and physical exam are followed by an evaluation of long-term voiding diaries.	1.026419013336042
Large voided volumes (functional capacity >250 cc) or longer micturition intervals (>2 h.), absence of nocturia or symptom-free periods reduce the likelihood of IC.	1.170178967727555
Further exclusion diagnostics include urine tests (infection), cytology (in-situ carcinoma), ultrasound (calculi, bulks, anomalies) and urodynamics in selected cases.	1.1731155942884546
Bladder capacity measurements under sedoanalgesia are of limited value, since functional low-volume bladders can be mechanically extendable.	0.8821523574909524
Cystoscopy under general anesthesia represents the diagnostic standard procedure for IC during which 90% of IC-patients present with characteristic mucosal glomerulations after bladder distension.	1.0485035096978688
Biopsies are recommended for exclusion of malignancy.	0.7848707115251918
Potassium-leak testing plays no relevant role in routine diagnostics due to its poor sensitivity.	0.863820144129904
Similarly, complex determinations of novel IC markers (histamine, tryptase, cytokines, growth factors, substance P, nitric oxide) are of no relevance in clinical settings and should be restricted to research projects.	1.008546007517215
According to semiotics, which may be defined as the doctrine of the essential nature and fundamental varieties of signs, objects, and interpretants, pain is considered to be a sign (significant) with very different meanings (significance) either as a naturalistic symptom (of disease) or as a symbol used in a metaphorical context.	1.1916695483689155
When following this methodological perspective it is possible to interpret medical as well as poetic writings on equal terms.	0.9484740016775947
In Graeco-Roman medical texts pain was mostly understood as a result and an indicator of disease, but nonetheless as a symptom which seemed to be actively produced by the affected body.	1.1108549034590778
Especially in the Corpus Hippocraticum dating from the 5th and 4th century B. C. this materialistic and at the same time psychosomatic attitude can be noticed.	0.9013865386356963
Aristotle (4th century B. C.), Celsus (1st century A. D.), and the famous experimental physiologist Galen (2nd century A. D.) agreed that pain was a sign of evil which should be fought without exception.	1.0148048702455337
It was Galen who added the disturbance of function (functio laesa) as the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well-known cardinal signs of Celsus (rubor, calor, tumor, dolor).	1.0220702562499446
He also coined the term µK to characterize an attack of migraine.	0.6938613178944115
In algotherapy, Galen used a complex pharmacological system which was based upon the four cardinal qualities of humoral pathology.	0.9208753294885568
On the other hand, pain was designed as a multi-dimensional symbol by the famous Graeco-Roman epic poets.	0.8933273216512023
In Homer's Odyssey (8th century B. C.), pain appears transformed into the shape of a scar which is visible and palpable on the hero's leg like an identification tag, whereas in Virgil's Aeneids (1st century B. C.) pain symbolizes weakness and defencelessness which can only be alleviated by the goddess Venus.	0.9878082446320697
In this article current indications and limitations of neuromuscular monitoring are reviewed.	1.0255274931748766
Attention is mainly focused on detection of residual curarisation.	0.718987057099963
New insights in the pathophysiological consequences of residual neuromuscular blockade and the actual criteria of complete recovery are discussed.	1.0133556246244644
Surprisingly in this context, despite the benefit of neuromuscular monitoring, its utilisation in clinical practice is rather an exception than the routine.	1.096269498019679
A lack of standardisation of neuromuscular monitoring is probably the major problem on the way to a widespread utilisation of the monitoring.	1.0169151320879242
Three patients presented with an acquired green discoloration of their scalp hair.	0.8377628368210546
History revealed that all of them swam regularly in private swimming pools.	0.7742013984513778
Examination of the hair by atomic emission spectroscopy showed that the green discoloration was caused by an excessively high copper content of the hair.	1.02819401985873
This exogeneous discoloration is characteristically related to the uptake of copper from private swimming pools.	0.7422901504696193
A 62-year-old female patient presented with bullous, intensely itching cutaneous lesions, which clinically and histopathologically resembled dermatitis herpetiformis (Duhring's disease).	0.9137878490445754
Therapy with DADPS was unsuccessful.	0.46717912039889625
Because of associated cervical lymph node enlargement and splenomegaly, a lymph node biopsy was taken.	0.9167059404095634
Histopathology of a lymph node and of the bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis: angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD)-type T-cell lymphoma.	1.0935778373341574
Intensely pruritic associated skin eruptions are typical for this peculiar kind of lymphoma.	0.6953468738016593
These skin lesions are due to inflammatory cells and not to neoplastic infiltrations.	0.8444539808694281
This case report is the first report of AILD with bullous skin lesions to appear in the literature.	1.014915685563
Background: The procedures for prophylaxis and treatment of keratopathy following facial palsy with lagophthalmos are unsatisfying from the functional point of view.	0.9413384099902022
The purpose of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of a 0.2-T MRI unit and a 1.0-T MRI unit in the evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament in patients with clinically suspected lesions of this ligament.	1.0556672685011532
Twenty four patients with clinically suspected lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament underwent MRI of the knee on both 0.2-T and 1.0-T MRI units.	1.1845668377466652
Three independent observers evaluated the examinations for primary and secondary signs of a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament.	0.8546858272398594
Frequency of these signs was determined for both modalities, and observer agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic.	1.0962033867549386
Sixteen of 24 patients had signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament on the 1.0-T unit; the 0.2-T unit detected primary signs in 15/16 (93 %) patients and secondary signs in 7/12 (43 %) patients.	1.1174139351094632
In 8 patients the 1.0 T unit showed neither primary nor secondary signs for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament; in these patients the 0.2-T unit detected primary signs in 1/8 cases (12 %), and secondary signs in 3/8 cases (37 %).	1.047510582667588
Observer agreement was very good for the 1.0-T unit and fair for the 0.2-T unit.	0.9182591293842347
There is no substantial difference between 1.0-T units and 0.2-T MRI units in the visualisation of primary signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament.	1.0231455711166055
In the visualisation of secondary signs, 1.0-T units are superior to 0.2-T units, and there is a surprisingly high rate of false-positive results with the 0.2-T unit.	1.220603220594193
As to the reproducibility of the results, the 1.0-T unit is far superior to the 0.2-T unit.	1.0692137159422133
Purpose of our study was to develop a reliable model to define clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) being at low risk and at high risk for occult retroperitoneal metastases based on pathohistological and immunohistochemical parameters in order to stratify the therapeutic approach.	1.038506989871413
3-5 paraffin-embedded formalin fixed tissue blocks of 149 clinical stage I NSGCT were available from all patients and were analyzed for histopathological features associated with pathological stage: presence/absence of vascular invasion, presence/absence of tunical invasion, percentage of each histological cell type present in the primary tumor.	1.071402063346865
Immunohistochemical expression of MIB-1, p53, bcl-2, cathepsin D and e-cadherin was evaluated using a semiquantitative scoring ystem.	0.7689429217485919
Statistical analysis was performed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.	0.8938788535559139
Percentage of embryonal carcinoma [%EC (p < 0.001)] and presence of vascular invasion [VI (p < 0.0001)] were the most significant independent risk factors associated with pathological stage II disease.	1.1161694957063126
Combination of %EC and VI allowed correct prediction of final pathological stage in 88 % of patients.	1.0136264015177685
Cut-off values including both variables identified correct pathological stage in 131/149 patients (88 %).	0.8384996216653318
Less than 45 % EC and absence of VI correctly identified pathological stage I disease in 91.5 %; more than 80 % EC and presence of VI correctly predicted pathological stage II in 88 % of the patients.	1.1089150107496084
%EC and presence/absence of VI appear to be reliable prognosticators to identify both patients at high risk and at low risk for occult retroperitoneal disease.	1.0278468487389623
P53, bcl-2, MIB-1, cathepsin D and e-cadherin did not appear to be of prognostic value in clinical stage I NSGCT.	0.8024034629384235
In the framework of rheumatic illnesses, the lungs and pleura are often observed to be involved.	1.1184227431302336
Dependent on the basic illness in question, conditions of the bronchoalveolar system, vessels, lymphatic system, and pleura that have developed differently inter- and intraindividually can be diagnosed in toporegionally variable forms and combinations.	1.0855023862649509
In the causal pathogenesis, the initial (auto-)immunological alteration of the alveolar septa plays a role.	1.2186986597281206
When the monocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts are activated, as a result of a chronic inflammatory process there is increasing reparative proliferation, which finally leads to the nonspecific end stage of irreversible interstitial fibrosis.	1.2134499940362038
The incidence and manifestation forms of lung changes show certain differences dependent on the underyling illness (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic scleroderma, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, Sjögren syndrome, and mixed connective tissue disease).	1.005054912871109
In addition to vasculitis and granulomatosis of the lung, therapy-induced lung changes must also be considered in the differential diagnosis since almost all basic therapeutic agents can cause this type of lung condition.	1.027389340396107
Good knowledge of the parameters from the viewpoint of possible therapeutic measures is indispensable, as is close cooperation between the treating physician and the pathologist.	1.1242756717601448
Scintigraphic imaging identifies pathophysiological processes; in other words it assesses regional perfusion, permeability, leukocytic accumulation and bone turnover.	0.8721246981498052
These processes precede morphological changes and this accounts for the high sensitivity of nuclear medicine procedures as well as the low specificity for the differential diagnosis of different diseases with similar pathophysiological characteristics.	1.182315636049844
This review (1) describes and evaluates the currently used scintigraphic procedures, (2) suggests their differential use in certain clinical settings in comparison with alternative radiological methods and (3) addresses new developments in diagnosis using nuclear medicine procedures.	1.0258619509147195
In summary, we advise dynamic bone scanning as a primary scintigraphic investigation.	1.0677855707266817
A negative scan excludes osteomyelitis in most cases.	0.6763911242837835
The comparison is made with conventional radiology and clinical history.	0.8136928049417012
In cases with short clinical histories ( = granulocytic inflammation), leukocyte scintigraphy should be the next diagnostic step; in chronic processes (lymphomonocytic inflammation), gallium scintigraphy is advisable.	1.272607835322038
Other scintigraphic methods might be of additional use in experienced hands.	0.8862121164873861
SPECT is useful for clarifying inconclusive planar scans of the head, spine and large joints.	0.9655254880747547
To assess the clinical effectiveness of glaucoma therapy with diode laser cyclophotocoagulation, 106 eyes (51 eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma, 22 eyes with secondary glaucoma, 10 eyes with narrow-angle glaucoma, 23 eyes with other glaucomas) of 87 patients were treated.	1.1012827925738644
Using a diode laser coupled with a fiberoptic probe, ending in a focusing tip, all eyes were treated with 24-30 spots over 360  ° and 2.8-3.6 J of energy, 1.5 mm posterior to the limbus.	1.2190428154378428
The intraocular pressure was obtained over a period of time until 8-24 months after operation.	1.086745993354059
Additionally, morphological changes of the ciliary body were observed in 25 eyes by means of ultrasound biomicroscopy.	1.1280179390777987
Our objective was to determine the efficacy of ESWL treatment in children and the extent of auxiliary measures.	1.0255609172614681
In a retrospective analysis we investigated number of auxiliary measures and the stone-free rate in children after ESWL treatment.	1.0058489702072797
We report a 44-year-old female patient who underwent surgery because of a suspected primary tumor of the renal pelvis in imaging procedures.	1.271838978094027
Histology revealed the diagnosis of mesoblastic nephroma.	0.7612903852623326
This tumor represents a special entity of nephroblastoma that rarely occurs in adults.	0.7202772615901668
There is no unanimous opinion on the biological behavior of mesoblastic nephroma because the tumor behaves differently.	0.8721985901258038
The question of whether nephrectomy is indicated if there are no malignant features is also open.	1.1622984958396982
The decision depends on the given case.	0.6837069048766966
Nephrectomy can only be avoided if the intraoperative situation allows the tumor to be removed with an adequate distance from healthy tissue.	1.089514864854015
The safety margin is necessary because mesoblastic nephroma shows fingerlike spread into the surrounding tissue.	0.8165113574650238
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) is a non-invasive method of recording quantitative data from gas exchange and ventilation for the evaluation of oxidative metabolism at rest and during exercise.	1.0623399732917853
Determination of oxygen uptake (VO2) and carbon dioxide output (VCO2) describes the activity of anaerobic vs aerobic metabolism.	0.9649399245814416
An incremental exercise test measuring gas exchange, ventilation and lactate release was performed in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from mitochondrial disorders.	0.9769788336697889
At rest as well as during exercise patients with mitochondrial disorders differ from healthy subjects with regard to gas exchange and ventilation parameters.	1.0294478626964862
During exercise, the decreased oxygen utilization of skeletal muscle and early activation of anaerobic metabolism in these patients are mirrored by a reduced anaerobic threshold, reduced maximal oxygen uptake and reduced oxygen pulse.	1.08664557979896
Our study shows that CPX is a sensitive and practical clinical screening method of investigating mitochondrial disorders.	0.8753296180765489
Monitoring of pH of the esophagus is a routine diagnostic procedure, whereas until now pH-monitoring of the hypopharynx has been used only for scientific research.	1.2029288080340972
In the present study a critical evaluation scale was used to record the results of 112 patients who underwent pH monitoring to determine possible reflux.	1.2439057493320678
Since high refluxes often remain unnoticed clinically, further study is required in certain cases.	1.1458028196670942
The extent of reflux in the esophagus may not represent pathological changes in the hypopharynx.	0.9084486137132123
In such cases 24-h pH monitoring of the hypopharynx can be a useful diagnostic procedure and may also help detect the pathogenesis of "gastric laryngitis".	1.1691063699778974
The occurrence of plasmodial giant cells in the liver is probably a morphological reaction pattern with the most diverse causes.	1.015143540700142
In babies and infants, these changes occur in particular in neonatal hepatitis and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct atresia.	1.0094719809861201
Viral infections and/or autoimmune reactions are discussed etiologically in giant cell hepatitis in adults (adult giant cell hepatitis, AGCH), which is much rarer.	1.1047611997458249
In some of the cases, there were conspicuously high titers against paramyxoviruses.	1.179236238779382
Giant cell hepatitis can occur in the course of HIV infection.	0.8970773039013853
These both indicate an infectious cause.	0.5513924790763632
However, the disease cannot be transmitted to chimpanzees.	1.16176552435203
Apart from our case, only one further case is described in the literature in which a completed hepatitis A infection could be demonstrated serologically.	1.289195913906063
In addition, the titer of antinuclear antibodies was raised in our patient.	0.9195936920550251
This autoimmune phenomenon is probably of crucial pathogenetic significance in our patient, especially since a hepatitis A infection on its own does not afford an adequate etiological explanation for the form of chronic and active hepatitis with consecutive cirrhotic transformation observed here.	1.1035003121410027
In patients with a significant elongation of the ACL we propose a new therapeutic regimen.	1.2531407985596987
After mobilisation of the tibial insertion of the ACL we pull the bone block with the attached ACL distally.	0.8084786323657147
Thus the ACL is easily tightened.	0.6808245373942289
In accordance with this method, we describe the treatment of a case of a strictly proximal rupture of the ACL: the tibial insertion is mobilised, the bone block with the attached ACL removed from the joint.	1.4159462077913811
Ex vivo sutures are placed into the ACL, the ligament is pulled back into the joint, and the shortening of the ligament caused by the sutures is compensated by slight proximal dislocation of the bone block.	1.1608337072529822
Purpose: One aspect of biocompatibility of IOLs can be tested using specular microscopy of the anterior and posterior surface of the lens in vivo.	1.0259942764093362
Background: The paper focuses on the issues, how couples cope with SIDS and how this can be facilitated by subsequent children, self-help and professional support.	1.0364143630163827
Methods: In a retrospective study, 60 couples, members of a self-help organization, were studied at the average of 5 years (2-215 months) after their loss.	1.3346431495055193
Depression, anxiety, physical complaints and grief were assessed by standardized questionnaires.	0.8065112293883688
A community sample of equal size of men and women of the same age were used as controls.	0.9497561777587699
Results: Average scores of depression and physical complaints were elevated compared to the community sample.	1.138044173616162
Men and women coped differently with the loss: Bereft mothers were more depressed and ruminated more about cause and preventability of the death than fathers.	0.8810991037644905
They expressed their grief more openly and found it more helpful to speak about their loss.	0.74510543451899
The presence of subsequent children was of prime importance for coping with the loss; an early subsequent pregnancy was fraught with increased anxiety.	0.9898269509360829
Conclusions: The self-help group serves an important function as a coping resource; the pediatrician plays a key role in the psychosocial care of the afflicted families.	1.0654052060350059
A 63-year-old women developed livedo reticularis during treatment with amantadine.	0.9008026810417634
This reversible side effect of amantadine has been most often seen in women and is frequently associated with persistent ankle edema.	0.9695629418028443
We discuss the signs and symptoms, pathogenesis and treatment of amantadine-induced livedo reticularis.	0.9695984958329434
Despite the diagnostic criteria of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV, the term borderline has been used in a non-specific way for a long time.	1.1357103107601316
For our investigation we constructed a questionnaire, which contained the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for the borderline personality disorder (BPD), plus the criteria for the other personality disorders and for the schizotype disorder.	1.1530551138078873
The two additional criteria for the BPD used by the DSM-IV were added.	1.0186985714376773
800 psychiatrists and psychologists were asked to mark all criteria, which they thought were typical for the BPD.	1.0175661090469048
By using the operational diagnostic approach for ICD-10 and DSM-IV a disorder was diagnosed from each of the 162 received questionnaires based on the marked criteria.	1.0395602616274948
92,0% of the questionnaires contained marked criteria for the diagnosis of the BPD by ICD-10 and 96,3% by DSM-IV.	1.296677675358427
In addition each questionnaire contained up to eight other diagnosis.	0.7224651213058212
This is a sign for the difficulty to separate the BPD from other personalitiy disorders or the schizotype  disorder by using operationalised criteria.	1.0173063777654006
Looking at the lack of specifity of the operational diagnostic systems for personality  disorders, e.g.	0.7920165415140255
for the BPD which has been discussed by many authors for years, modification of the diagnostic systems should be considered.	1.1144848061785146
Neurobiological research has implicated the dopamine and serotonin system in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behavior.	0.871143890705117
The efficacy of antipsychotic drugs has been questioned.	0.6142382137734319
Opened and controlled investigations have shown risperidone is effective for reducing self-injurious behaviour in mentally retardation.	0.8978870108865807
We report about 3 mentally retarded patients which were given open-label riperidone for 12 weeks.They participated in a detailed assessment of behaviour symptoms at baseline and the repititive behaviour was weekly rated with the disability assessment schedule (DAS).	0.9907174939193766
Purpose: To test the capabilities of vacuum core biopsy (VCB) in the diagnosis of mammographically indeterminate lesions.	1.0523382866905926
Materials and Methods: 120 patients (131 lesions) were examined using VCB with 14G or 11G vacuum core.	1.0877555265954695
Radiologic information systems (RIS) and picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) are becoming increasingly widespread.	1.0319339440226314
This leads to new demands on the integration of the individual, formerly independent information systems (RIS, modalities, PACS).	0.9939948598418472
Possible ways of integrating individual systems are introduced.	0.7160430683547457
Besides the detailed description of different realizations of system communication, its role in the PACS at the university hospital in Freiburg is explained.	1.020570922272183
The integration of different information systems still requires the use of proprietary interfaces.	0.8738860620293387
An appropriate integration generally has been realized in Freiburg.	0.6672733838407277
In the near future DICOM basic worklist management will standardize system integration and render an interdepartmental workflow concept possible.	0.7409858876680635
Even though an available communication standard exists, not all problems in the RIS-modality interface are solved.	0.9188323366845671
Different data models in the various RI systems and modalities demand certain degrees of freedom in the standard.	0.8394391855035789
Thus a satisfactory workflow cannot be guaranteed even when all involved systems conform with the standard.	0.8219484925786645
Background: Denecke developed 1957 a surgical strategy consisting of three or four operative steps for rehabilitation of patients with unilateral paralysis of IXth and Xth cranial nerve.	1.099222928960762
These four steps are the following: myotomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle, resection of the paralyzed pharyngeal wall, medialization of the paralyzed vocal cord and fixation of the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall which can be facultative.	1.0224061736875227
Reconstruction of the navel after tumour excision with subsequent navel resection is of great aesthetic importance for the patient.	0.9141863468030402
Methods of navel reconstruction are found in the literature but do not provide an elegant solution to the problem.	1.0614971934553956
Our method permits reconstruction of the navel during wound closure, by creation of two opposing trapezoidal skin flaps at the excision margin in the midline of the body; the umbilical fossa is then restored by jointly anchoring these flaps to the linea alba.	1.010738768415206
Reconstruction has been successfully carried out in this way after melanoma excision in 7 patients.	1.0666079663139307
Mammography is an established diagnostic procedure for breast cancer.	0.9013696991828493
Data concerning screening mammography are available from nine prospectively controlled trials, the largest series being presented from Sweden.	0.9981879834800053
Mammographic screening leads to a significant reduction of breast cancer of 30 % in women ages 50-59 years.	1.235310260924707
In younger women (40-49 years) the benefit accounts to only 20 % and has not proven to be statistically significant.	1.4006601675771888
Nevertheless, the major advantage of mammographic screening is detection of the non-palpable tumor <= 10 mm in size.	1.2123643787602238
The treatment of these small breast carcinomas leads to long-term survival rates of >= 90 %.	1.2265685015854106
Mammographic screening programs have been introduced in the USA, Canada, Iceland and Sweden for women in their 5th decade of life.	0.9036985950981842
Starting yearly lifelong mammography-screening at the age of 40, the theoretical cancer induction by radiation exposure does not exceed 0.1 %.	0.9804045268089361
Under highly qualified conditions, it should be possible to minimize false-positive and false-negative screening results.	1.0436316859303043
In Germany, screening-mammography is only introduced in patients at high risk for breast cancer.	1.0262956840751616
Based on medical data, mammography must be a part of screening for women with an average risk - starting at the age of 40, although there are still open questions needing further clinical research.	1.1586899399740733
Upper lid closure in facial nerve paresis induced lagophthalmos is often improved by implantation of gold weights.	0.7938554487799258
However, the tolerability of gold implants has not always met expectations.	1.0047613407378697
We therefore investigated whether results could be improved by implantation of well-tolerated platinum implants.	0.9009745788260852
Methods to determine the mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures are valuable tools in wound healing research.	0.7612774135088121
So far standardized testing procedures have not been defined in the surgical literature, which reduces the comparability of results from different authors.	1.1612108809518467
Therefore we suggest a modified tensile testing procedure which follows German industrial standards (DIN 53 455).	0.8368003359960099
The experimental set-up includes an universal testing machine and special clamps.	0.7521541092790617
The dumbbell-shaped specimen consist of freshly prepared pig skin and the suture which is to be tested.	0.9132538241612054
Well-known mechanical properties of surgical sutures and wounds were used to approve the precision of the experimental set-up.	1.0296582767589875
Reproducible analysis of all tested sutures and wounds (n = 120) was possible.	1.234940530592331
We recommend testing procedures adapted to industrial standards to obtain comparable results in determination of mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures.	0.8484250544623019
Abstract  An infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to a large variety of complications affecting almost every organ system.	0.928962695121707
With the increasing numbers of HIV infections, some authors have reported an occasional association between an infection with HIV and arterial aneurysm.	1.09432536411601
However, complications affecting the vascular system demanding surgical intervention are rare.	1.3603466406163893
Partial nasal obstruction in preterm and term infants increases airway resistance.	0.7052047005935324
It may reduce ventilation and cause disturbances of respiratory regulation.	0.8242440592531574
Although this is well established, nasogastric tubes are commonly used, because orogastric tubes are difficult to secure.	1.005299440672176
A new technique for fixing orogastric tubes was tested in a prospective study in 11 preterm and term infants over a 4 weeks period.	1.038728353303955
There was no preterm dislocation of an oral tube in 7 patients.	1.0123174740952388
The orogastric tube had to be reinserted once before regular change in 3 patients and only 1 patiend aged 15 weeks presented with multiple dislocations of the tube.	0.9911834020966445
On the basis of a 3 days period for regular change of the orogastric tube the reliability of this new technique was 86,2% for all patients and 92,5% for patients below 8 weeks of age.	1.3201380226512485
Mesenchymal neoplasms of lipogenic differentiation are the most common soft-tissue neoplasms in adults.	0.9662271329438915
In recent years a number of "new" entities and variants have been described.	0.9494257271353929
Their recognition is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls and inappropriate therapy.	0.823601383869833
Chondroid lipoma, myolipoma, and purely cutaneous spindle-cell/pleomorphic lipoma are biologically benign neoplasms which may mimic sarcomas morphologically.	0.9599639902093039
Despite high-grade morphology cutaneous liposarcomas carry a favorable clinical prognosis.	0.855332356104975
Spindle cell liposarcoma is a rare variant of atypical lipomatous tumour (well-differentiated liposarcoma) and must be distinguished from dedifferentiated liposarcoma with metastatic potential and benign spindle cell lipoma.	0.9896516100601539
The advent of cytogenetic and molecular investigations of lipomatous neoplasms has contributed to a better understanding of the biology of these neoplasms and led to a modification of conventional classification schemes.	0.8763900399625417
The intracranial space is divided into two large compartments by the tentorium.	0.9162958613813204
The hydrostatic pressure of spinal fluid is responsible for buoyancy of the brain within these compartments.	0.9662912664468308
In patients with craniectomy this equilibrium is exposed to atmospheric pressure.	0.6930014523955436
We report on four cases of reversible herniation after either bilateral or unilateral decompressive craniectomy performed for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and failure of conservative ICP treatment.	1.0508698778859824
All four patients had survived a severe neurological disease (encephalitis, subdural haematoma, stroke) which required craniectomy to control raised ICP.	1.0805949189545374
All were successfully weaned from the ventilator and awake and CT scans showed no space-occupying lesion anymore.	0.9043841145998813
The patients showed a typical "sunken pattern" at the trepanation site.	1.0767159705950533
All patients developed clinical signs of transtentorial herniation (i.e.	0.6133918332995311
unilateral dilated pupils, deteriorated alertness, and extensor posturing) shortly after either diagnostic or presumed therapeutic lumbar puncture.	0.9018057966264904
One patient developed herniation a second time while in the typical 30 ° upright position.	1.0460422303436647
After craniectomy, transtentorial herniation is possible even in the absence of increased ICP.	0.855880484072444
It is related to a negative gradient between atmospheric and intracranial pressure, which is enhanced by changes in the CSF compartment following lumbar puncture.	1.0525030777142106
Lumbar puncture should be avoided if possible and, when necessary, only be performed in the head-down position.	1.3418353394607576
Acute therapy in these cases is quite simple; it requires flat or even head-down positioning and early cranioplasty.	1.0737025069665593
Diseases of the oral cavity, floor of the mouth, and nervous system can be accompanied by disturbances in tongue movement during swallowing.	0.8195529276762622
These disturbances can be diagnosed by videosonography whereby the examiner has to evaluate extensive video documentation of lingual motion.	0.9043405576045804
It was the aim of this study to facilitate this evaluation by the application of a reproducible computer-assisted quantitative analysis procedure.	1.0575874944649015
Video sequences of 56 healthy adults and 19 patients with dysphagias of different etiologies were analysed.	0.9660874370587226
A numerical estimation of swallowing movements was carried out in abstraction from the structures imaged (bolus, air, muscles of the tongue, floor of the mouth, hyoid, etc.).	0.876294587595483
Intensity changes of the pixels within previously defined radial image sectors were quantified in relationship to time and depicted as sector curves.	0.8048371180509966
The healthy adults demonstrated a characteristic pattern of two motion maxima that appeared within almost all sector curves.	0.853572898372876
These maxima represented bolus transport movements and the reset movement of the tongue.	0.7742072106462767
Patients with diseases of the tongue or neuromuscular changes caused by disturbances of the central nervous system showed pathological deviations on videosonography.	0.8954698833645712
These appeared as local or general reductions in movement, slow speed motions, repetitive swallowing or unsorted additional movements of the tongue during swallowing.	0.9505649264418984
Clinically-used ketamine is a racemic mixture of two isomers, S-(+)- and R-(-)-ketamine.	1.0859568016713286
Previous investigations showed the anaesthetic potency of S-(+)-ketamine to be three times higher than that of R-(-)-ketamine.	1.1026867725561402
It was the aim of this study to compare the effects of S-(+)-ketamine and racemic ketamine on endocrine and cardiovascular parameters, recovery, and side effects in geriatric patients during total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) for orthopaedic surgery.	0.9839054101519001
Forty patients over 60 years of age scheduled for elective hip or knee replacement were investigated in a double-blind, randomised design.	0.9852857899092295
For induction of TIVA, patients received 0.1 mg midazolam, 0.5 mg atropine, 1 mg/kg S(+)-ketamine or 2 mg/kg racemic ketamine, respectively, 2 mg vecuronium, and 1.5 mg/kg suxamethonium.	1.3490630412684046
After intubation and relaxation with a total dose of 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium, a continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg per hour S-(+)- or 4 mg/kg per hour racemic ketamine was administered throughout surgery.	1.0920353307662682
Blood samples were taken through a central venous catheter at seven time-points, before induction as well during and after surgery, until the 1st postoperative morning for analysis of adrenaline, noradrenaline (by high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection), anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol (by radioimmunoassay), glucose, and lactate.	1.2213651532400822
In addition, systolic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR), and arterial oxygen saturation were measured, and the time intervals between the end of ketamine infusion and the return of consciousness and orientation were protocolled.	1.272842194519544
The incidence and assessment of dreams and other side effects were reported by the patients.	0.9502118758873892
Biometric data of the groups were comparable, the mean age of both groups being 68 years.	1.2570777565163092
Plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, ADH, ACTH, cortisol, and glucose as well as SAP and HR increased significantly (P<0.05) during the course of anaesthesia.	0.998460333167826
The influence on lactate levels was not significant.	0.7771447065322779
There were no differences between S-(+)- and racemic ketamine with respect to these parameters.	0.9863900841718938
Three patients in the ketamine-racemate group showed severe arterial hypertension and were withdrawn from the study.	0.931445458888748
Recovery clearly improved after administration of S-(+)-ketamine compared to the racemate.	0.8967855771454321
Simple orders were followed after 2.0 +/- 3.4 versus 4.9 +/- 6.8 min (P=0.07), orientation with respect to person returned after 5.7 +/- 4.0 versus 14.6 +/- 10.0 min (P<0.001) and spatial orientation after 8.2 +/- 5.4 versus 17.4 +/- 9.7 min (P<0.001).	1.1503641521805152
After racemic ketamine, 1 patient remembered a negative dream and 1 patient a positive dream.	1.1173646671803281
In the S-(+)-group, 1 positive dream was reported.	0.8955192582768198
No intraoperative awareness was reported, and all patients would accept the same anaesthesia again.	0.9676710986616941
Increases in cardiovascular parameters and insufficient reduction of the stress response with respect to ADH, ACTH, and cortisol seem to require a more potent hypnotic element during TIVA with ketamine.	0.9746687295296604
With regard to endocrine and cardiovascular parameters, the pharmacodynamic effects of racemic and S-(+)-ketamine were comparable.	0.8999590146309889
Because of the significant improvement in recovery and the reduced quantitative drug load, S-(+)-ketamine offers a clinical advantage compared with currently used racemic ketamine.	0.9361762935559437
The closure of large circular defects on the scalp is technically difficult and cosmetically often not satisfying, if a free transplant is necessary.	1.0391727319239286
Following the technique of Tillmann described first in 1908, several flaps shaped like a windmill can be combined.	0.9045637252766573
We report on 14 patients (ages 41-88 years) where large defects resulting from the excision of various tumors (5 melanomas, 5 basal cell carcinomas, 1 keratoacanthoma, 1 trichilemmal cyst, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 skin metastasis) were successfully closed by this method.	1.2866809259200098
The diameter of the defect ranged between 4 and 8 cm (mean 5,7 cm).	1.0523414595329914
Size and number of the rotating flaps (3 or 4) was varied according to the size of the defect and the mobility of the surrounding tissue.	1.2372393828537103
The procedure was performed with local anesthesia in all cases.	1.2034578969799137
Wound healing occurred without complications except in 3 cases.	0.8503624525771164
2 patients (63 years, 70 years) developed small necrotic areas on the tips of the flaps.	1.00479385545041
In a 74 year old man with a very large defect of 8 cm diameter, one flap of four underwent total necrosis.	1.0234990737078113
The cosmetic result was rated "very good" in 71,4% and "good" in 14,3%.	1.1058682603999395
The preservation of the terminal hair turned out to be of special advantage.	1.0556515307665795
The "windmill procedure" is an important addition to the surgical approaches for closure of large defects on the scalp, particularly in young patients.	1.2027360482466714
Intimal sarcoma of the pulmonary artery is an extremely rare type of malignant tumor of the large vessels.	1.0798115507523416
Despite systematic diagnostics, distinguishing between pulmonary emboli and tumors is difficult.	0.70689775751792
We report a patient who was referred because of suspected embolic occlusion of the pulmonary artery.	1.0669719869669558
The operation was started with the intention of performing a pulmonary artery thromboendarterectomy; however, intraoperative histology revealed a malignant mesenchymal tumor.	1.161682582855217
Therefore, the left lung was resected with the use of extracorporeal circulation, and the pulmonary trunk and right pulmonary artery were reconstructed.	1.3541748530297455
A solitary right lung metastasis was resected 3 months later using stapling devices.	0.8265241200743869
Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with sarcoma of the pulmonary arteries.	1.0176300527883095
Surgical therapy often includes extensive reconstructive measures.	0.5816781846035001
Since, thromboembolic obstruction cannot be excluded preoperatively, patients with this type of disease should be treated at centers experienced with the broad spectrum of pulmonary artery surgery.	1.1455719194837937
Abstract  A rare cause of painful swelling of the knee cavity can be an aneurysm of the popliteal vein.	1.2036012867434571
Only 28 cases are reported in the literature.	0.5606477896544272
We treated a 20-year-old male patient who underwent three arthroscopies, one operation and one MRI; finally, phlebography detected a popliteal vein aneurysm and a malformation of the deep venous system of the popliteal and proximal calf veins.	1.1761961425192928
To avoid the threat of pulmonary embolism a resection of the aneurysm with interposition of a venous autograft was performed.	1.0146379907647163
Twelve months after the operation the patient is free of symptoms with a patent autograft.	1.2361503715191302
Hearing aids have fundamental disadvantages: (1) stigmatization of the patient; (2) the sound is often found to be unsatisfactory due to the limited frequency range and undesired distortion; (3) in many patients, the ear canal fitting device generally necessary leads to an occlusion effect; (4) acoustic feedback when amplification is high.	1.2183134439899257
Conventional hearing aids transmit sound into the ear canal via a small microphone.	0.8054883394247367
Sound has the disadvantage of requiring high output sound pressure levels for its transmission.	0.8454546420980475
This along with the necessary miniaturization of the loudspeaker as well as the resonances and reflections in the closed ear canal contribute to the disadvantages mentioned.	1.0661638918461251
In contrast, implantable hearing aids do not make sound signals but micromechanical vibrations.	0.9456575938538659
An implantable hearing aid has an electromechanical transducer instead of the loudspeaker of a conventional hearing aid.	0.8773057079538636
The hearing signal does not leave the transducer as sound but as a mechanical vibration which is directly coupled to the auditory system bypassing the air.	0.8344110971912102
This implantable hearing aid is either coupled to the tympanic membrane, the ossicular chain, the perilymph of the inner ear, or the skull.	1.1704352193536058
Corneal cells are known to participate in the regulation of local inflammatory processes by secretion of cytokines.	0.8716876889566971
As the corneal endothelium may be exposed to endotoxin in organ culture and endotoxin is known to trigger inflammatory reactions, we investigated the effect of endotoxin from E. coli on organ cultured donor corneae with respect to autocrine and paracrine functions and the endothelial viability and density.	0.9967749470061253
For the majority of patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) many available hearing aids often do not achieve satisfactory results.	0.787405746739718
For these patients partially implantable hearing devices have been developed, allowing distortion-free hearing and speech intelligibility that may be superior to conventional hearing aids.	1.0245687664223324
The external parts of partial implants, however, may result in a patient's stigmatization.	1.2202568827490878
Furthermore, they do not use the acoustic properties of the external auditory canal.	1.4054786122462803
Recently, we published the successful development of the first totally implantable hearing device for the treatment of SNHL (HNO 46 [1998] 853-863).	1.1526117739840427
Here we report the first implantations of this unique, totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients with SNHL: Implex TICA LZ 3001.	1.0057201990969458
The implant microphone is implanted subcutaneously in the outer ear canal near the ear drum.	0.8413833880005314
The signal is processed by a digitally programmable multichannel audioprocessor located subcutaneously on the bony skull behind the ear.	0.7332153592360552
A piezoelectric transducer is coupled to the body of the incus and drives the ossicular chain by vibratory actions.	0.8274492468863514
Energy is provided by an implantable battery.	0.7698280913825915
Implanted patients describe hearing as being distortion-free and transparent.	0.8457103545550768
Speech intelligibility and the hearing of music are improved.	0.7361323280553214
Patients may achieve better speech discrimination, especially in the presence of background noise.	0.8863481962909168
The aid can be used during sports, including swimming.	1.1931813487915726
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the implantation of a totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients.	0.8225998333857432
These results encourage further implantations of the totally implantable hearing system in the course of an ongoing clinical study.	0.9809380217522687
Catheter ablation by means of radiofrequency energy (RF) is an established method in the treatment of various forms of supraventricular and atrioventricular tachycardias.	1.0144495589785032
In patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), the success of catheter ablation depends on the pathophysiological mechanism of the arrhythmia and on the underlying heart disease.	1.0779229364967882
In the following report we give a definition of the terms nomenclature and classification.	1.0154521043659328
We find out, that the two terms are very similar.	1.0870042961840864
They include the keys for diagnosis and therapy.	0.7526050997816669
We propose a method to construct new coding-systems.	0.7551447208760291
Furthermore we report about the existing coding-systems in Orthopaedics and Traumatology.	0.9622114255723496
We cite a list of national and international coding-systems.	0.6637622882132356
Because of the actuality we finally give a definition of the term "Indikationsspezifische Komplikation", which is of importance since the "5.	1.1857440199397127
Änderungsverordnung" of the "BPFLV-95" within the classification of the "Fallpauschalen".	1.0796655161803164
"Fallpauschalen" are a system like the American DRG's (Diagnosis related groups), but not exacly the same.	1.2608808848687345
Resection of a stenosing colon tumor in an 89-year-old male patient led to the diagnosis, unusual at this age, of an inflammatory pseudotumor (synonym: plasma cell granuloma) of the retroperitoneum and mesentery, which invaded the large bowel and showed infiltration of one regional lymph node.	1.1721948917051572
Histology and immunohistochemistry (demonstrating a myofibroblastic phenotype of the proliferating spindle cells and polyclonality of abundantly present plasma cells) of the specimen resembled previously reported lesions in various locations.	0.9829104979849658
The etiology and exact nosological classification of inflammatory pseudotumors are not yet unequivocally settled.	0.9453702813203558
