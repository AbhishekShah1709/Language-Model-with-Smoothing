For us, the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, it is not only the reform of the institutions of the European Union which will be important in the next five years; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidating the European currency in coming years.	1.0111666034570412
We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact.	0.6500758538461822
We need structural reforms in the European economy.	1.0119174179047004
Most importantly, we need to restore a European economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs.	0.6134654144041106
It would be Europe' s undoing if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium-sized businesses in Europe.	0.7251032993037424
(Applause) The Commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays.	0.7938480685873996
We too want to help put Europe on its feet.	0.6467801612934587
You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	0.40816491837078983
We support that.	0.16448281694800143
The nations, regions, towns and communities of Europe will be preserved.	0.6574057736785053
However, there is a current trend - the "fauna, flora, habitat" directive was quoted as an example - which, in my country at least, creates the impression that associations are bypassing national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to Brussels and that Brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural holdings in the countries of the European Union.	0.717984080819383
I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future.	0.7919965941639322
Mr President of the Commission, allow me to close with these words: as the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, we have every interest in a strong Commission.	0.8820565739784332
If you are persuasive in your actions, we all reap the benefits.	0.8380830498178773
In this respect we wish you every success. However, we are also aware of our role as the Commission' s watchdog.	1.012644445524974
If we have the merest suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the European Union, and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case -, but if European law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement uncompromisingly, precisely because peace in the European Union is founded on this law.	1.0248631324510704
We must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world.	0.7605461998070169
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of, and the first ever debate on, the Commission' s programme for government - the word President Prodi is so fond of; as I am -for the whole legislature.	0.9180536684330786
Firstly, this is welcome because it explains, to our fellow citizens, what we are intending to do and what we are already doing. We must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future.	1.1108200536375021
We have taken almost eleven months - President Prodi was nominated at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme. This is not entirely President Prodi' s fault.	0.8952075640185228
We are recovering from a crisis. However, I believe that, in the future, it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next Commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme.	0.9151821234083192
We are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances.	0.35201742416932097
President Prodi began his speech by talking of a paradoxical situation, a paradox in the European Union and also throughout the world: we are at the dawn of a new secular millennium, dominated by the web of the Internet and the sorcery of biotechnological advance, and we are living through a genuine change of epoch.	0.8805604462660859
However, to focus on the European Union as it is today, and on the subject of government and governance - a word which, at least in Spanish, brings to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, although it may be an appropriate word anyway -, the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government, and, since President Prodi always defends his home town, Bologna, I would advise him to go to Siena for a while and see something which we all understand: the frescos of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which speak of bon governo [good government] and mal governo [bad government].	0.9622841238967673
What we need here is good government, Madam President.	0.614095193495637
Since we are recovering from a very complex crisis, we must try to enhance our institutions and give them substance.	0.7064724807326894
I would like to remind the House of something which we often forget, and that is that the investiture of the Prodi Commission, last September, received wide support. In our opinion, this demonstrates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of Europe.	0.9096645134339529
I would like to point out that, within this broad consensus, there were some Groups which said that the majority of Parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the Council.	0.9238883575604449
It is precisely this which, in a sense, is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme.	0.9780319796097574
I am pointing this out because I believe that our support for the Commission also has to lead to continuity in the work carried out throughout the legislature.	0.8320343095608407
On the other hand, we are witnessing the birth of a political Europe, which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon, and a European Union at the service of the citizens.	1.080571274499605
With regard to the events of recent days, I would like to say - and I am saying this on the day, and the week, that the Intergovernmental Conference is starting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which, given what we have said about the Austrian crisis, I believe should be fully included in the Treaties.	1.0846868274795838
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point.	1.2134282510820351
In this regard, Madam President, I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language.	0.7014363781802803
Last week, the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre.	0.8368505409560378
Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments.	0.6051606719146729
There can be no democracy without a living parliament.	0.4594396788709491
I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now.	0.7919628014868321
With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us, I would say that we are very much in agreement.	0.9124496968159667
Nevertheless, I would point out to the Commission that, as far as the Socialist Group is concerned, there has been a change of priorities.	1.1417854454748386
We understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda, which also includes what is known as 'quality of life' priorities, that is to say, the rights of citizens as consumers and as people, in relation to those questions which we always talk about, but never give sufficient priority to, that is, the European social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances, consumer rights, respect for the environment and sustainable development.	1.0224609557931
When speaking of the commitment to full employment, we have to bear in mind that, these days, full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War, that is to say, employment for the male head of the household.	0.8149263657284189
We must argue for equality of the sexes, the famous 'gender mainstreaming' , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission' s programme.	0.7494584737707984
This means prioritising sex equality, the adaptation of the social model and, above all, an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat.	0.7905107052972651
This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission. It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics.	0.9936772431440438
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue.	1.1089328619648813
In this respect I would also add another element, which is economic government, given the single currency, and I believe this is inescapable. This is another question on which the Commission must make progress.	1.174364945697173
With regard to the ambitious objectives and, above all, the Commission' s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration, I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000.	0.8370936919313362
Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision?	0.6650435069660381
The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential.	0.71789785938767
With regard to governance in general, I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms.	0.8466336711433043
I would like to remind you of one thing: it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here.	0.7872977611092401
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity.	0.716062337158476
If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is, I think that would be very positive.	1.0027602543642813
In all other areas, I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion.	0.7106178939256226
Not only should the Commission discuss this, but also our states, our parliaments and our civil society.	0.8389288524199707
Madam President, I would like to refer briefly to the last objective, which seems to us to be absolutely fundamental: the stabilisation of the continent and the strengthening of the Europe' s role in the world.	0.8610442758462505
It appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of South-East Europe, with regard to enlargement and - as I have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts, as well as an issue which we seldom talk about; the North-South challenge.	0.8958552666728218
We must not forget Africa, a continent which has been forsaken, not only by God, but also by Europe, nor our important contribution to cooperating with development.	1.0159101049692412
Lastly, an issue for which we are increasingly responsible, as the world' s foremost economic and commercial power, that is, Europe' s voice in the world, which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the Millennium Round.	0.988019703569383
It means the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions, for which Europe has an enormous responsibility.	1.0017817762454853
Above all, Madam President - and here I will end - we must be able to express this in plain language, clearly, by changing to some extent the jargon which we use, because we cannot ask the Europeans, who are living through profound changes, to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely inaccessible.	0.9477019346491741
This is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us. I hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next European elections.	0.8921692843135985
Mr President of the Commission, may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure, the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today: that is that the stakes now are irrefutably political.	0.9794985249488095
They are political because we are moving on.	0.6012347359723752
Even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks, we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective.	0.8227683021762814
The challenge of enlargement is political.	0.6530917564285589
The challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs, of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime, is very political.	0.8772627126095313
The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political.	0.7843528259196998
Because it is political it is more complex.	0.6528399303721721
Because it is political it is more sovereignty-sensitive.	0.5235132038634162
Because it is more sovereignty-sensitive it is more voter-and citizen-sensitive.	0.6428295843370251
We need, therefore, to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives, to address, not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy, the apathy which you identify.	0.8742713965675076
The means of achieving this are difficult but they are real.	0.6820482010197618
I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions, not just between Commission and Parliament, but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge.	1.127319986271832
We need more dialogue, not just with each other but also with civil society.	0.978520614697716
We need more explanation of what Europe is about.	0.5921199196415665
We need to be able to confront fears and anxieties, because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself.	0.6729553903497428
Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that.	0.37743331701661814
My group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring addressing the issue of governance.	0.555049999989712
As we look at the Europe of networking which you describe, it is very important that Europe concentrates on its core business, that we have the courage to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back.	0.8723788621027792
That could convince people that Europe, in its governance, is not something run exclusively from Brussels, which concentrates and soaks up more powers, more decisions, more authority.	0.9902096944013762
That is the political core of the challenge and I think you have identified it well before this House today.	0.9139987677226319
For my group, enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured, be they governance, be they the intergovernmental conference, be they reform of the institutions.	0.9919123520958222
We see enlargement as a process of partnership, not a process of "them and us".	0.7707666375449829
We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states.	0.3411170513251043
I suggest to the Commission, as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement, to present a document, that explains the value of enlargement, not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense; a document, like the Cecchini report before the Single Act, that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand, historic challenge facing Europe today.	1.0320231098998869
We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully.	0.5322695957186508
On south-eastern Europe, I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements.	0.7112596336134384
In the lifetime of this Commission and this Parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south-eastern Europe.	0.6664273358047967
We applaud the stabilisation and association agreements, but we would like to see more.	0.9827670719217036
We will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week.	0.5938874286420633
The strategic paper emphasises the global role of the European Union.	0.4975909094311984
Our central aim must be to give the Union a weight in global affairs commensurate with its weight in terms of aid, trade and finance.	0.6496402355314634
At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end, and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies, where we fit into UN agencies and so on.	0.6495952680682503
We need to open that debate.	0.47409863731263
In conclusion, this morning, the day after St Valentine's Day, the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over.	0.8220344437192594
I do not know whether you are a romantic or not, Mr Prodi.	0.9933394829784913
Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning.	0.8635921028111692
However, we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business.	0.9044834183179052
That is the way it should be.	1.2735361845539028
Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me, in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues, give in one adjective, one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance: an enabling Europe.	0.8788990326878456
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally.	0.9448853543763721
You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme.	0.5738054067701484
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones.	0.737822303857789
At the same time, however, it has to be said that, unfortunately, your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto.	0.84050221269762
There are a lot of good intentions in it, but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved.	0.8041688244911331
As in any other party manifesto, it is full of contradictions.	0.7412597582064981
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them.	0.5910947238564838
First let me speak about the economy and social development.	0.6908748509108378
We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment; that is what was mentioned in your programme.	0.8544412516701437
Should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria, in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than, say, the three most successful countries in this matter?	0.9459923008451393
Ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of, because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure. But, unfortunately, as we all know, this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act.	1.0135243858635559
Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference.	0.3621939313557871
The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone.	0.6251511182086507
In this respect, Parliament will definitely defend, along with yourselves, the importance of supranational decision-making.	0.7788266261973904
One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation.	0.26838767267426367
I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of 'global administration' , as others too have said here.	0.8379801345280699
However, please learn from the events of Seattle: we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade, on the one hand, with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend, on the other.	0.9761912087797056
You must embark on a dialogue with the international community.	0.5626001168348649
Do please try to make the international organisations democratic.	0.6657147854692862
The European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring.	0.9120835280440852
We can submit motions for this together with you.	0.35428360331169273
Finally, I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society, although, unfortunately, this is another contradiction.	0.9067110197585125
You ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the IGC.	0.48483350460525815
We have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making.	0.64929893829645
What you just said is absolutely true: people want more engaged democracy.	0.4587002737494164
In my opinion, this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too.	0.9879245254889596
Madam President, my group was one of those which wanted to have a document allowing an exchange of views on the Commission' s strategic objectives within the group before this debate, instead of being reduced to an on-the-spot reaction in plenary.	0.7544456062128947
The main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists.	0.9539895157812632
We are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which Mr Prodi has just underlined and, in some cases, usefully clarified.	0.8445191708357408
The current globalisation process is - and I quote - 'exclusive rather than inclusive and has widened the inequalities' . The European Union' s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rules within the Union and in international relations.	0.9204110398497699
Clearly, many citizens are 'disenchanted and anxious' about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems, such as unemployment and social exclusion, which affect our very existence. This must be one of our absolute priorities.	0.7972406431522776
We do need to rethink many aspects of current Community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success. We also need 'distinctive strategic partnerships' with our neighbours to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace.	0.8455718643630891
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion.	0.3282415940685934
We will carefully study the planned White Papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised.	0.5412852667903008
It is in this spirit that I have three criticisms to make. These must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new Europe, as proclaimed ambitiously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi' s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric.	0.9823748315204913
The first and most serious criticism concerns the Commission' s propensity for rather grandiloquent self-satisfaction with regard to the European Union and for a cursory and even condescending view of our partners.	0.630456894142923
The perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the Commission communication.	0.74085130539294
This talks of the European Union as 'living proof that peace, stability, freedom and prosperity can be brought to a continent' and as a model showing the world the way forward. It concludes that 'our neighbours have the chance to join this prosperity, and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so' .	0.8612288298908741
A more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view.	0.5338270849557717
Similarly, the idea that the euro has fostered a consensus on wage moderation is not really borne out by the repeated nervous orders issued by the European Central Bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding.	0.8187492753681246
My second criticism follows on from the first.	0.5233950731348588
This extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and, where necessary, confronting these is seriously limiting the will, duly confirmed by Mr Prodi, to grant public demands.	0.7602402975841918
For example, at least in the countries which I know well, I doubt that the intention, repeated three or four times in the Commission document, to reform 'Europe' s social protection, health care and pension systems ...in a climate of more cautious public spending' will meet the needs of those whose confidence we apparently want to win back.	0.8650594765516663
My third criticism stems from the first two. The weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an overabundance of generalisations, a rather indecisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus.	0.6604701337410895
But all is not lost.	0.3225803537488034
This is a starting point and we have five years to succeed, provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity.	0.8324243198998652
My group is fully intent on helping with this work.	0.4832736066376213
Madam President, reforming and democratising the institutions of the European Union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process.	0.7109122007885904
This was the opening statement of Commission President, Prodi, when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years.	1.0739836794643698
We await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union dealing with the issue of balance between Member States' governments and the European Union institutions which is to be published this summer.	0.9453913699848607
On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the Commission.	0.9606803790073413
The Commission, in its proposals to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference, has indicated that its preference lies in seeing smaller Member States lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the European Commission.	0.846794715170996
This is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States.	0.8289508322031005
I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built.	0.7619329226804201
I believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaties.	0.8434366307015609
There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions.	0.8204001251074804
I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small Member States to nominate a European Commissioner that the United States of America gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the United States Senate.	0.7973527000309175
More or less each of the 50 states in the US has two elected positions in the United States Senate, regardless of its population.	0.6579680018433703
Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country.	0.8243934018924987
It would be very difficult for those who propose a 'yes' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission.	0.7712270392900344
Undoubtedly, reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer.	1.0251852712927096
Once again there are special areas of policy-making which should be left to the domain of the national Member States.	0.6796463497948882
I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation, justice and home affairs, and foreign affairs at European Union level.	0.7666908848400643
At present, under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome, decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity.	0.6930773373684701
I believe that this proposal should remain, as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the European Union.	0.8678181286779837
I support the enlargement of the European Union.	0.6319572024184642
I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner.	0.7624293804867123
However, we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties.	0.9975886593370954
Changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping, otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed.	0.5879093423214408
Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members.	0.8033908093105372
President of the Commission, a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five-year plans.	0.6827417942842957
This is true, if we think of Russia' s plans in the thirties, but at the start of your mandate, a few months ago, you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would, however, be presenting a legislative programme, or rather, the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today.	1.0428150925749613
So, whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme, the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions, or rather a list of issues on the table. It does not, however, give us the impression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these points, but that it is just doing the European Commission' s duty.	1.0835288297546888
In this House, in the past, large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission, under its power of initiative, launched, not as experiments, but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress, but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union.	0.9507256239636416
In this case, Mr Prodi, we certainly have a kind of "Ten Commandments" : a whole raft of issues are listed, but if I may say so, we are left with the impression that the Commission is afraid to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points.	0.9958010531681672
There was only one point that you really stressed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease "unnecessary" activities.	0.8547637604085684
We should be careful, though, Mr Prodi, because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and backed this Commission - at least a parliamentary majority backed this Commission - precisely because, first and foremost, the reform of the Commission would bring consolidation, a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand.	0.9887221223041254
Let us consider the scenario whereby the Commission, not believing itself to be equal to the task, wishes, or proposes to shed, for example, its powers to implement common policies, which it is nevertheless accorded by the Treaty.	0.9132076477402322
What do we expect from a government in any case?	0.7611899929424598
What do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which is, so to speak, ambiguous and unique?	1.016119405537924
It is right for joint resources to be controlled supranationally and not to be delegated to the Member States or the TAOs, as has been the case in the past.	0.9888360926293707
It seems that you are proposing the same old menu, but with more unsatisfactory implications, restricting the Commission, so you say, to the task of drawing up a few White Papers, as you proposed.	1.064962313165635
My fear - even if you shake your head, Mr Prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years, that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers.	1.1389041647774598
If this is the role that the Commission intends to play over the next five years, we federalists are convinced, we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intends to do in this regard.	1.0417664516209928
The reform is important but, if it aggravates the situation, reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the Commission, then the structure of European integration, as planned by the founding fathers for the European Commission, will be at risk.	0.982217091199186
	-0.0
As for the other points, Mr Prodi, I will take economic and social policy as an example: the European social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve, but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past, without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that Europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective.	0.9630866597196869
If we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far, I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do.	0.8653851580578792
The same goes for enlargement as an end in itself, without it being linked to a reform to make the European Union and its structures much more efficient, and to proposals that the Commission could have made at the IGC.	1.0307479665143626
Mr Prodi, there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members, regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government.	0.9753912555796079
We approve of your position on this: you did well not to isolate that country any further.	0.6475816112634909
In any case, we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action.	0.7886145197602389
Mr Prodi, I repeat that this is, in our opinion, a slightly short-sighted view.	1.1325916838038204
Above all, it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned, for example, as regards the Balkans.	0.8743068880998179
Can we really continue to leave the Balkans out of the enlargement process, disregarding the fact that Croatia, Macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this House that is open to all?	0.8955149445551955
Madam President, Mr Prodi, I should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the Union' s activities and ask why, then, you are proposing a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation.	0.8636673515451019
I remember your predecessor' s speech five years ago.	0.49586236058606803
Like yourself, he promised "less and better" , but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered "much more and much worse" , and I do not believe that you, either, can deliver the goods you promise.	0.8297643053901236
You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation.	0.24943415968403376
The legislative programme is, in fact, a litany of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which, Mr Prodi, you are to take influence away from the people, even on social questions.	0.9472872061604619
You talk about greater transparency, but produce proposals which would lead to documents which, at present, are available for public inspection being locked away.	0.8195643994986159
Your Commission consists of the only 20 people in the EU who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced.	0.7023709242697191
Local politicians cannot do that, once legislation has been passed in Brussels.	0.7047936532326896
The legislative programme from the Commission ought at least, therefore, to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the Member States and to the processes of popular democracy. Otherwise, the number of laws produced in Brussels will just keep on growing.	0.861134675145957
We have passed 10 000 laws and as many amendments, and the applicant States have had 26 000 documents sent to them which, as debated by the Polish parliament, fill 140 000 sides of paper.	0.7421715615044621
Even by this stage, that is already too many by far.	0.7215540238488088
Brussels should make decisions on fewer matters and hand over more decisions to the people, the regions and the Member States. The only decisions which should remain with Brussels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legislate on effectively.	0.9362980012705311
What is more, the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent, so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process, now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them.	0.7549071606879071
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell' Alba' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of. Take a look at Jean Monet' s memoirs.	0.754126820997078
What he envisaged was what he called a small, practical secretariat.	0.44811811401029544
That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today.	0.7302078485362721
Madam President, this morning the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years, laudable aims indeed, to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world: succeeding with enlargement, meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe, introducing better principles of governance.	0.9032133886741811
We accept that Europeans, particularly the younger generation, need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead.	0.9255388730107096
But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high?	0.7323308640291172
We need to match this vision with reality.	0.45565743878349924
Here there are three elements I would like to contribute.	0.5749704454700715
Firstly, we need a successful European economy.	1.0344472387810124
We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across Europe, confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation, encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet, show that e-Europe is a good initiative.	0.7022258150498729
But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation, stifling individual initiative and enterprise.	0.5875311865454897
We must not fear globalisation, but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society.	0.9304850193261288
Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead, particularly of enlargement.	0.7075281050413806
Secondly, we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity.	0.840295109546977
Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too.	0.9336012798222968
We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation.	0.717811074371155
Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to go in a different direction.	0.7888733019262163
We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes.	0.7282110621104878
Lastly, we need to ensure that there is proper, genuine reform of the European Commission.	1.0329301384109775
Yes, the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body, but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament.	1.1681193335309286
The information problem, which Mr Bonde just referred to, is treated like a straw in the wind, with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us, as citizens and as parliamentarians, although we have the right to it under the Treaties.	0.9068652237562913
The Commission is not in fact today a European government.	0.996370515377556
The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament.	0.6615832876182723
We in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe.	0.7540288129514076
This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union, has its relevant role to play.	0.8949564930049481
Therefore we need to have credibility, coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens.	0.8523856046893332
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union, from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy; even to the response by the 14, the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria.	1.0892094369124687
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions.	0.5771892683377507
Nonetheless, I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission, that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge, inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which, to put it mildly, have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent.	0.9781964617686139
That does not apply to Austria alone.	0.5079635115008193
The Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria.	0.6988150305322327
However, the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and, in the final analysis, represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens.	0.8737237480015819
When it comes down to it, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough.	0.8125317384924106
In this sense, the Commission must insist, and I should like to endorse and confirm this here, that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding, enforceable rights.	1.0129148635586722
In this sense, the Commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom, security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speakers.	0.8881404790544916
Only reasonable, feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational, misleading and demagogic allegations of the extreme right.	0.3826933491227163
But, and I would like to stress this, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment, marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-European, nationalistic actions and reactions.	0.8452468430474124
In this respect, Mr President of the Commission, I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population.	0.8682916024820353
The feeling of being at the mercy of others, of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote, as in the European elections and, in the worst case scenario, to extremist voting patterns.	0.9064328689962682
The Union, like everyone else, has not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation.	0.9679987086661505
We are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house.	0.7018870296136623
What we need are not just reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the economic architecture - and, significantly, the President of the Commission forgot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture; we also need confidence-building measures for our citizens, who rightly expect help and support from and in the EU with the inevitable and painful process of adapting to new global circumstances.	0.9485810009366344
In this respect, what the Commission says about boosting Europe' s voice is important.	0.8103061677604196
You yourself, Mr President, spoke of a model of which, unfortunately, there is little mention in the document. You said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural and ecological development, both internally and towards the outside world, which differs from other models, including the US model.	0.9616985330118573
In this sense, the USA is not only our partner; it is also our competitor; not our opponent, our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model.	0.8085284984035103
I hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the Commission documents.	0.966686859057157
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the greatest legacy which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help resettle and redistribute the increasingly jumbled and confused powers and competences of the Commission, and perhaps of the Union itself.	0.9123184064616947
You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called "core tasks".	0.6297598061363284
That, as you have said yourself today, means that you must also identify tasks, policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission's main vocation.	0.9859587781804638
Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date, or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at European level.	0.5875711531265787
The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national, regional and local government.	0.6320937203536187
If we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical European public of the merits of further European integration, we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted EU powers as we are in the evolution of new EU powers.	0.8251571586744687
We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim, as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde, that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only.	0.9670242880723573
It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes, which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality, are devolved and repealed.	0.9636777061404002
If you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead, you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and, as we have heard today, you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament.	1.1046427200034123
Madam President, you spoke about fundamental political values, and one of the fundamental political values, even more important than democracy, is respect for others.	1.1242594048981083
We therefore feel that you acted correctly in sending a message and that perhaps those who protested about it are still feeling the effects of Bolshevism or Nazism. Democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong, but also listening to their explanations.	0.6159227448928944
Enlargement - and Alleanza Nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this House - must not mean dilution, that is, it must not entail more risks.	0.9566403258204256
The applicant countries' hopes are at least as important as the hopes of our current fellow citizens, who are beginning to feel bitterly disappointed by the way Europe works, as it is not resolving the most serious problems.	0.9053851927465392
We therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be redrafted with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in Romania, reaching as far as Belgrade, but above all, the continuing spread of apathy as regards major security issues.	0.7493811724056457
Even today, we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics.	0.7426704652615596
We therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement, so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions, with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur.	0.7761237238077987
I would also like to say a few words on Africa, Madam President.	0.6351157702425695
The third and fourth worlds have been abandoned: just one dollar, one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children.	0.7844283481383514
Europe, which is so democratic, so progressive, does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board, while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases.	0.7844162846453887
One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation.	0.45784826962851344
Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification, just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm.	0.6715378476526355
The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few.	0.5161088650094204
As for the Internet, Europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules.	0.9912769421698302
On a personal note, please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who, by acting the way they are, are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated.	0.9151287862219533
We live in a world of rules and regulations: let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future.	0.7238635371258263
Madam President, as a Padanian taxpayer, I have already experienced the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Prodi, since Padania is liable to Italy for its taxes as well.	0.833127918981845
Listening to him just now, I was concerned when he mentioned new resources, something that readily translates as additional taxation, in view, inter alia, of enlargement, that is the entry of new States into the Union.	0.9241434772655721
But why do they not buy their own entrance ticket?	0.3773016853443188
My Padanian electorate who, thanks to Mr Prodi, have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention, thanks once again to Mr Prodi, of paying another tax for someone else.	0.8338371109294481
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Members of the Commission, five months after its coming into office, the Commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the European Union.	0.831383688051118
The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic.	0.2888022697140482
Is it not rather melodramatic to say that "the world looks up to Europe" ?	0.8651763012511416
Moreover, Europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen EU Member States.	0.8775438423880406
It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace, democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe, no less?	0.9643516789355884
I am particularly intrigued by how the Commission considers bringing this about.	0.7434476781673479
Does "the European integration model as a rich source for global administration" imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power?	0.6307117330611546
According to the Commission, external policy can succeed, provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge!	0.7720090696380146
So who is this then?	0.3006958691328357
The Commission as a whole, its President perhaps, the Council?	1.0533707698124652
You stated that the new European government requires strong institutions, while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks.	0.8856642955878742
We could not agree more with the latter.	0.4502083964700673
It is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross-border issues and stopped decking out the European cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities.	0.5451350525469715
The document mentions common values on different occasions.	0.34219127732377264
Unfortunately, I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking.	0.9566484966292529
This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on.	0.6297817727906811
I am convinced that the Bible, God' s word, is the only pure source of proper standards and real values.	0.6789189904244475
In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition.	0.7985729213099949
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by: the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010?	0.8004851279023039
Have you already included your second term of office?	0.4083311593211686
But seriously.	-0.0
As it enlarges, the Union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation.	0.844917757700151
First, streamlining.	0.3087733717446103
What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning.	0.9593773767580842
The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy.	0.7704527335312813
In other words, a social, ecologically-orientated market, a secure currency, guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally.	0.6500353705037065
It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important.	1.2265097342843843
Secondly, the new "in" word is flexibility.	0.8937566531817135
However, increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation.	0.5335240997643237
We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States.	0.4304259171877487
That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society, which is a welcome step.	0.8097604893937194
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers.	0.4926536675576746
(Applause)	-0.0
Transparency does not mean more access to more paper; to our citizens, transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg, when and with what right.	0.867884391381127
That is transparency.	0.16961834761827216
Thirdly, the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly.	0.8545809074433554
Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join, but by how many countries it can accommodate.	0.6919463312114849
(Applause)	-0.0
If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union, then it must not be paid.	1.0208733017409566
It is too high a price, not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union.	0.979158902911977
There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone.	0.6260261084846894
But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies.	1.0240699834701632
That goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new, better quality of life.	0.672009918175708
Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together.	1.184387228805406
In doing so, we need, no less, to reinvent the European Union, but without destroying the present Union.	1.0041526613739782
(Applause)	-0.0
Madam President, in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement.	1.1208680972572629
The Commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union as soon as possible.	0.6940940704379894
On the other hand, we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down.	0.7089565141044105
To avoid this the European Liberal Democrats have expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric Union, in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring.	0.7706352320277201
It is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC.	1.1188801304387002
The subject needs to be discussed without prejudice.	0.5677205118722214
A technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough: we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by Jacques Delors, for example.	0.9149474847549541
In this way, a decision-making system can be created that is more effective, clearer, more open and more democratic.	0.7509759309778216
I hope that the Commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding Union might implement its institutional and other differentiation.	0.7225513210924056
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, your inspiring speech, Mr Prodi, has quite won me over.	0.7718286487202216
It raises expectations, but it can also lead to disappointment.	0.8541278797832728
This is connected to what Mr Van Velzen was just saying, about the difference between words and deeds.	0.7351434711413083
The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace, security and stability.	0.7839917902266982
You are looking to reassure the acceding countries, as well as European opinion.	0.6407118095169821
But these days, we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes.	0.6972851950853854
We have noted increasing levels of apprehension and disquiet, even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high.	0.5303302419357443
We need to make our citizens feel at home, according to Mr Swoboda, and I agree.	1.0116144681609656
This is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility.	0.7696436903002131
This is probably linked to the standards mentioned by Mr Van Dam, namely subsidiarity.	0.8891571505617314
It is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners, rather than competitors when it comes to policy.	0.7464709789037762
It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens, where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves.	0.9167115862612166
That will require a new political culture, not only in words, but also in practice, which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions.	1.1480588425276514
Regions which, culturally and economically, sometimes match the interest of some Member States.	0.5990260618455329
The new Europe should not only expand horizontally, but also vertically, by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community.	0.8870581142470717
This is what the Commission will be judged on.	1.303292111895709
Madam President, the Commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000-2005. These are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been glossed over to prevent any conflict.	0.9168299478956936
So, in the first part on the new forms of European governance, the words 'federalism' and 'superstate' are not mentioned at all.	0.9576851930620344
Yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong European institutions in which only day-to-day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an indistinct whole. In this scenario the governments and national parliaments are merged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society, all of which are described, with no form of hierarchy, as 'integral elements of European governance' .	0.8350380781883607
These ambiguities mask many misunderstandings, primarily about our values.	0.40176048189202046
It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat.	1.0064300445589538
It must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate, fair and transparent democratic debate, namely at national level in the main.	0.8143721622399144
Yet the whole of the Commission communication is based on the opposite theory. In this theory, on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples, their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations, new policies or new, restrictive legal structures such as the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.8512370000352572
This Charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights.	0.5164217793480679
In the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principles are rather different.	0.5239539389587875
Clearly we want to defend the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations.	0.8711668630967766
This is not impossible.	0.7812664442395321
We must move away from the outmoded federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on European matters comes from the Memoires of Jean Monnet.	0.4294095430022317
Instead, we must open the European institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations.	0.859795287059817
This is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication, Mr Prodi, but which is unfortunately not there.	1.0425477499106175
Madam President, Mr Prodi, you claim to be shaping a new Europe yet you are lacking one basic element: confidence.	0.6696071154498092
The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this.	0.45215796104308154
And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption?	0.48040139631015877
You are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty, insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency.	0.5548720614931635
You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders. Consequently, you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration.	0.6245147146228296
You are now proposing to give all decision-making power to a handful of officials. The Member States, local authorities and NGOs will simply become enforcers of decisions handed down from above, all on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels.	0.6902697131297796
Not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people.	0.6257516028602615
Clearly, they have no role to play in your strategy.	0.9081501462916542
You dare not even call a spade a spade, but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term 'governance' for what is nothing more than federal, autocratic, centralised government.	0.5479816686338282
Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty, you are now revealing your ultimate goal. You intend to trade in all European sovereignty, whether national or collective, for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position.	0.855607116042642
Finally, you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians, or are allowing this to happen, just because the result does not suit you.	0.750812048002066
Yet at the same time you are supporting Communist China and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades.	0.6177536592112394
Members of this House are today speaking out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel which, quite obviously, is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre.	0.8601422773371246
Your sabre-rattling fools no one because, as you know perfectly well, whether you like it or not, you need Austria in order to reform the Treaties and harmonise savings tax.	0.7963002337429117
You will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union.	0.6301149459416897
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this.	0.4425630822904301
The governments which, through spinelessness or ideology, support you are also responsible.	0.7923414924381743
Brussels is not all of us, as you claim. It is all of you.	1.0747040619711767
Tell the truth for once. You could not care less what the people of Europe want.	0.7245576165079075
They are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement.	0.4452195572721122
It is over ten years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the gulags and mollifying moralism.	0.43868703126271846
We were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship.	0.3262240612523111
We are and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship. We call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous projects.	0.8882615621194253
The salvation of European democracies is with nation states. Europe' s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of Europe.	0.6688300603428727
(Limited applause)	0.07180619683101806
President Prodi, today you have presented the Commission' s five-year programme, and it has many objectives that we endorse.	0.9372904182654873
It is a programme based on real-life situations and issues, and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues.	0.9138663321793293
In my view, Mr Prodi, judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us, one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance, and that is solidarity, not so much at international level as at internal level.	0.9423372236743113
The Archbishop of Milan, Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini, is calling upon all politicians, in particular those like you and me, President Prodi, for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of Catholics in politics, to reconsider a development process, which, in addition to economic profit, takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account.	0.7751752058300512
It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up, one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone.	0.897373314961616
It also reminds us of the need for a new growth model, one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the Catholics who are involved in social problems, who see, in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public, the most natural instruments for building solidarity.	0.9277889663661503
The fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom, which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced.	0.9163617202603288
This social freedom, which becomes manifest in initiatives favouring the poor, gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability.	0.7407256234240407
Mr President, public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion.	0.8129546620846139
They must focus on service to people and commitment to achieving freedom for each individual, without forgetting, naturally, that all this cannot and must not conflict with the need to create business, to invest and risk, and in an ordered and focused system, entrepreneurs are able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity.	0.8593612548869274
In the age of globalisation, which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers, the European Commission cannot forget solidarity, and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man.	0.9480181783617453
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart.	0.5353214399115532
We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice.	0.7647816377942702
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, 'Shaping the new Europe' is an ambitious objective both for the Commission and for us all.	0.9759533198924967
Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries, but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union.	0.9769286878770652
What sort of impression will an interested public, as well as the rest of the world, have of this five-year programme?	0.7040989041388996
My reply would be: a new start, a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the Union in the 2000s will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously.	0.8633364588060707
The Commission is correct in stating that the Union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation.	0.8273470207030317
It foresees a just and more effective Europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self-interest.	0.5082813027199194
Consequently, we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom.	0.8029715278374472
I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document. However, there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work.	0.7501845693958135
The first concerns women, gender and women's rights.	0.6564230933766697
You talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth.	0.4052286186515538
That is important, but equality is not only necessary for productivity, but also to make our societies more democratic.	0.9909052242391372
It is therefore noticeable that 'equality', 'gender' and 'women' are barely mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'.	0.6256987326500539
You mentioned 'women' in your speech, but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals.	0.9521508112411423
Is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women?	0.9071916550956078
What other explanation could there be for omitting women?	0.3206510106012814
The EU must not take on a masculine persona.	0.701048814112675
My other question concerns Africa, which is the only continent not mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'.	0.7569915899457524
Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world, the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic.	0.6874582724509843
I know that Commissioner Nielson and some of the other Commissioners are doing a fine job, but the rest of the Commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent, partly by including it among its strategic goals.	0.9289088435314369
Finally, I welcome the Commission's statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the EU is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets.	1.0041781119331321
I would merely ask when this is likely to take effect.	0.5396552940701739
Madam President, President of the Commission, this is a vital document for the future and fate of Europe.	0.9641292227556783
However, out of all the points, two specifically require our attention, and they are closely linked: peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe.	0.9341014237036444
It is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority.	0.731661759333602
For some time, we have all agreed on this notion, but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement, even if this comes at a price.	1.0205810038675414
Today, we have been called on to choose, for the forthcoming decades, between a Europe that might be less prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more wealthy, but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring.	0.9575264633741014
These goals will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference, which will draw to a close within the year, results in constitutional reform, providing the Commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement Council decisions or Parliament' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government.	0.8203595106943798
The first supporter of this reform should be Parliament itself, if it really wants to increase its role of interpreting the will of the Europeans and acquire the centrality which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated Union.	0.6700768408536809
Moreover, it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded.	1.004503659503644
Without these prospects that we have outlined, Europe would, once again, have no future.	0.8793308155012525
Madam President, Mr Prodi, we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which Europe must overcome.	0.9648588960825463
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century.	0.7408158600076282
This event must underpin enlargement.	0.1908299512208922
Rather than using the word 'enlargement' , I want to talk of reunification which has much greater political significance.	0.6517511187874608
Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks. This is one of the goals of your reform.	0.6630018587144665
In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity.	0.4091218460696169
Precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence.	0.6616719041039417
However, saying is one thing and doing is another!	0.6832434078260884
You must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers.	0.5847337696777484
I will therefore judge you on your deeds.	0.5355175036233244
In the meantime, I approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication.	0.6705779788246027
However, I must make two essential points. These concern the simplification and application of Community law.	0.9893575958032285
In 1998, 123 referrals were made to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and 25% of environmental directives were not applied or transposed.	0.5569070297694221
Recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential.	0.6189683235272176
Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic.	0.6986844239490948
The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this.	0.7320865724242211
You are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us, including unemployment.	0.8576852263423166
Nevertheless, I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed.	0.9205316461913934
The emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility.	0.6043033981310479
You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society, not only economically but also in terms of public health.	0.7178065532582977
This is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication.	0.8147373289058164
Finally, you do highlight European research as being at the heart of our future.	0.7897091671141209
Yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this.	0.5432481103464141
Also, ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these.	0.5513133287177272
If you want to better inform the people, you should start by strengthening liaison with this House, as we are the representatives of the citizens.	0.9757697493991342
Madam President, we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-year programme and of the programme for 2000, set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning.	1.0045695241300887
In the two documents, strong emphasis is placed on the need to define new forms of European governance and, to this end, to introduce a new agenda for the Commission, establishing more stringent priorities in the pursuit of the goal of full employment, through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policies of the States, and, primarily - allow me to stress this - of the nations that have joined the monetary union and which must be enabled to become the first example of closer cooperation.	0.8889367581101494
To this end, I shall confine myself to stressing, out of all the choices available, the importance of three priority decisions which should, in the drawing-up of action programmes for the government of the Union, be the basis for both the Commission' s agenda and the actions of the European Union in the coming months.	1.0213122218256427
Firstly, the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors, with the backing of the European Investment Bank.	0.9080363216773427
Secondly, the approval of investments - where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries via Community projects in the priority sectors of research, innovation and training.	0.8610669618675066
I feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature, resulting from investments in continuous training, refresher courses, adaptability and retraining of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives, that are always debatable, regarding new employment or employment cuts.	0.6979951782348107
If, among other things, as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well, the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue, focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge, in other words, a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules, this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes.	0.8557580917966755
Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life.	0.8318465977472873
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, you have come here today, Mr Prodi, in a very reformist and ambitious mood.	1.026659318273566
I welcome you and your ambition.	0.4681806073456638
Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us.	0.5153829343858984
In order to make these reforms, however, and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme, we must be very sure, not only of the strengths of the reformer himself, but also of the opinions of others.	1.0796403896309459
You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice.	1.1249436840143299
We have 1.27% of the Community' s GDP.	0.594588914661526
Not a euro more or a euro less.	0.3535864699099991
It will not be us who refuse these new resources. You should ask the Council.	0.883412106967195
These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre.	0.27301955753414947
In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans, we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4, and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget.	0.9661545225316801
I would remind you that this Group, the PPE-DE, does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones.	0.7273580366166239
The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs.	0.8018833024696542
Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system.	0.7724071114819051
It is all very well for us, by mutual consensus, to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation, but you must be very aware that the lack of resources, the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget, continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved.	0.9696758909218326
We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them.	0.9798322430539869
Madam President, the Commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever.	0.8288049322471509
On one hand, there are the words and, on the other, their real political meaning.	0.938703914091337
We Socialists applaud the Commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty.	0.7619938338489044
Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled?	0.5160375600840369
What is meant by the Commission' s declared objective of 'economic reform' in the labour market?	0.7009352587207751
Does this mean more flexibility, insecurity and fixed-term contracts?	0.4151730267361087
Everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth.	0.6030531534087976
The Union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient.	0.9186044195834947
We Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment.	0.33394279181130765
The ingredients of this policy are well known. They are the stimulation of public and private investment, increased investment in research, education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise.	0.8146636722560808
In this respect, the e-Europe initiative is to be welcomed.	0.7948915764008375
In the world of new technologies, the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are.	0.9767415930920934
The gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era.	0.5715928728029657
On one hand we have the exuberance of the financial markets and the explosion of wealth and, on the other, more widespread exclusion.	0.9849401755383133
We are asking workers to be flexible, innovative and ever more productive, yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone.	0.6243283010341374
The European Central Bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets, yet it never misses an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity.	0.5477727532826449
How do we explain to workers who fall victim to the rationalisations of the worldwide Monopoly game that they must be prepared to change career several times in their working lives when the captains of industry, having lost the gamble of a take-over, leave with compensation of EUR 30 million?	0.5483619547652664
For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised.	0.7789280545562491
The sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions, leading inevitably to monopoly situations.	0.5309429719823383
All these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15%, 20% or 25% which are unrealistic in the long term.	0.5976441529170755
The unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase.	0.6092174982886741
The main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets.	0.6909433471403988
To conclude, the next five years will be crucial.	0.7920436642402868
We need new rules to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people. We need the Member States and the Commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner.	1.1506097561733346
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, in my view, this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses.	0.7697554273665409
There is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one.	0.9098602026243278
I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy.	0.6427317471702952
You have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier, yet still you attach too little importance to these areas.	0.4983652863520969
And do you know why?	0.33365890201300785
Just look at transport policy; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries.	0.669162130008035
I would be grateful if the President of the Commission would listen to what I have to say, although of course he has no obligation to do so.	1.0248426118059561
Let me give you three examples.	0.2880118860735286
First: we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the roads to the railways.	0.6315566733667518
That makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view.	0.6791767858538843
Without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy.	0.5845420705712554
The same applies to European air traffic control.	0.3114945778511793
Our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic, but leaving 15 different sectors in the skies which are under national control, which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which pollute the environment.	0.8089754242047156
You still have not finished that agenda.	0.3929804604420783
Commissioner, far too little is said in your paper about regional policy.	0.6896046807219481
Economic and social cohesion in the EU is a fundamental task of this Community.	1.2070503616818458
If we fail to complete it, citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement.	0.4821293653348808
We must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means.	0.588077139625265
Then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it.	0.5764878826142097
Mr President of the Commission, if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions, then this Union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people.	0.9318418296967694
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage.	0.8492908247016286
From that standpoint, it is useful that the Commission' s work programme comes back to the issues of Agenda 2000, the common agricultural policy, which includes fishing, and secondly, the activities of the structural funds.	1.0387432098668263
I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000.	0.7113560106867638
The Agenda 2000 issues are, of course, ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives, the economic and social Agenda and a better quality of life.	0.6828633084290339
What your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major, high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deploy.	0.6156509990919697
I do not necessarily mean financial resources.	0.6068150883808927
The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money.	0.5518586507417762
There must also be savings.	0.4846769068459926
But what we need is the analytical resources: these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital.	0.6944876636012283
This is because it is essential to achieve two things: the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured, and this must be done in a way which facilitates the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products, mainly to the benefit of developing countries.	0.9960953619502434
It is not easy to combine those aims. There is no obvious way.	0.8910448393681991
There may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them.	0.9544513873163533
As regards the other aspect of Agenda, the aspect of cohesion and regional development, there we do indeed have great achievements to point to, but there are still less developed regions, particularly island regions, to which more attention should be paid.	1.021105711836463
As for fishing, there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the predatory exploitation of fishing grounds, which has gone as far as to wipe out entire species of fish, will certainly prove fruitful in the future.	0.8738328142271711
Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse.	0.46054941470957866
Madam President, I want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan.	0.7419324152222717
In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present.	0.7452703584870727
That was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group, Mr Poettering, in his opening address.	0.9448641900538131
The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place.	0.6571935157958925
That foundation is clearly the single market.	0.48037767877177384
How strongly is the single market established at the moment?	0.7249783839438052
I want to remind Mr Prodi, and his colleagues who are still here, of the findings of the Commission' s own survey among 3000 European businesses.	0.93776580688324
Nearly 40% of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications.	0.46969220862430744
This is the Commission' s own survey.	1.103813236339653
These are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments - bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry.	0.5305232576069313
The Commission' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market.	0.4754289157503853
We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers, intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and, of course, extending into crucial new areas like financial services.	0.6364251237345809
Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved.	0.6410729092932439
An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union.	0.5512113671472704
The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement.	0.6952769654640538
I conclude by saying, on behalf of all my Conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task.	1.08803166228294
Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today.	0.7325238563833033
The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme.	0.8199453914454834
From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance, which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens.	0.8508512198626507
Yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate, if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority.	0.9785398981927349
The interlinking of the EU institutions, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well.	0.921418629570274
Yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction?	0.5810429472866131
Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what' but more 'what are we doing together' ?	0.7003940701100458
It is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens.	0.48510390912353935
In your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us. I would add to these the future of our social model.	0.9860095524757513
This is why I and my group are so firmly insisting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.6185591711056948
The reason our timetable includes the drafting of this Charter is because we are at a key point in our history. Our Union needs to redefine the values on which it is based, both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire, but not under just any conditions.	0.8880062688287698
Our people expect more Europe, but not just any Europe.	0.8393592852579357
They are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather, on the basis of our social model, to be able to organise globalisation.	0.79034045676384
In this respect I must say that, in terms of your commitment to a political union, to which we are favourable, this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model, on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world.	1.029019773920645
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I should like to start with a quote: "The Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme.	0.8912844648735341
The Commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration. It wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime" .	0.9554057691573191
That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security, freedom, citizens' rights and judicial cooperation.	0.8421854912249088
A paper this short is a farce.	0.2578297526963164
A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand.	0.8089768392632684
A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard.	0.8438736989181973
It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard.	0.8386021842954169
We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme.	0.7956053622918031
What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand.	0.7585254437883807
We want instruments to prevent abuse.	0.31981061778427583
We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime.	0.8116302938467856
We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper.	0.8406282357170622
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation, on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group. This is not the case in other areas, as has already been pointed out.	1.0581600299589429
We share these views because we are in favour of world trade, but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards, common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind. This aim is that trade should benefit development, and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world' s most dynamic and competitive regions.	0.9146275706931113
On the other hand, what does this statement tell us about principles?	0.622914717726806
This regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation, in other words, increased wealth, but when we look at how this wealth is distributed, we see, unfortunately, that the gulf between the world' s richest countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase.	0.792459997976374
It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves, what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve?	0.7877628079527395
What good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation works, if they cause trade to increase on the one hand, but on the other, they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow?	0.8352534294075165
That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission outlined here for the Seattle negotiations and for later ones.	0.909510847484097
We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious.	0.8232821279318088
We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations.	0.7834465235920071
Most importantly though, we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform, not just of the WTO but also of the ILO, the United Nations and above all, of the financial institutions, specifically the IMF and the World Bank.	1.080500404143367
We must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation. We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process, so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries, but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world.	0.9606051483070365
Madam President, I would also like to welcome the Commission' s initiative of presenting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years, although I hope that it intends, in subsequent documents, to avoid the excess of generalisations and the vagueness of the text which we are examining today.	0.9317121056076711
Having said this, Madam President, I am prepared, once again, to be a voice crying in the wilderness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy.	0.8639515035605378
It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years, in view of the reform which must take place in 2002.	0.9646523302770229
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years.	0.9587043878199358
However, it seems that the Commission does not share this view, although it is the Commission which is obliged to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001, and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification.	1.2320375412326823
In fact, the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions, such as the European Parliament, which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy.	0.7732834338399625
We have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply.	0.8152016152680058
Less than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is anomalous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such anomalies should be resolved within the framework of this reform process.	0.7187931844829973
Therefore, Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I would ask that this issue, which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the European Union, be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years.	0.9637312252468779
Madam President, I should like to add my congratulations to Commissioner Prodi's programme.	0.7700916940049528
I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth: the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity, innovation enterprise, the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra-high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens.	0.6480434426630008
I have one observation, not a criticism, to make regarding Commissioner Prodi's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy.	1.1253039242164145
We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restructured.	0.9747690173673429
After all, what is social justice if it is without full employment?	0.7007844188684459
Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens.	0.6409395688656339
This is a key priority for us to focus on.	0.8646616922352423
I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us: in particular Commissioner Liikanen's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy.	0.9187059143279989
Yes, e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs.	0.8499922247107327
I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses.	0.8183496191648398
That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit.	0.7507627911588969
I also welcome Commissioner Busquin's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union.	0.7820663886597747
Again, this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity.	1.0288132626743345
You said in your summary, Commissioner Prodi, that liberalisation, competitiveness, keeping inflation low, innovation, science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs.	0.961906691756465
I very much agree with you on that, but we can take nothing for granted.	1.0231084008878684
There is still more we have to do, and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that.	1.1355019850692911
So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success.	0.7282234956099278
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme.	0.9117367225009473
To me, this Commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle.	0.7734965670172045
Unfortunately, it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission.	0.9146737949696313
As the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group, I would have expected more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission.	0.8222451606892002
The Commission gives no soul to Europe.	0.3342783562705305
Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper, despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe.	0.8014652271117285
Just a few main points.	0.46515787793851615
I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture; they create jobs.	0.9270295216398126
I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas, about consolidating and improving the European dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning.	0.6602389017259365
Mr President of the Commission, it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe.	0.7432883886226057
Nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens.	0.5125409887765052
It seems to me that something is missing from this programme.	0.7220080110891255
Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real, visible area of training and culture.	0.5208349160305875
Declarations of principle are not enough.	0.33248499455537095
We need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just described.	1.0151957172919854
Madam President, Mr Prodi, how would you take stock of your policy and work programme, what would your benchmark be, if you had to make direct choices?	0.9168946457155663
You have the fine, charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections, or rather the turnout at the next European elections.	0.8188706348188591
When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say?	1.0261880554207004
Mr Prodi, what can I say; what is there that is new?	0.7402869744334984
There is nothing new in your work programme.	0.7200784952802843
You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year' s work programme.	0.6639876558019058
Does that give me hope for the year 2000?	0.544635469035075
No, it does not!	0.8771905999499007
In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever.	0.5051266379076648
You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas.	0.6129024281272557
Have you done so, Mr Prodi; have you even read your work programme for the year?	0.8276523518124418
No, you have not done so.	1.1015301099154788
You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement, despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement.	0.88699749444645
Nor have you integrated it into economic policy, competition or the internal market.	0.6006295993424327
You have not integrated it anywhere.	0.6109132835479582
You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure.	0.43524717116524486
You said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure; no, Mr Prodi, we need, at long last, to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored.	0.922278112513051
You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation.	0.7005371740080255
Mr Prodi, you do not know what you are talking about.	1.0085363329351646
The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world.	0.9753436680548426
Where it falls short, what is missing, is transposition in the Member States and monitoring.	0.8803819060295661
It is time you took your job seriously, it is time for you, as President of the Commission, to box the Member States on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties.	0.9146353092915482
It is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day' s work to be done.	0.7898109445133252
That is what we expect of you in the next five years.	0.7753564666870475
.	-0.0
(ES) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, as chairman of this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries, Mr Prodi, you are not making things easy for me at all.	0.854494077125992
I feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us.	0.6319056419103005
The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change.	0.9536196360218588
I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing, since the silence of your programme, with regard to fishing, is deafening.	0.8909636379096346
Not a single line, nor a single word, refers to fishing or the CFP.	0.642923183484858
I am not asking for details or specific points, but I believe that a mention was required.	0.8590541848854771
How could you completely ignore a common - I repeat; common - policy with such an economic, social and regional impact, and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe?	0.9313261039176068
This is all the more serious, if that is possible - as others have said - bearing in mind that your Commission, Mr Prodi, has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy, which you are legally required to do in 2002.	1.0479649782390645
Does the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either?	0.7451578895358715
What message can we send to the fishermen of Europe, and their families, and the fishing industries, both the extractive and processing and marketing industries, and the related and secondary industries which depend on fishing in so many European ports, in so many European regions, in most cases peripheral regions, who rightly demand that this problem be dealt with as a priority?	0.9611477405695639
You have made an explicit reference to the CAP for the coming years, but you have not done so for the CFP, with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context, in the context of globalisation.	1.045708777937965
This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second.	1.1176004698023383
I would therefore ask you, Mr Prodi, to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today.	0.9902054723002678
Our parliamentary Group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you.	0.7126219410067016
Mr President of the Commission, this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament, a five-year programme following the crisis of the Commission.	0.8409254605212171
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to focus on the point of internal reform.	0.7353558195404682
We wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President, Mr Kinnock, on behalf of the Commission.	0.91571426444041
We consider it to be of utmost importance that, in terms of financial control, personnel management and bureaucratic short-cuts, we can expect swift lines of policy and a more effective bureaucracy, for the benefit of the citizen.	0.9293104281563463
At the same time, we are aware that this is a massive programme and that, during the overhaul in the next couple of years, it will be necessary to keep the actual results coming in, as before.	1.0141642782154137
Much like in the Netherlands, where, at a given point, women woke up to the fact that, by referring to European legislation, they could improve their status in terms of social security, this is now also the case for scores of other citizens.	1.0211617769714212
They want to see results.	0.6066038164653365
Democracy, transparency and clarity always lead to results, citizens value results and this is what the Commission is judged on.	0.8851811737571594
This is exactly the point which Mr Swoboda and also other Members made: fear of modernisation, globalisation, and the individual losing his own sense of safety and security.	0.7319295226790132
This can be prevented if a European social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas.	0.6592745657851813
I would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which delivers fast and concrete results at a social level. This gives the citizen a sense of recognition, here in Europe and elsewhere.	0.8405219653560394
Because this citizen - one in five globally - still has no access to elementary social provisions, such as education and health care.	0.6917511433284638
These are really the people who deserve our solidarity.	0.6685199679152214
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I have read and re-read the Commission' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office.	0.8571236615680686
I am delighted that it is being discussed in Parliament, but I also note the compromises and the omissions in it.	0.965185014779053
The Commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion, to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union' s regional policy.	0.8320660613889032
And this is true even when it addresses the issue of enlargement.	0.8202695799371008
Are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved?	0.784101745851466
Certainly not!	-0.0
At the same time, it was rightly pointed out that Europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with developing countries, and strengthen its activities designed for fighting poverty.	0.7541812365730257
This document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included.	0.5672302574565917
I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious.	0.8169177366836075
It plays down one of the Treaties' principles - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the European institutions' policies and measures. It seems to ignore the fact that various European regions are still considerably less advanced than others.	1.0997549565627045
It also forgets that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right. Unless we achieve real convergence, the cohesion of the European Union itself will be at risk.	0.9039125888820182
We should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union, for which the Commission is responsible.	1.2253400869215005
This report confirms that whereas an average level of development is given a rating of 100, the ten so-called "strongest" regions reached an average of 158, and the ten so-called "weakest" regions reached a figure of around 50.	0.6322416129352959
You may draw your own conclusions.	0.3107896295873624
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region, the Azores, one of the regions defined in the Treaties as ultra-peripheral.	0.8785316000286792
I am waiting for the Commission' s report on the ultra-peripheral regions, which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999.	0.9300800984397802
I shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion, there will be no cohesion at all, only disunity.	0.7318690780908524
Madam President, Mr Prodi, Europe needs a strong Commission.	0.8213308264217071
As intended by the Treaties and the will of the people, the Commission is the driving force of European construction which is like a rock of Sisyphus which we have to push back up to the summit again together after each round of enlargement. We therefore need a strong Commission but one which relies on the support of a parliament.	0.9348334059099377
This House is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommodating. You must therefore listen to our opinions, one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech.	0.9048032117211486
Firstly, Mr President, although your two predecessors concentrated on developing an internal market and establishing the single currency, it has been left to you to develop this whole value of citizenship which is at the heart of European construction.	0.884134799529427
You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement, however important this may be.	0.7630208443565389
You must go further, towards reconciling the people with Europe, in particular those people who are falling victim to economic, social and, probably, in the future, technological divisions.	1.0111088965520691
The promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition. The latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health, education, transport, communications, water and whatever else.	0.8333715671911228
Your action programme and your objectives are reserved, even silent, specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed.	0.6844120473807443
This is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services.	0.856572744834498
This is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than Jörg Haider.	0.9221290421813441
Madam President, the Commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities.	0.8941596405732982
The recent dioxin scare in Belgium, prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain, and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically-modified foods, have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat.	0.7545560806982107
If the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of EU citizens.	0.8385083484221075
I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety, public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the Commission's work programme for 2000.	0.8899314317597136
However, I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper.	1.126231335196498
In its present form, what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision- and law-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration, which has already established credibility in this particular field.	0.9264269437474372
Furthermore, future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States, for example the food safety authority in Ireland.	0.7977362710832008
This body, for example, alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety, is already doing good work.	0.6467529575912954
It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation.	0.6231942248698958
My fear is that such deficiencies in EU legislation could lead to turf wars between national and EU bodies, who should be working together rather than against one another.	0.6541542588016308
That is something we must guard against.	0.645836314362295
Madam President, the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair.	0.6005090984119273
We will be looking for the detail year by year, for example in the social action programme to be unveiled this year.	0.919442187640656
We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy, and will be applying a number of tests.	1.0285330875797365
We will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combining economic policy, employment policy and social policy.	0.8873306333123557
At the moment, social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy.	0.7343090244124884
Within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the Portuguese Presidency.	0.7499154996072757
Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect.	0.8938488720548019
The spate of mergers, takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive.	0.9396282633302458
We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change.	0.6603391355980128
That is the successful way to manage change, and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place.	1.1057008745216406
Finally, with the emergence, the resurgence, of the xenophobic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination, and Article 137 to combat exclusion.	0.8421126328753972
We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now.	0.5485978381899911
The aspirations are fine, President Prodi, we want those aspirations to be matched by action.	0.769777727628765
Madam President, I hope that it is a good omen that there are still a few i's left for me to dot.	1.1312903369207332
Mr Prodi, you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forward-looking employment policy throughout Europe.	0.532314125235635
However, for the economic sector which I represent, i.e. fisheries, this means change.	1.0497708876167577
We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility.	0.5498995174619951
We must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry.	0.4732598113831059
What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing.	0.8674936647883545
However, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor, which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe.	0.9558212795250731
Plus, this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which Europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act, which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too.	0.9600629772158688
This has since been unanimously approved.	0.37070550092418547
The fisheries policy is due for review in a few months' time, i.e. at the beginning of the year 2000.	0.7332000270932235
So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper.	0.8599510001266606
I hope that this is a misunderstanding.	1.081733606528167
Please, Mr Prodi, stand by your word and implement your promises.	0.571422093510502
Madam President, many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission' s statement.	0.8381580324458998
However, we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission.	1.031214012121353
One area that I want to focus on, in addition to those already identified, is that of cultural diversity in Europe.	1.0344304907696857
The introduction to this statement acknowledges under the quality of life section that it is important.	0.8222725787157481
But there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the Commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity.	0.8595529788337996
If we are to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other, both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and, indeed, among those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe.	0.9061398346619446
Unless we address these issues, unless we dismantle these negative stereotypes, unless we take what is best from our various cultures and languages and protect and expand it and ensure that we are serious about having a diverse Europe, we will fail.	0.7697165395976276
Those who are currently coming to the fore in Europe based on fear will win the day.	0.622214138448832
I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe, we will make progress on the economic front, on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy, but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand.	0.8895067644982035
If we do not take steps to deal with that, we will fail ultimately.	1.0448699373252268
Thank you, Mr De Rossa.	0.7925818642297209
Before giving the floor again to the President of the Commission, I must tell you that I have received, pursuant to Rule 37, seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate.	0.9028105651155792
Welcome	-0.0
I would like to inform you that there is a delegation from Kuwait, led by His Excellency, Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah, Vice-Prime Minister and Defence Minister, here in the official gallery.	0.6499605915357901
On behalf of the House, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament.	0.9834150416894976
Mr President, I should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activities organised today by the Association of Parliamentary Assistants in support of their call for a statute for assistants to be adopted as soon as possible.	0.7549592587279572
I understand that on 26 January the association wrote to the College of Quaestors requesting permission to set up a table outside the Hemicycle today to publicise their initiative.	0.5646342742495108
On the same day, I understand, Mr Balfe gave permission for the assistants to go ahead.	0.970196789381937
The Parliament services asked to meet with the assistants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements.	0.6690498340788068
However, the appointment was cancelled at the last minute.	0.8095767990435775
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn.	0.5412760737456469
Mrs Banotti apparently promised to write a letter explaining why permission was withdrawn but so far no letter has been received.	0.37021015406601804
Can you explain why the approval given to the assistants was withdrawn at the last minute?	0.6031099916330609
Do you agree that the assistants have a legitimate case which must be heard?	0.5621272153976972
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last-minute cancellations do not happen again?	0.5195075565415882
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible?	0.6091302610889328
Finally, will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament's rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid, as they should be, on the basis of all the work they do for us?	1.0725286055952081
Without them we would not be able to function.	0.7176294270239703
Mr President, I also rise on a point of order.	0.8096943161052335
Are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this Parliament, outside the doors of the Hemicycle, to ensure that MEPs are free to come into this Hemicycle to discharge their mandate?	0.66972938768518
If there are such rules, who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility?	0.7930183773192373
Mr President, I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants, which we have always considered to be a priority, and inform you that - as the Italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader, Mr Barón Crespo, we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the Quaestors.	1.108051973783353
I think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway.	1.0565361665677202
I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise.	0.910585351107292
Mr President, first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants.	0.9694958688129482
Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament.	0.43549888130447106
As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament.	0.8119795784653121
To give a non-contentious example, no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons.	0.717217282730254
Following a letter I received yesterday, I immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration, probably in the near future and possibly in the next month.	0.7989429042247572
But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament.	0.6487979749149652
I signed a letter yesterday afternoon, in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament, in which the assistants were informed of this.	0.8511915337938887
But I am also told that they were informed verbally of this decision by the Committee of Chairmen of Groups last Thursday, so they were fully aware of the decision.	0.9061241249297565
There is no problem with them telling us the way they feel, there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament's next part-session.	0.7387823578748857
But there was some misunderstanding, for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission.	0.6643602873157242
But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee.	0.5410616568083083
As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament, whether they be about different countries or whatever.	0.7392283922269884
This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants.	0.993278542076275
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.	0.816238964085014
I think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised.	0.39834742765337117
Mr President, I wanted to point out an important matter of principle.	0.9163686419359731
I personally believe that it is nothing short of scandalous that we hear Members of this Parliament attacking the demonstration rather than looking at the solution to the problem, which is fair conditions, fair pay and fair hours.	0.7700715247836064
We shall now proceed to the vote.1	0.4593586100661163
VOTE	-0.0
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party, the delegation of the Spanish People' s Party, with regard to Mrs Terrón i Cusí' s resolution on the area of freedom, security and justice.	0.7667993914148193
There have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the Group of the European People' s Party, and we have voted in favour of the Terrón i Cusí resolution, which we consider on the whole to be excellent.	0.9430519470661634
However, we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6, because they seem to us to be legally incorrect.	1.020745363019025
On the other hand, we have voted in favour of Recital J which, in fact, is in line with what I, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, proposed to that Committee, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.9016312084137122
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13.	0.5609240668936722
An appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non-EU countries is something which the Spanish People' s Party has been advocating for some time.	0.7685933143051338
For similar reasons, we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which, with the oral amendment, dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity, since political rights, not just voting in local elections, but political rights in general terms, form part of the sovereignty of Member States.	0.8051928264375584
Given the oral amendment, we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done.	1.1967466707626886
.	-0.0
(DA) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the proposed resolution, but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas clash with the reservation Denmark has in the legal sphere - a reservation which the Danish delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists naturally wishes to respect.	0.8394740835125337
This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with 'communitisation' or the consolidation of Fortress Europe.	0.5786781107220912
The supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants.	0.5127916290960941
In terms of human rights, this is a backward step.	0.816309577140292
Europe is continuing to expel nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Yet some applicant countries in central and eastern Europe are taking in gypsy refugees expelled en masse from Belgium.	0.5727294301022572
Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status, whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution.	0.4475893944467473
The Europe of Schengen clearly finds it much easier to hound the persecuted from the south than dictators, even though the UN estimates that we will need 159 million immigrants to maintain a stable population between now and the year 2025.	0.6906578364682211
Europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections. Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice.	0.8627695118619145
McCarthy report (A5-0026/2000)	0.31089868061819653
Mr President, I would firstly like to point out that I was Mayor of Bilbao during the nineties, which gave me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot projects to be subsidised by the Commission.	0.8239267701212399
Our experience with that pilot project in Bilbao led us to four conclusions: firstly, that Europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore, far from reducing the EUR 900 million for the last five year period to EUR 700 million for this five year period, the funding of this project should be increased. This should be done, for example - and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has proposed this - by reinvesting, in URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which each Member State has not spent within the time scales laid down for that purpose.	0.8507100061827843
Secondly, when deciding which areas must be subsidised, we must concentrate efforts on integrated projects.	0.9264708668437164
Disparate actions are not effective.	0.2415037865528236
We have to select locations by prioritising those which are most impoverished and needy, in accordance with the objectives set, that is to say, the social, economic, environmental and democratic management dimensions, as well as the relationship between them.	0.884001090828739
Thirdly, we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other Community programmes, as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question.	0.9055769798488861
Finally, we have to put our trust in, and support, the institutions which are closest to the citizens, that is, the local councils and bodies.	1.1667819060863989
They have more first-hand knowledge of social needs. They have more involvement in the problems and, furthermore, they know how to conceive projects and implement them effectively without weighing them down with bureaucracy, and thereby achieve better results.	0.8328983912224588
Lastly, in today' s vote on our four amendments, two have been approved and the other two rejected.	0.927587387200148
This has obliged us to abstain from the final vote, because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedicate, to URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which it has not spent in accordance with Community programmes.	0.8641094578758479
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had an in-depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produced many ideas.	0.7091766381215738
As the smallest Community initiative in existence, we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected.	0.7789219764290854
We regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects. We should remember that it is these URBAN projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established.	0.7833271985324264
The Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place. It should make URBAN projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled 'sustainable urban policy' .	0.8939808940675213
Finally, there is currently still no European urban policy within the European Union. Perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reorganisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally has a true urban policy.	0.8165181233669089
Mr President, I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development, known as URBAN.	0.7952692941544209
As with all other Community initiatives, this is very positive.	0.9541155801908808
Europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State, whichever one it may be.	0.8898805263763001
URBAN is designed to find solutions to urban decay, and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pensioners' Party.	0.7610988144711759
There can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city.	0.5327946905384684
I hope that this Community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities.	0.798438409314884
. (DA) The Left' s five Members of the European Parliament have chosen to support LEADER+, the EQUAL initiative and INTERREG, but not URBAN.	0.9631570114169402
At a forthcoming review of these programmes, it ought to be established that the EU' s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross-border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the EU.	0.8836798807085281
. (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for a Community initiative relating to the economic and social regeneration of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis and designed to promote sustainable development (URBAN).	0.7699072212087071
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think, in general, that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations, as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects.	0.9301840562999121
This report contains general points on what is referred to as the urban regeneration strategy for town centres and neighbourhoods affected by the crisis in the capitalist economy and its consequences, i.e. increasing unemployment, exclusion and delinquency.	0.6062768527891007
It underlines the fact that, in order to ensure sustainable urban development, an urban policy must be implemented which does not leave out the main victims of the economic crisis, namely the unemployed, immigrants, refugees, women and the socially excluded.	0.8735520888678485
However, nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it.	0.7790740372221707
At best this report simply corrects certain aspects and effects of the crisis. Yet only scandalously limited resources are available for this work.	0.6507031666928398
As the report itself indicates, the funds allocated to the URBAN II programme for the 2000-2006 period are approximately 30% less than those in the previous period, which were already low, at EUR 900 million. Added to this is the fact that only about fifty projects are considered for the whole of Europe which is pathetic when practically all European city districts, both suburban and inner city, are affected.	0.9087057534933961
This is why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measures planned to help certain social categories which are most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consists of pious hopes financed on the cheap.	0.7471131865189463
- (FR) Mrs McCarthy, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that the URBAN Community Initiative is being continued as this aims to support the social and economic conversion of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis, all with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	0.7440088393466893
With some 80% of the population of Europe living in an urban area, cities are at the forefront of economic, social and cultural change in Europe.	0.7512904150760296
At the same time, the social and economic problems facing European society are more pronounced in urban areas.	0.6596322752240878
Many European cities are divided into neighbourhoods characterised by high-added-value activities and high-income residents and other districts characterised by low incomes, high unemployment, substandard and overcrowded housing and high levels of welfare dependency.	0.4756395322534573
The concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved.	0.6616678538151262
This is why the European Parliament successfully called for the URBAN Community Initiative or CIP to be extended during the reform of the Structural Funds.	0.8064916918877519
The success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period is indisputable.	0.42750899958330424
The results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas.	0.9030621235159298
This CIP has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic, social and environmental sectors.	0.6748076753769581
It has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities, the non-governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration.	0.7623766667546601
The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them, while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups.	0.5411956188480435
We can therefore welcome its adoption.	0.4697336001300298
We must, however, admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory!	0.4558746535088385
The total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge.	0.5361019427566774
The amount for the 1994-1999 period was EUR 900 million and will be EUR 700 million for the 2000-2006 period. This represents a drop of 30%!	0.6393228866732401
This reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new URBAN initiative.	0.7203270434803177
The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low.	0.2528022525495899
It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States.	0.5614922201091905
In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects, the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect.	0.8599858231508197
The McCarthy report on the URBAN Community Initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in urban matters.	0.6267046146634658
The situation of certain urban areas is alarming, with the social distress taking the form of unemployment, misery and crime.	0.6824843424227893
Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency.	0.24801490478312063
Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt.	0.7909813843619048
Subsidiarity should make us realise that the state, exercising its governing functions, and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately. The state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people.	0.8069289601136623
Although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchanges between successful enterprises, the problems specific to each urban area cannot be dealt with in the same way.	0.760536760451259
The URBAN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union' s desire to communitise urban policy.	0.6503333684871194
It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-existing European policies.	0.9183634768521296
Clearly some people are profiting from the opportunity to indulge in another budget bidding race which is particularly mistimed when the convergence criteria for EMU are imposing a very strict slimming regime on the national budgets.	0.44270133662671407
Mrs McCarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extolling the benefits of a federal Europe.	0.6204462272591955
We should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project.	0.5655590181059561
In fact, the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted.	0.526943964421459
The aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility.	0.9092714981553778
Finally, the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or sociological minorities.	0.804072475469273
We can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion.	0.5851143845466702
On one hand, this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their assimilation into the culture of the host country. This would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder kegs.	0.7827786186168088
On the other hand, it manipulates the principle of positive discrimination. This is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful, as shown by the US precedent.	0.892786634963681
For all these reasons, the French delegation of the UEN Group could not approve the McCarthy report.	0.7133718296843357
Decourrière report (A5-0028/2000)	0.28613226415845033
Mr President, the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts.	0.8719664320301614
Like many of my colleagues, I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to safeguard this initiative.	1.0889942389289284
As I live in the Sarre-Lor-Lux Sud region of Belgium, I am well aware that the regions are where Europe is being created. They are where we live the European experience on a daily basis and where the people make European construction come alive.	0.7586931812700898
These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development.	0.5661764825313041
Why am I stressing this point?	0.2528891235680505
The answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted.	0.8705550741271959
For example, to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the European Union. This goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions, for example.	0.9508129354141005
I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the EU' s policy is integrated into the projects submitted and that the goal of reducing CO2 for example forms an experimental added value in the projects proposed.	0.7954201777080109
I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction.	0.8233927819038944
We know that some Member States are still wavering, for example, between rail and road for routes through vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees, as in the Aspe valley.	0.799959962847503
However, I am also thinking of my own region where my government is still debating whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway, the A32.	0.8394235362766083
In this respect too, I would ask the Commission to be particularly attentive about ensuring that there is real cohesion between the various policies, specifically in the INTERREG programmes which are being submitted.	1.13276424495616
Mr President, I voted for the Decourrière report on the Community initiative INTERREG, mainly because of the reply Commissioner Barnier gave to some Members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime frontiers. I voted for it, not just because I was born in a coastal town, Genoa, but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too.	0.8171166102362527
These frontiers stretch as far as African states and the Middle East: we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of Europe.	0.8850667279374923
As an MEP from a border region, I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest.	0.9199943347818142
We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically, socially and culturally.	0.6362002694919617
Due to the existence of these borders, they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong. This has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy.	0.9019430549813399
This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990.	0.7184529309242894
This programme was designed to encourage cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union.	0.7598541547355562
INTERREG serves principally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs, education and training, cultural exchanges, action to combat health problems, the protection and improvement of the environment, energy, transport and telecommunications networks.	0.7785031991980078
I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration.	0.7515084874595032
More active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be promoted, bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border.	0.7113621245921075
In cross-border cooperation, greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators.	0.8143613183459217
In the same respect, given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50% of all unemployment, the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment.	0.8439360430471919
Obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing, braking or hindering cross-border mobility.	0.4636227729081223
I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region!	0.9535795229383434
INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area.	0.7633370258754651
Finally, and in particular, expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTERREG!	0.7117604382678365
The challenges are therefore immense. The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy!	1.0440489619263926
I hope everyone, like Mr Decourrière, whom I congratulate, will realise this!	0.8023230165848707
- (FR) The INTERREG Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy.	0.6950024194149095
This apparently generous policy, officially intended to help problem regions, is a fool' s bargain for French taxpayers.	0.6026956171495497
France contributes 17% of the European budget yet will receive only 8% of the regional Structural Funds.	0.8856969819021668
Between 1994 and 1999, our regions annually received an average of FF 15.4 billion but will receive only FF 14.7 billion between 2000 and 2006.	0.5464281731925137
My region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be particularly affected with French Hainaut losing the aid paid to Objective 1 regions.	0.428599094996988
This loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free-trade Europe.	0.490095093771581
The European regional policy also reinforces the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds.	0.6813114665001617
This is a Europe of regions in which the regions, which are weaker than the nation states, will easily submit to Brussels.	1.0068705590037006
The INTERREG initiative, launched in 1990 to prepare the border regions for a Europe without borders and therefore without nations, sits comfortably within this philosophy.	0.6605872395547987
However, Mr Decourrière does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the Brussels technocrats.	0.6060492114953296
These failings will result in particular in the late implementation of INTERREG III and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid.	0.6854195959464785
We also agree with the rapporteur about asking for more attention to be paid to small and medium-sized undertakings and, of course, about refusing to use outside service providers.	0.7162989584222784
These are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous Commission.	0.7194549223838186
However, these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted, in no way remedy the Eurofederalist philosophy which characterises the Community initiatives, particularly INTERREG.	0.8506086045553797
This is why the National Front voted against the report.	0.903087047940577
The European Parliament has delivered an opinion on the Commission guidelines for the INTERREG Community Initiative concerning cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.	0.7721980164200116
I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative.	0.7773455563837173
This does not involve the concerns about the future of the Atlantic Arc but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand A on cross-border cooperation.	0.7454241395937583
In the Commission guidelines, few maritime areas are eligible for INTERREG IIIA. The amendments to the Decourrière report aim to make INTERREG more maritime-oriented.	0.7173977676086791
This is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the EU which is at stake.	1.2295465473489442
I am aware of the Commission' s reluctance on this subject as it announced during the symposium on the presentation of INTERREG III last November.	0.6784819226426925
However, I must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to denying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation.	0.8971524160034531
One example of this is the 'Celtic' area which encompasses the territories of Brittany in France, Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom and Cork and Waterford in Ireland. This is an area whose locally-based economy is characterised by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri-foodstuffs sector.	0.7529980196212693
It also has excellent cultural and relational links, through twinnings for example. INTERREG III, strand A, would allow the regions in this area to advance a number of structural projects needed to develop small and medium-sized undertakings and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer.	0.8106325972241671
The European Commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions.	0.7090419310357613
This policy would have important economic consequences for the fishing industry in Brittany in that catches could be unloaded at Irish advance bases in order to then be transported to the Breton agri-foodstuffs industry.	0.4803209005474161
The integration of the maritime border into strand A would finally allow the western periphery to be recognised as a unique and important economic area which is confronted by the 'continentalisation' of the European Union.	0.5746777540549224
This would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east.	0.5605675505761618
The maritime world has great potential.	0.25397932185157285
We therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be defined.	0.6797679931596109
. (DA) The European project began as a partnership between States.	0.8001879093869823
This partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of Europe for over 50 years.	0.6460030426687368
As a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world, of which the EU is just one proof, and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our Western values, competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades.	1.103973487470622
The EU should be prepared to meet that competition.	0.637297411635779
We can only do that by intensifying co-operation within the Community.	0.6686316401111123
It should not be about greater integration of the EU countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders.	0.8460270016028334
It is about co-operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides.	0.5245413363333997
A programme such as INTERREG is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders, projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale.	0.7144417578404412
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme.	0.7609864577656532
. (FR) Mr Decourrière' s report is not without merit: at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the INTERREG initiative and its role in opening up border regions, it comes out in favour of SMEs in paragraph 16.	0.9515058470772166
I and my colleague Dominique Souchet, who is well versed in this matter, have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of SMEs and craft trades within the framework of INTERREG, the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and I welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously.	0.8763892870194034
Nonetheless, the French delegation in our group was unable to accept the fact that the Commission and the federalist faction have diverted the INTERREG initiative from its original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nations.	0.8228873406644859
We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States, as suggested in recital of the report.	0.8436184780735495
We only ask one thing of the Commission: that it confine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not upset the balance of regional planning in our territories.	0.8090270794095644
The destructive effects of the CAP and EMU on the balance between regions, especially on the vitality of the more rural, the more remote and the least populated regions, is proof positive of the fact that such ambitions are not a sinecure, far from it.	0.8357289703981201
We are therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encouraging interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sidelining the Member States.	0.979130111855267
This infatuation with strand IIIC is all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledges in his explanatory statement that 'the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co-operation' (p.17) and that 'the responsibilities are diffuse and vague' (p.18).	0.7213311702850961
Calling under these circumstances, as he does in paragraph 20, for the budget for this strand to be increased is another example of the irresponsible and ideological outbidding tactics which are customary in this House.	0.8033422810711286
Lastly, there is the desire expressed both in the Commission document and Mr Decourrière' s report of using INTERREG for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans: I do not think that the Structural Funds should be used to repair the damage which the Americans inflicted on Serbia during bombardments which were as criminal as they were ineffectual.	0.8981826778497889
It is up to Washington, not us, to assume responsibility for a conflict which was triggered merely to serve its interests.	0.7823809636478635
The French delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the Decourrière report and will choose to abstain during the final vote.	0.684573321630476
Procacci report (A5-0025/2000)	0.22396615384924848
Mr President, I voted for the Procacci report on rural development, not only because I endorse the major policy lines of the LEADER programme, but also because it complements the URBAN programme, which I spoke about earlier.	1.0029701240782618
Just as elderly people in cities are very isolated, so the elderly are fast becoming the sole inhabitants of rural areas because young people are moving to the cities: they are drawn by the bright lights, and the pubs, and the countryside and rural areas are being emptied.	0.8234659608035287
I therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this European Union plan and for it to be further developed.	0.8340502374780149
- (PT) Although this Community initiative, LEADER +, follows on from previous initiatives, it has some unique features.	0.8031838640037209
One of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period.	0.6059088117093673
Nevertheless, new objectives have been included, specifically the financing of the Nature Network 2000, for which all rural regions will be eligible.	0.9810783082926302
In spite of the fact that this Community initiative is aimed at rural development, it does not address the issues of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way, and this is unacceptable.	0.9132043404316351
Without agriculture, the rural world will disappear.	0.6882305380903232
This means that any strategy for rural development must be based on agriculture' s internal potential while at the same time developing as many other activities as possible in order to prevent the desertification of the rural world.	0.7491224042716017
This is why we considered it essential to improve the report by means of our proposals deliberately to include agricultural activity and farmers in the strategy for rural development and to request more appropriations in order not to threaten the survival of the programme in those rural regions which were covered before. We also want to ensure that the new programme continues to prioritise the less-favoured regions.	0.8364442121077972
Our position on LEADER is a product of our more general assessment of the EU' s overall agricultural policy.	0.6715261352498467
Both LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, which were implemented in the 1990s, were ingredients of the new CAP that emerged after its review in 1992 and, along with other respective measures, they constituted the so-termed second pillar of the EU' s rural development policy.	0.831300572713122
Their real aim was to moderate and disguise the new CAP' s disastrous consequences and the disorientation of small and medium-scale farmers, and not to develop the rural areas or retain the agricultural population therein as was hypocritically declared in their objectives.	0.643165868257589
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented, farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly, which resulted in their depopulation.	0.7670898532943463
A characteristic example is Greece, which as an Objective 1 country was included as a whole in the LEADER Community initiatives, and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2.3%, while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decreased by 15.2%.	0.7813867912097134
We think LEADER + will be even more ineffectual than LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, for the following reasons.	0.6197633913293824
The real aims of LEADER + are the same as those of LEADERs 1 and 2, in other words to moderate and disguise the negative consequences of the CAP to be implemented in the context of Agenda 2000 and the WTO.	0.8901723986828909
The present CAP, however, is worse than its predecessor and it also starts from a worse basis, granted that the 1992 CAP review and the GATT agreement in 1995 have created serious problems and impasses for the agricultural economy.	0.6199036907778045
The selection criteria and the activities that are subsidised under LEADER do, in the best case, moderate some partial problems of the countryside, which are of secondary importance, but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and pandering to conscience.	0.8722331525370128
In no case, however, are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature.	0.751097773472671
The actual appropriations available for LEADER + compared with LEADER 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15% (from EUR 1 775 million for LEADER 2 to EUR 2 020 million for LEADER +).	0.542607192454838
This is because the 15% increase is nominal and not real, granted that average yearly inflation in the Community during those years was approximately 2%.	0.6028349632656357
