In the Commission, systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred.	0.5310206291991418
The treaties have been revised, new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission, and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union, in our continent and in the world.	1.0795705955170292
Those realities, together with the approach of further enlargements, all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission, so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development, of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness, maximum responsibility and maximum accountability.	0.7275034498155147
The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are, of course, basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised.	0.7186066118941603
Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too.	0.49598510631659565
The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind, and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere.	1.2470720113331424
But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance.	0.8776614164989739
That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide.	1.026557214653793
The House will be aware, of course, that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone.	0.9077512448715792
All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly.	0.7731979268730567
I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum.	0.9151217460989315
One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House.	0.9913156279853111
Last month, as Romano Prodi has just said, we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September.	0.8655839554424436
Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years.	0.6695701602722365
Inevitably, that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended.	0.8442078442478921
It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union.	0.6059492586684093
It means allocating staff to areas of high-policy importance within departments and across the Commission.	0.5059876989547665
And when that assessment is complete, we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us.	0.7542189213726229
If they are proven not to be, we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority.	1.006535844145426
If that does not meet with a positive response, the difficult issue of which of our lower-priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed, not just by the Commission, but by this Parliament and by the Council too.	0.9947461155969723
I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities.	0.6373478935540435
On the contrary, as many in this House understand, I am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability.	0.8702965315594057
That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both.	0.38329631813367526
In each of the three pillars of reform, the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital.	0.8982666998398202
The new activity-based management system, that the President just mentioned, will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time.	0.8984906268141967
The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will, therefore, be vital.	0.7619157358126305
Attempts to micro-manage the Commission' s operations are clearly in no one' s interest.	0.5204688291284792
A resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will, therefore, be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity-based management.	0.6206458305320907
In human resources policy, the involvement of Parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the Commission is accountable.	0.9119071096211642
Again, that will be a very demanding challenge.	1.1766463753212508
And finally, in the crucial area of financial management where the Court of Auditors, the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change, the support of this House in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance.	0.8546375368310263
In the limited time available for this statement, it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals.	0.7477822675659455
I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years, and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon.	1.0500526802723325
It is clear, of course, that in many ways the really hard work starts now, with the implementation of our proposals.	1.0378738238165004
I look forward to working with this Parliament, with the Council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the Union and for the advantage of all of its peoples.	1.1134057449148582
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	0.8339008111523093
We shall now move on to Question Time.	0.511456719161125
Madam President, the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials.	0.8415131091785412
Recently, the immunity of a former Commissioner was lifted and proceedings are currently pending before a judge in Brussels on the basis that Brussels is the seat of the Community institutions.	0.7159448210863913
Yet these institutions have other seats and, given that the Community' s actions affect the whole Community territory, there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials, Commissioners and so on.	0.8491148230573913
Is the Commission aware that, in order to lift immunity, it would be necessary to adopt a new legal instrument to regulate the procedure for holding Commission officials accountable, including former and current Commissioners?	0.90078933851704
There is effective legal precaution.	0.38997588095703134
In the particular case that the honourable Member has in mind, not only did the Commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former Commissioner, but the former Commissioner herself advised the Commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted.	0.7715764518040965
I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member, but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted, and every single one of those requests has been met, and met with alacrity.	0.8857558508681616
I think that the House can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded, but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every Member State in seeking to get information, or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the Commission.	0.8008510940885369
As the Parliament' s rapporteur on the staff elements of your report, Mr Kinnock, I very much welcome the fact that we are now starting the process, and if I may say to all colleagues here, we have a very important task to do, which will be absolutely central to the future of the Commission and its effectiveness.	1.1732748424018697
And I make the point, before I move to my questions, that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because, of course, the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions.	0.9230769609912161
That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process.	0.9813370777668231
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock, if I may.	0.748318915276762
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms.	0.43797148916309053
Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern.	0.9668916722686925
Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside.	0.7843905631138981
And if we are to move forward, I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side, early evidence of change of culture, empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later.	0.7688723817529565
And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations.	1.070293477082674
Indeed, it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced.	0.9767992717758699
I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that.	0.9120623507055596
The second point that I want to make concerns information technology.	0.7578137094686546
Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms.	0.7647327454595165
On the second part of Mr Harbour' s question, he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement.	0.8992782739470372
Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials, which is already very strong, will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training, the allocation of responsibility, the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing.	0.8689368884237918
Cultures are products of structures and systems, and the structures and systems have become old.	0.6962957103367902
By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before.	0.8909810878594869
I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour.	0.7408269668995013
I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices.	0.6111021487033618
I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002, but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect.	0.7627165773103338
I do not use those as an excuse.	0.6842231562313239
We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms, these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously.	0.7832575780842178
I would like everything to happen much more quickly.	0.7529680162036836
It is better to do it absolutely properly.	0.7129472614917999
Madam President, we admire Mr Kinnock' s vision and sense of realism. For he is holding up visions of a well-oiled and effective administration and is, at the same time, drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated.	0.649531838453083
Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities.	1.071192714600092
We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first.	0.7065749160721595
I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities, because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise.	0.8593451098037126
Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context.	1.025583252093402
I would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace, it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board.	0.853902187352876
We must resolutely switch from our present, rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace.	0.8553215464887547
Could Mr Kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the Council and Parliament to come up with for these priorities?	0.6390722574765305
I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House.	0.7145879856453414
Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out.	0.39644665871051293
We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities, not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have.	0.746380704801511
One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union.	0.9976927591051393
One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect.	0.7721403674106116
Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism.	0.5977710311529423
Since I was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised, I may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our mechanistic view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the Union and its enlargement.	0.9991424662269107
I hope that, in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament, not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way, but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union.	1.0354696797941207
I do believe that reform with all it implies, including the new mechanisms, will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind.	0.7301913246965864
I would like to take the opportunity firstly to congratulate the Commission on unanimously bringing forward this timely and substantial White Paper with the accompanying action plan and I think when the President of the Commission described his Vice-President as acting with intelligence, enthusiasm and energy that indeed that is a fair and valid description with regard to this procedure.	0.8220796159722247
Two questions if I may.	0.3862186467720137
We anticipate, if I understand correctly, a report in September on core activities.	0.9748574467418609
Will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the Parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the Commission anticipates such a procedure?	0.7834190688522482
Secondly, on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures, do I understand correctly - and I have not had the opportunity to wade into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the Commission is indeed to empower the Directorates-General to liberate them from the ex ante visae system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system?	0.8543396583050389
If that is the case I can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own Group, I believe that if we have demanded in this House as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the Commission, its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers.	1.0188669474156993
Let the managers manage.	0.1502140569347767
I want to thank Mr Cox and indeed his group for the way in which several Members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always, as he indicated, worthwhile.	0.7194244545011255
So far as the September communication is concerned, it is unprecedented.	0.7601056606084234
It will not be just one of the screenings that the Commission has periodically undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within Directorates-General and across the Commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands.	0.9468720172525182
It is conceivable therefore - I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision.	0.9290144012041399
That is a sensible forecast to make, it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain.	1.0601052374196036
Can I thank Mr Cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control.	0.8036624307870821
I would emphasise, too, that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to "responsibilise" - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means.	1.0755562926625215
In undertaking such a development in our organisation I am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations, both in the public sector and in the private sector, in the last decade or so.	0.801104385944663
I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks.	0.658700438100982
Financial control will be absolutely secured, both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes, and because we will introduce a completely professional, independent internal audit service.	1.0010297218025117
As I said earlier, our ambition is total security for money and value for money.	0.5996962976688881
We are also interested in value for the people who work for us.	0.8613487336728692
The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that.	0.5367059293674645
I am also grateful, at the risk of being repetitive, to Mrs Theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which, if she will allow me to say so, she played midwife to many of the changes which we are now contemplating.	0.9977738583439736
I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage.	0.6610225382171032
First of all, I am not sure if I got the interpretation properly, but I do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as Mrs Theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control.	0.9235255148384014
There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation.	0.8073976065794415
However, because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control, and audit under the present terms, it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role, no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it.	0.8409435115039202
So, the changes that we seek to make - as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way at all.	0.9843879941554448
Coherence, consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures.	0.5821189772820913
One is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system, another is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that those standards are set and supervised, and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service.	0.7543445016812921
	-0.0
I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very strong assurances.	0.854357552549106
There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General.	0.900167080254674
If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control, the ex ante system can be used.	0.7979623421739617
Naturally, there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage.	0.7679675810983215
Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system, it most certainly can be used.	0.8208934094882924
Lastly on transition, I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called "soft law" .	0.6117923069806713
We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call "hard law" .	0.6256530800426299
But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council.	0.9846780436559524
There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper.	0.5194328894679872
In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances.	1.0374415362001226
The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition.	0.829656865363147
Two other points I must make, because this is an essential question central to reform.	1.064385495432654
The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia.	0.9106260334584253
Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline.	0.6196400220812912
I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials, the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system.	0.7970390415237846
Inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring.	0.7007940269056304
Lastly, the system we currently have - as the Committee of Independent Experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable.	1.0498454322759119
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction.	0.5321250416491864
Change will have to come in any case, change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another.	0.6552937939287575
In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have, I am certain that we have installed, or that we will install on the basis of our proposals, a system that will provide the Union, its taxpayers and this House with complete security.	1.1398662797446408
Madam President, great importance has been attached to the reform process, which deserves to be acknowledged, although this may be somewhat premature.	0.9283709006889813
My question is this: there is a need for reform, due not least to the accession of new countries, and thus to the enlargement of the Union.	0.9446028841877059
How can we - the Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively, taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries?	0.9199979720813247
The delegations are actively engaged - as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic - but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another.	0.752983045471738
How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission, and the work they perform together, more effective?	1.2224815104385494
I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that, apart from its own inherent merits, reform will be made necessary by accession, the enlargements, and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in.	0.7240700206298765
It is essential that we have that reform, both for the sake of the current Union, and certainly to facilitate accessions.	1.127362504524521
In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started, together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously, of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States.	0.7696747181031665
We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering.	0.7576161124999187
I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities, the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market, it will be difficult to see the joins.	0.981361833042022
That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see.	0.7009500184380926
All I can do now is to promise to strive for it.	0.5912771311528485
Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David' s Day.	0.5238954892017931
Thank you for the presentation.	0.8236191088270436
It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public.	0.9198174529675683
That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time.	0.8106331057184962
It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome, but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork. Excessive paperwork.	0.8447161133767309
Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control?	0.4214542329608089
That is a clear complaint that we get.	0.9477771582128484
That needs to be addressed.	0.4337758246047192
The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee.	0.7508436041523187
This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure.	0.9481293339609648
Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee' s work?	0.54869842004465
Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words.	1.0369720773925142
The mission of reconnecting with the European public is critical as Mrs Morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words.	0.7770878322603539
I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words, but we will try to lead by example.	0.9227847155440996
As far as excessive paper is concerned, the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan.	0.6446812461334828
We detest the excess of paper, but given the requirements that we have to check and re-check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control, sometimes the requirements of administration, which some call bureaucracy, are unavoidable.	0.8508222818593499
In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too.	0.9232820678904702
We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent.	0.8654203486299819
One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform, the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe.	0.9149230604563343
I know I can rely on everyone here.	0.3419863248561916
That concludes Question Time.	0.08907304895423734
I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock.	0.804282546253548
Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy	0.36868200944558666
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy.	0.46667861190124427
Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay.	0.4385445948854909
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again, here in the European Parliament.	0.8153914533641948
Much has happened since the last time I was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent.	0.6787137908365088
Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened.	0.40595767390089305
This afternoon I should like to share with you some ideas, particularly on the Common Foreign and Security Policy.	0.6654245462398993
The world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred. However, I will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me.	0.7018834296225729
In recent months, since the last time I appeared before you, important events have occurred in this House and also in the European Union. I would remind you of two of these events, one of which is very dear to you all as members of this Parliament, and particularly to the President.	1.172553352829672
These are the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the European Union.	0.6930843909776747
The events in Kosovo and the Balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds. There are also important issues at stake in the Middle East in which the President of this House played a major role on her recent trip.	0.903214386485229
Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America.	0.8669239805982838
Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region.	1.0556279156869117
However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki.	0.7460850366424988
I will speak of this briefly. If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them.	0.9911422838205618
The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago.	0.5878436535912943
Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent.	0.579194764490513
These were essentially of three types which I will describe.	0.5669055449679667
The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management.	0.6398384543734251
The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union' s relations with third countries and other organisations.	0.9892076452744646
This basically involves relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and relations between the European Union and those countries which, although geographically in Europe, are not part of the European Union, or at least not at the moment.	0.966132640566453
I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events.	0.6066882503365127
Firstly, with regard to the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning, 1 March 2000. This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council.	0.9155629995633516
Therefore, two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision, a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union.	0.9351149833573804
I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch.	0.6046051361618953
You can be satisfied with the progress made.	0.6770375529727948
The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months.	0.8122293604691917
Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration.	0.8998544089071601
This Military Committee, as you can imagine, will have various duties.	1.0498441985871183
In the interim stage, its basic duty will be to advise the Council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will, of course, try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next.	0.8910672124860769
Thirdly, the Military Staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries. Together with myself, this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare, with the assistance of the Military Committee, any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the European Union.	0.8071137476315541
This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces.	0.6168285020345009
Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics, not for military purposes, but with strictly humanitarian ends.	0.7896531331374349
We are therefore working diligently in this respect. Madam President, if, a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time, I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today, that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use, many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad.	1.0308691763735158
We are not mad. What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent.	1.047191754044316
Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination, drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki.	0.6903414001288474
In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission.	0.6874585657161197
I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time.	0.777395366075108
I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you. We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility.	1.096559748643154
Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace.	1.0689664154299856
It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict, to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them. As you may recall, it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States.	0.9573130856167741
It will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days, or two months, to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year. This is a major operation and an important objective but I can say that we are in a position to meet this challenge which the Heads of State and Government posed in Helsinki.	0.9477181681275502
On Monday, just two days ago, in Sintra, a beautiful city very close to Lisbon, the Defence Ministers of the fifteen Member States met and took some important decisions towards implementing this Headline Goal defined in Helsinki.	0.7235110127093936
The proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us, including this House.	0.6400310355931018
I will set this out in five points.	0.41049113273211657
Firstly, before the next General Affairs Council which will take place this month, we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the Headline Goal, bearing in mind the views that the military planners may consider appropriate.	0.8514120328193217
To say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace.	0.9044161671021631
We must therefore have considered all possible scenarios so that we can do this job and do it well.	0.7692233576841281
Before 24 March we will therefore have established this timetable so that the General Affairs Council can, on this date, do its job and do it well.	0.8187396669865691
Secondly, we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries.	0.8066258075441616
Thirdly, we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide.	0.8499194081478485
We may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs.	0.9392166117471735
How can we do this?	0.6764591220817741
This should be decided by a Conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen Member States.	0.9522055510157588
Madam President, the timetable must ensure that, by December of this year during the French presidency, the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match. We will then be able to say truthfully that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available.	1.0473169982632027
This is what we are doing and we are committed to this.	1.0442309945954422
We have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the Portuguese presidency, which is clearly carrying out excellent work, and during the French presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions.	0.8715081695554648
I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils, those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency.	0.9260875649575574
On these four occasions, the Heads of Government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that, by the year 2003, we are able to deploy what we have agreed, if necessary.	1.0475351869992802
Madam President, we are therefore working on this issue with determination, energy and the full support of all the governments and all the Heads of Government.	1.1092842823537394
I have two further points to make on this process.	0.6713621507638797
The European Union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which I have referred which, although geographically in Europe, are not members of the European Union.	1.0167137755781575
We have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises, which I hope will not be the case, all forces and all countries will be more than welcome.	1.0968214147492872
Secondly, we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with NATO. The operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types.	1.089858340690167
The first type will be operations in which European forces are involved within the framework of NATO. The second will be operations involving European forces and directed by them, but using the means and infrastructure of NATO.	0.7689840884164812
The third will be operations in which the European forces act alone. In the first and second types we will need to cooperate with NATO and must therefore establish a transparent, positive and confident relationship between ourselves and NATO, as appropriate, which will be good for both the Alliance and ourselves.	0.9659412740077683
Madam President, I have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide, the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months.	1.0963949271884352
However, we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well.	0.764272779418491
As far as possible, we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans.	0.8313033896533941
We are working in this direction with the Commission and Commissioner Patten.	1.1832214544505248
On Saturday morning I will meet with all the Ministers for Home Affairs of the fifteen Member States to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well.	0.69121310189724
There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that, after a few months, a police force is needed rather than a military force. Then, in the final moments of the crisis, it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police.	0.8066291908958044
In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission.	0.915387086733342
I am not going to say much more on these issues.	0.7106734192280086
Many other events have taken place in recent weeks which I should like to mention, such as in Kosovo, the Middle East and Chechnya. There are also many other issues which I should like to discuss with you.	0.8495569977930507
However, I would prefer, Madam President, to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that I have time to answer them.	1.0604370969348962
However, before this happens, I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya.	1.0284476314386504
Mr Gil-Robles returned this morning from Chechnya where he visited Grozny. When we spoke he gave me his initial impressions which are not good, as you can imagine.	0.7762170711575429
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating.	0.5044375913426422
In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations.	0.6757978870234401
In Grozny, there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat.	0.6856545103735251
Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you.	0.7646706878484939
Mr Gil-Robles told me that, when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night, the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities. The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well, if feasible.	0.8581999025779163
These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment.	0.840933810220515
I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities.	0.9307683370869532
Madam President, this brings me to the end of my speech.	0.9207230817958431
I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning.	0.7236554680033034
I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission. This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations.	1.0536023032687774
Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world.	0.8010881876957034
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana. I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.	0.8778398174524855
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	0.7362885929296353
Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes.	0.9811247617010125
Commissioner, would you like to speak now or a little later?	0.8173652072820087
(The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later) Very well, thank you.	0.5134279063314797
Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Javier Solana, usted no es una persona loca, todo lo contrario (you are not mad, quite the opposite).	0.6957314936097199
We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit.	0.8149414188364729
We know that you have an important role in this.	1.1140512521007244
I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today, and in this context, and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question.	1.1389435910984393
We cannot, of course, talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya.	0.5154306689170434
My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group.	0.5819609850555071
I want to concentrate on Kosovo.	0.5191603090867811
It is now quite clear that the situation in Kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means.	0.8365220908645502
The KFOR forces have made, and are making, an invaluable contribution, but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term.	0.7615588120877755
It has now reached the point where the Pentagon has prohibited American forces from returning to northern Mitrovica.	0.4756234673162422
They have now been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish and Swedish troops.	0.44945208011788723
It is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred, but it is important for the sake of Kosovo, the Balkans and Europe that we do not fail.	0.8901340388277595
Through the Stability Pact, we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation.	0.7807966773158677
This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union' s common foreign and security policy.	0.673807807575547
At the moment, there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in Kosovo.	0.6480633166941109
Last autumn, we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force.	0.7518641217246211
I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing.	0.8709758620109802
I hope that this discussion will, in the first place, concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied.	0.8325375280009127
When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament' s and, as I understand it, also the Commission' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo.	1.0631897652092737
The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management, an idea which has already been translated into practical action.	0.9711031608313936
Another, at least as important, lesson of our experience, however, is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently.	0.9728794702056766
Therefore, the EU must also have an independent, credible conflict-prevention capacity.	0.874647472269441
On behalf of the Commission, Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction.	0.8613006751617199
I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations, together with a Commission Crisis Centre.	0.8386172220310408
My last question to Mr Solana is this: what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind?	0.8587014720903016
How have these been organised by Mr Solana' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission?	0.6119749230896437
Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders.	0.8242556592339451
I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian, peace-keeping and peace-making tasks.	0.7244287739258005
But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe.	0.8766301543726
Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights.	0.3395033133098901
I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament.	0.6894934610212132
You must lay these concerns to rest for, as you yourself have said, when we are able to present a united transatlantic front, we are in a position to do something.	1.0748109808708466
When we are divided, we are weakened, and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged.	0.8959722547940835
So, maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway, Turkey and Canada, either.	0.7027713447353325
You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers.	0.6012154833242999
As George Robertson has said so often, we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo.	0.6049585878875271
It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war.	0.607874592992844
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats.	0.5158276510835232
Everything else is wishful thinking.	0.14239033863627837
That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment. We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra.	0.7771844446304524
The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny.	0.6448868879617092
This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States.	0.5711541046100511
No soldier can, of course, be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament.	0.7012026033203721
It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army.	0.874378821927187
It will be a force comprised of various national units.	0.7050887894766972
What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment.	0.6693602229904748
However, there is, of course, also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament.	0.8089820470246623
As someone who both speaks and listens, we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.	0.6269962351247378
Finally, I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion.	0.6221319265686015
Yesterday, a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister.	0.8563730048247093
He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much.	0.6504881080603371
Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table.	0.6973475178332718
We share your delight, as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired.	0.6095455409809201
There is one thing I shall again finally emphasise: that the purpose of all this is, of course, that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all.	0.7867490974015637
That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries.	0.8730645938367635
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are all behaving like children.	0.9793947074977972
You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers.	0.6008984536618261
It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004, 2005, 2006.	0.3859233375942179
But what about Kosovo in the year 2000?	0.578072503435232
You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles. I have received an e-mail from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pristina at the moment.	0.8502750006409358
He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina.	0.4483029921263682
He treated Roma, Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo.	0.6283610539034541
A man with three children and he was murdered.	0.3193787355274679
We need policemen in Kosovo right now!	0.27331627491375554
We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice.	0.6361516516440805
I am not a warmonger, but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in Kosovo, then what is the point in having soldiers at all?	0.9976037758824101
People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo, but that is the price of freedom at the moment.	0.9602587006595473
If we allow what is happening today in Kosovo to continue - border provocation, Serbian provocation, Albanian provocation, etc. we are heading for war.	0.7817151538712805
Tell me, what civilian forces are being mobilised, Mr Patten?	0.8481110885100186
We need a civilian task force in Kosovo now to monitor what is happening, and to tell the military and the police what they must do, otherwise everything we did in Bosnia and everything we did in Kosovo will be negated by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence.	0.8236265075746183
(Interruption from the extreme right by Mr Martinez) We have a major problem, because we are providing travel warrants for the people, but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis, as in Chechnya.	1.1207107395816858
Mr Poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so.	0.8770588057814042
He is not always right, but in this case he is.	1.2478753512112377
I am in favour of a hardline policy against Austria, but we shall then have a responsibility towards Russia.	0.8991770038748957
I do not like foreign ministers who say nothing - whether they are German and from my party, whether they are French from the broad left or whether they are Italians from any party!	0.684857064529041
In the current situation, we should say to the Russians "If you want money, if you want us to reduce your debts, you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into Russia" .	0.9959008773581822
If not, we are not prepared to pay for their war, since, by reducing the debt, by giving them money, we are paying their soldiers to carry out the massacres.	1.023586654172977
We are accomplices in the massacres in Chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers.	0.5651961036845162
It is not enough just to say, "You, the murderers, please stop the slaughter!"	0.8849368633834339
They know full well that they should not commit these acts.	0.602886121191814
Do you think that Mr Putin does not know that what he is doing in Chechnya is not good?	0.823629889049643
But that is his strategy, he instigated this war.	0.6934540481155107
From the beginning, he wanted this war in order to become president.	0.7548926937756154
So that is the world as it is today.	1.0041857165534662
For that reason I say to you: my Group is not entirely in agreement, but I am in favour of European defence.	0.9940779648774075
I believe that European defence should be scrutinised by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments.	0.9644134012833376
First of all, the European Parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers.	0.8504637137804666
If a civilian task force can, at the same time, intervene before and during a conflict and if we fail to take that step, we are behaving like children who like to play at sending in soldiers, but who are incapable of sending in civilians.	0.6614537497826865
As long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements, we shall not be credible.	1.0435291732373388
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are very uneasy about replying to you because, in our view, you are responsible for an area that does not really exist.	0.9991315513233953
We believe that poor old Europe can only speak with one voice to say nothing or, and this is possibly more serious, that it can only resolve its diplomatic contradictions by simply tagging along with American politics.	0.7677523940461939
In the lyrical mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of, at Sintra, the Fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is 'pretentiously' called autonomous.	0.6486740195085633
Now, the Union can certainly call the body an 'action force' even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the mustering - on paper - of men, weapons and logistics.	0.9216231993703153
But to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether.	0.5748115598294714
What interests will this so-called force defend, in view of the fact that the countries of Europe do not have the same interests?	0.9259140796725195
Let us just consider for a moment.	0.3060217533806256
What is the basis of armed action?	0.7094781700506483
It is the defence of a territory, the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital?	0.9393736864501329
Just what is an army in the absence of a home country, in the absence of territory - because Europe is incapable of clearly defining its borders - and in the absence of clearly identified vital interests, which the Fifteen have, for good reason, never dared to discuss.	0.8715052199715371
In short, what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy?	0.6787117972065791
We fall back on a kind of ersatz army based on humanitarian rights, a kind of army in the service of vague ideas, of an ideal, the dangers of which have many times been shown in history.	0.7668450007852812
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one' s own interests.	0.520295953484917
But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system.	0.5386870956918466
Who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the twosome formed by London and Berlin, escorted by their respective henchmen, and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of Washington, seeing themselves at best as bit-part players.	0.6721748890956384
Mr Solana, you yourself are a perfect illustration of this, as it were, structural complicity, passing smoothly from NATO to the CFSP as if they were one and the same. Of course, in reality, they are the same thing.	0.8413980129917612
It is still the old imperial service.	0.7411748472290546
It is not without some amusement that we have seen you, in your pathetic rivalry with Mr Patten, present this delightful and most charming argument: one day you told a German newspaper, "I am the one that the Americans phone up" .	0.8535475556929036
You might have added, Mr Solana, 'to give me their instructions' , because that is what we see, in fact.	0.9401544142272358
In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it.	0.7871085013350706
Yes, Jean-Claude Martinez was indeed right to interrupt you, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. In every case, it is follow-my-leader syndrome.	0.5827175627708906
Do you think I am going over the top?	0.7936872065894995
Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience.	0.35187933726998516
Echelon is one of many examples of this, giving an image of Europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here.	0.867175315527344
The experts speak of a cultural problem, I think they might be right!	0.9362860407321537
On behalf of the combined European right, I must say to you, Mr Solana, as High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, we do not have confidence in you.	0.9588806002280308
You say that you are against war, but as Secretary-General of NATO you started a war.	0.8191969742561821
A war of aggression, slavishly carrying out American military policy, in a sphere that was not that of the North Atlantic Treaty, against a state that had never been a member, that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non-interference as well as those governing the declaration of war.	0.8083831582533277
Today, even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for.	0.8633831088040295
We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern, that is the least one can say.	0.9256874336768699
First of all, in your view, does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world?	0.9881039582657017
Secondly, if you do recognise this right, then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on?	0.8450510580709824
I can already hear your reply: humanitarian standards.	0.35904838650905985
In Kosovo, it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia.	0.666565705028297
When the US killed 2 000 people in Panama, it was not to impose their politics, it was to combat drug trafficking.	1.0005058676975276
When they landed in Somalia, before having to withdraw in disarray, it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route, it was to restore hope.	0.9166379546992224
'Restore hope' , do you remember?	0.5544931334440566
In a nutshell, can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons.	0.6260695138055068
Finally, you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management.	0.7724160771982953
Not to make war, of course, but to protect peace.	0.9556576285280599
But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions.	0.5049773503626591
Can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any State you care to mention, particularly those which, in their elections, do not ratify the policy adopted by the other Member States of the Union?	0.922890211349264
Mr Solana, these questions convey our concern.	0.5685679977921583
You say that you are against war, but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that.	1.027214570702437
May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward.	0.647894281836057
Mr President, it goes without saying that the development of a European security and defence identity will have a huge impact on the three countries which joined NATO last year: Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.	0.8437369215412603
As candidate countries of the European Union, they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning, that is to say as of now.	0.8597780198072261
This request, however, was not honoured by the Council at its Helsinki Summit at the end of last year. In the Finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation.	0.8142926610675509
This is why I would like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, to what extent Prague, Warsaw and Budapest are, or will be, involved in European military crisis management plans.	0.8510446358283723
Given Poland' s rather critical stance, this question is all the more pressing.	0.7273563565483668
Its reservation is captured in the following, rather blunt wording: avoid American isolationism and European separatism.	0.4566720657766947
As one might expect, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Bronislaw Geremek, has expressed this concern in more diplomatic terms: "The development of a European defence identity should not be at the expense of NATO' s unity.	0.9040782585830035
If anything, the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO" .	0.8306413757657091
We all very much share this opinion.	0.42598378674499066
Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today.	0.5749344121537038
The Czech Defence Minister, for example, shares this opinion. In the autumn of last year, the latter stated: "Security within Europe is not divisible.	0.8343530225155793
It cannot be restricted to a small number of countries, with others only being allowed to observe or execute decisions" .	0.6620178226543205
These opinions add substance to my question addressed to Mr Solana.	0.5433171751134459
Poles only need five words for this: nothing about us without us!	0.3546575854906355
What do the current EU Member States intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries?	0.574333187468416
Mr President, I too welcome the presence of the High Representative and his availability to answer Members' questions this time round. On his first appearance in November this was not possible, although this was not Mr Solana' s fault.	0.9127270585745045
It should be acknowledged, however, that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members.	0.7287313266455192
We should also acknowledge the efforts which Mr Solana is making towards achieving a more effective, visible and coherent Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union.	0.7587472285593422
In this respect, I agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian, diplomatic, humanitarian and police elements, to which Mr Solana referred.	0.8687745657139435
The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies.	0.5948145050336874
In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy.	0.4174002897505362
One of these milestones was the meeting in Sintra which I would like to ask Mr Solana about.	0.8754476840613057
This meeting was based on two documents, one being a British document on the Headline Goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union.	0.6987108519341025
Mr Solana, would you be prepared, at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit? I should like to ask Mr Patten and, through you, the President-in-Office to also attend and answer the same question.	0.844125611824207
Secondly, to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7% of GDP to defence expenditure?	0.7628378680098524
I would like to hear your opinion. Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect?	0.8836714130923988
Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the 'Crisex 2000' exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation?	0.8250581383999693
Fourthly and finally, if the Member States asked for this, would you be prepared to chair the Political and Security Committee? In this way you could contribute all your experience as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary-General of the Western European Union and a former Secretary-General of NATO.	0.8169636716774571
Mr Solana, as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall limit my speech to those subjects.	0.8084854787338205
You have, Mr Solana, heard the force of the criticisms made by the Members of Parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in Kosovo, Chechnya and elsewhere.	0.782344896482962
For my part, I do not wish to give up hope.	0.8057370551470882
And today, as far as you are concerned, I acknowledge your efforts to build a European security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed.	0.8928579566318925
Indeed, we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective, in any case, the objective that I wish to achieve.	1.0289984399203636
But I do give you credit for your intense work, the number of meetings held, your efforts to create a rapid intervention force, your specific efforts to prevent crises, to manage them or stop them through civilian means and, if necessary, by military means.	0.8187732658828727
I should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the "what is to be done" variety.	0.8465793373456453
The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December, without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon.	0.5774770510675511
What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings?	0.7045386697610909
And finally, what do you most need at these next summits?	0.6929493575008158
My second question is different, although it is not unconnected with the previous one.	0.9028317071162391
It concerns the next IGC.	0.6175920970989776
Do you not think that the agenda of the IGC should include the question of European security and defence policy in order to supplement the treaties, if it appeared that, as the texts of the treaties stand at the moment, they do not allow for a real defence policy to be established?	1.0220549826341345
I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February.	0.8632932262456042
Can you tell us your position on this subject?	0.7833135816560153
Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe.	0.47163160390059217
At long last, the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative.	0.7949962723526727
The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent.	0.7033118358810576
However, if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times, the Treaty must include a flexibility clause.	0.9342136638576504
Mr Solana can play an important role in this.	0.6400774350433579
He is not stupid. Certainly not!	0.5482257887222464
He is a driven man, a competent man.	0.6882937410297847
But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence.	0.5608537479135524
In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit.	0.8790662532255848
One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep, Mr President.	0.6047651385426788
From a democratic point of view, I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable. This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is, of course, not a democratically elected politician, but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament.	0.9234036221146413
His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten, as has been illustrated again today, in fact.	0.8374404222344911
It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold.	0.972688658690685
This too is unacceptable in my view.	0.6487869582345074
Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power.	0.8706355675703263
Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself.	0.2449486121408566
Mr President, peace is the European Union' s very raison d' être. I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly.	0.8295201123481738
We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance.	0.7889391992684062
But look at us now! We are observing the misery in Chechnya in a position of powerlessness, and regard the wars in Africa with indifference, despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries, given that they are ex-colonies.	0.8354431884550413
Some of them are our ACP partners.	0.7034745187754122
The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment.	0.5591770243535978
In Kosovo, we stepped in with military means, having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia.	0.862657442508543
We are now unable to guide the peace.	0.5971564093659829
This is why Europe is not credible as a Union.	0.8193465656945281
I do not believe, Mr Solana, that we can restore this credibility by military means.	0.989229653149349
As representatives from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries, but we always needed to fight those who came to oppress us.	0.6678644714180131
We are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term. This is not because we are against European defence, but European defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound, democratically-based decision process in respect of foreign affairs.	0.8148837530484287
At the moment, Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of.	0.8366195811651044
I can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level.	0.769773478662225
In my opinion, it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment, which are such nice toys, after all.	0.7904686971614759
I am very sceptical about the fact that Commissioner Patten cannot inform us in an equally credible way that he has drafted a prevention plan to stave off further degeneration, underdevelopment and conflicts in Europe and outside.	0.6698255078909764
Because our borders do not stop at the Mediterranean Sea.	0.40922686138693437
Mr President, allow me to start with the conquest of Kosovo.	0.6143920069144889
It is obvious since the NATO bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing, not to promote peace and order but to drive a wedge even further into Yugoslavia, to change the borders and to promote the New Order.	0.7894176985775344
Today, we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities.	0.6336570981092418
All the signs point towards a second round of attacks on Yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the KLA attacks on Serbs in Mitrovica, the attempt to annex three towns in southern Serbia to Kosovo, the promotion of the independence of Kosovo, the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into Kosovo via Greece, despite the objections of the Greek people and, at the same time, intense efforts by NATO and the European Union to overturn the legitimate government of Yugoslavia.	0.7019103849953973
On the other hand, despite his declarations on humanity and peace, it is clear from what Mr Solana has told us that, according to the Helsinki resolutions, we intend to set up a terrorist army, starting with 60 000 men, in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the parapet.	0.7862587832745599
Mr Solana has confirmed our view that, in a militarised European Union, NATO will have the upper hand.	0.9010465845293448
That is why this job went to Mr Solana, the Secretary-General of NATO, who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia; the right man for the right job, against whom charges have been filed, calling for him to be tried as a war criminal.	0.8033229867554598
Commissioner, Mr Solana, there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas.	0.9314277890065961
I wonder, and here I do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow Members, about the direction in which we are going.	0.9742707105296309
I think that contrary to the great process of Economic and Monetary Union, which was an integrated process within the Community structures, today, unfortunately, the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure.	0.9336715871510042
My first question, Mr Solana and Commissioner, is to establish whether, together, you have framed strategies that will, at least gradually, lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the Community process.	1.0480564598785107
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union.	0.6583422142998515
We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear.	0.9836359725850943
I also believe that we should not underestimate, and this is a question that I put to you, the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries.	0.9987303692172234
We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community.	0.6533609939371556
Today, they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy, and I believe that they are working with that in mind.	0.9326295634777743
Finally, with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo.	0.9067720218921694
Without this status, there will only be instability, murders, provocation by Belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the European Union should come to a decision on this matter.	0.9446439420383278
Finally, I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives, as we say in common parlance, are getting a bit much.	1.03027808851088
I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice, for example.	0.7432340879738027
Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates, we have still not had a trial, and we still do not know what is happening.	0.8722562872352101
As far as tourism is concerned, there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium, for example.	0.7148348664087739
So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him, which is what I hope will happen.	0.8260659383267707
Mr President, first of all, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Solana on this first day of March, for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on European security and defence policy.	0.7572091244944016
But I do wonder what his own view is on this.	0.7599142415084827
According to the documents, cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful.	0.864332805878219
You said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch. You have to admit, it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks.	0.9390412050011969
But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light?	0.6641408369526121
I - and I believe many with me in Parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent.	0.8642422643266336
Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO.	0.8790647366400088
One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course.	0.6341097337930707
The Treaties also point in that direction, although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar.	0.7647090525406889
We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar.	0.5100377614386027
Actually, I hear less and less about this.	0.7670906191440832
I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment.	0.8592082855806624
It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation, which would work very well.	0.8461310885231053
But is there not more to it than that?	0.43433039303604365
I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence.	0.5984150877022285
The European pillar does not really function any more as such. Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks.	0.6429218510253473
Is this actually how we want things done?	0.3191274224662298
Moreover, whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union, there is no longer any mention of Article V, which is, of course, of direct concern to us. Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg.	0.8966469878622907
Will it be omitted?	0.4956556741360762
At the same time, an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets.	0.7530225530025246
I think that this is to be welcomed, but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider, collective defence tasks.	0.9098177914666937
I wonder how this will develop.	0.32016780798465566
I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future.	0.6035290061734626
Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling?	0.5818490793278566
I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy.	0.7058811394049685
I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy?	0.8068069609363308
The fabric of Turkey' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities.	0.484718741111909
That would seem odd to me.	0.24553968344575247
Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door.	0.6515600958370098
Will they also take part in our defence policy?	0.4770852707159798
It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least.	1.3008342396933712
High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force.	0.8245569574541189
However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further.	0.6834503388121422
I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.9310061094164858
A word of warning to the latter: this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation.	0.6583066737870391
We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management.	0.876658122691812
At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing.	0.9122223743176607
Do you think that any of these issues could be included, at least in the agenda of the current Conference?	1.022729070874588
Mr Solana, I am sitting quite close to you, close enough to see your face.	0.7069349434225973
I think that you have aged, your face is quite lined.	0.8324654803622321
It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers, as Mrs Maes just put it, and what you do not say.	0.8734987068420311
You bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another bout of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and yet you have stood up here, while blood is being spilled in Kosovo, and you have not said a word about it.	0.745521906455424
You are Spanish; you are from a large country, Mr Solana.	0.8032541020134065
Spain and Franco were not one and the same.	0.4760927502742162
Spain maintained its unity, it kept the Basque country and Andalucia and Catalonia and it did well to do so, because no one identified Spain with Franco and no one played around with Spain' s unity in the name of a Fascist dictator.	0.6452515479367124
Today, you are identifying Yugoslavia with Milosevic and you are playing with Voivodina, with Montenegro and with southern Serbia. It is you who has created this mess.	0.7040502363693835
Which is why, unless they are accompanied by clear political solutions which respect borders and autonomy and all the democratic guarantees, all these plans on paper will lead to new blood-letting in the Balkans.	0.6771983843941661
Mr Solana, the war in Kosovo and the continuing crisis, have served to reveal a European public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the European Union, throughout the world, should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America and that the time has come to share the burden, which our American friends have constantly been demanding since Europe became a world economic power.	0.8519859602963085
Over the last year, the Member States of the Union have, naturally, decided to implement specific measures designed to strengthen the operational capability of their armed forces and the informal summit in Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main trends.	0.7718921602009764
I have two questions on this subject to which your knowledge of the subjects concerned and the parties involved should make it possible to provide enlightening replies for our further debates and our work.	0.7046699670270692
The first question concerns the training of this rapid intervention force of 60 000 men, which, as you have said, is likely to be deployed to perform peace-keeping and peace-building missions and be capable of maintaining them on a long-term basis, if necessary.	0.8181799486820319
For the information of our colleagues, I must say here that the corresponding contingents should be divided into three parts: one third to prepare the mission, one third to carry it out and one third for rehabilitation, following often difficult ordeals for personnel and equipment.	0.7410395965196217
This explains why the initial figures given in the press, setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men, is close to reality, which has certainly surprised the uninitiated.	0.7271758146057303
My first question, Mr Solana, will be simple and more direct, perhaps, than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me.	0.7977320035105137
You know the French proverb, 'Nothing for nothing' .	0.5733278186453872
Do you really think that the governments of the Union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them, apparently at least, have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends.	0.8238745001189101
My second question is of a more technical nature, but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible.	1.0343265438577807
You have told us, in this regard, that three committees are being set up, a political committee and a security committee, which started up today, and a military committee.	1.0632846926706463
You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union.	0.8277900899982275
In the operation of the temporary institutions, whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr Solana, what status you intend to confer on the members of the Alliance and on the associate States of the WEU which, I repeat, are not yet members of the European Union?	0.969068946064418
Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, in the different political and security committees or in the military committee?	1.0368152022028467
You know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and I should like to say that I understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion.	0.9009920090301295
Mr President, Secretary-General, as you can tell, the Members of this House have listened with great interest to your information on the result of the Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers in Sintra and its significance in the European integration process in terms of security and defence.	0.9989399568885323
Thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with Mr Gil-Robles.	0.3370198236415174
However, in terms of foreign policy, I am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements, as some Members have said this afternoon, without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against.	0.991138014192908
I will give you an example.	0.602828528141299
During the recent trip by the President of the European Parliament to the Middle East, which you mentioned, the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the European Union in the on-going peace process in the region.	0.9921465381703239
Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties?	0.6446963502952394
This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt.	0.9241817436801454
In this respect, as you will know, the European Parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the Community. This is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination.	0.9505725893977355
Could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative, without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee?	0.7464830314199423
Mr Solana, it has been said many times in this House that prevention is better than cure.	1.077677022844751
Of course it is, but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful.	0.7863286677027977
In any case, it is prevention that I would like to discuss today.	0.6661802259259109
War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf.	0.5157524157970395
As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.	0.803640320004926
If this happens, the United States' Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention.	0.9499343613294842
A visit to Iraq and meetings with the Iraqi leaders and leading figures, particularly Mr Tarek Aziz, convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the Iraqi Government to cooperate in enforcing Resolution 1284.	0.6579278241490121
However, the responsible authorities of the Western countries need to make it clear that, once the mission of the United Nations committee has been successfully completed, the embargo will be lifted and normal trade relations will be able to be resumed.	0.8737573813842275
I would like to know what you and Europe are doing, Mr Solana, or what you intend to do in the near future, to stave off this threat of war.	0.919445313396926
Today, we have the chance to prevent it; tomorrow it may be too late.	0.8901708771709844
I would also like to know whether, in this context, it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis, or to set them free if this is within their power.	0.9360571649346383
As we sit here, hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in Mozambique.	0.48976541990728056
This has not just happened.	0.44858298134847213
The flooding has been going for weeks, and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need.	0.8087873642076314
The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic.	0.7848046773994551
For a long time, many of us have sounded a warning that the European Union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision-making structures, when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments, particularly for humanitarian intervention.	0.844285472891737
I acknowledge Mr Patten' s efforts in this direction, but what a pity that the governments of the Member States had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of NATO.	0.6691967381777749
Of course, there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries.	0.793105086510698
These are of long standing, but are being addressed already within NATO.	0.8376749331514479
I have not yet heard a convincing security-policy explanation of why the European Union needs to establish autonomous, decision-making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the NATO structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival NATO.	0.7941395189531971
After all, the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table.	0.6964711010367463
NATO is largely European.	0.2174719184370968
Finally, Mr Solana, I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe.	0.7611252153384374
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, with regard to the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the European Union in particular.	0.9860448816994657
Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide.	0.8926419308831623
How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters?	0.6558469532132131
How should we describe the sinister filtration camps, which are comparable to concentration camps, in which the population is suffering the most dreadful humiliation and from which able-bodied men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive?	0.6590439450353429
How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called "cleansing" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe?	0.8587276008477219
And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres?	0.529547467334464
If that is realpolitik, if we really do not have any means, Mr Solana, as High Representative of the CFSP, and Commissioner, I put this question to you both, let us at least use the means that we do have, namely, the aid programmes to Russia.	1.068865657257077
The war in Chechnya proves, if proof were necessary, that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers.	0.8951246161057829
Let us therefore ensure that in future any euro spent in the Russian Federation is spent to alleviate the suffering of the people who are the victims of war, to the exclusion of any other objective.	0.7708359055622744
Mr High Representative, you have spoken to us of the progress made to date in relation to the decisions taken at Helsinki.	0.8448720514965937
Some of us here are passionately in favour of creating a distinctly European security organisation to defend peace in the world.	0.6646267932775625
Of course we recognise the role of the Security Council, as the Helsinki resolutions clearly state, in maintaining international peace and security.	0.9966624448900034
However, we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the Security Council, as referred to at Helsinki, was contested recently.	0.9848328234212316
The point is: does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism, which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg decisions?	0.7829986036994057
What about the infrastructures?	0.3483203504193518
Is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy?	0.7651625725169804
Secondly, what will happen to the European defence industry which, after all, comes under the more general activities relating to this system?	0.9361286558901927
Will current programmes continue to be implemented?	0.7083798417209592
Finally, if the Treaty needs to be amended, how do you think this amendment will be implemented, following the report to be submitted in Feira? How will it be incorporated into the more general procedure for amending the institutional framework of the Treaty and how do you think this will fit in with the possibility of a system of qualified majority voting?	0.9541526451223976
Has any thought been given to the matter?	0.6669915218511362
Has it been discussed?	0.16511969158500073
And to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient?	0.6868669286703234
Mr President, I seem to recall from my study of European history, that the 1809 Convention of Sintra was a controversial peace agreement which probably lengthened rather than shortened the Napoleonic wars and nearly cost the Duke of Wellington his job.	0.5662508135818017
I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement.	0.8784744929197524
That said, I would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far.	0.9199714661714573
But it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters, and the real test of the European defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity, rather than nicely formulated institutions.	0.8907000068193189
And, to that end, I am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation, or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity, particularly given the American statements that they are not giving intelligence to Europeans until they can deal with security.	0.8976929561325363
We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels.	0.6937471292791071
To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure, because some Member States spend considerably more than others.	0.6972468572844968
And indeed, some Member States are not geared for mobility.	0.8867007671309278
They are very static in their military forces, and unsuitable for this sort of warfare.	0.6653900462340638
Can I perhaps also turn to Mr Patten as well and ask, in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing, to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long-term conflict-causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream EU policies, particularly in development, because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right.	0.8626326501015946
And finally, can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development.	0.859706817131434
We cannot leave it simply to governments.	0.332941147090862
I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra.	0.46397677431802226
They constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective European Security and Defence Policy.	0.5090930956861387
The creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving EU policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction.	0.7682559215451734
The recognition that the 60 000 strong military force will be involved in both peacemaking and peacekeeping is also appropriate.	0.42079329278703237
However, while all these developments are indeed welcome, I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions.	1.077186897900371
I am anxious to know how effective the EU' s policy planning and early warning unit has been.	0.5671939214653585
While Commissioner Patten' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in Mozambique will be opportune, I would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information.	0.6162576395016908
Would the High Representative be prepared to say to what extent this unit, which has been strongly supported by the committee of which I and Mr Titley are members, assisted in providing early information, analysis and an indication of the policy planning options open to yourselves?	0.9053168624845155
I would also like to support Mr Titley' s comments on an effective role for the Parliament in this whole area.	0.6374527262441104
If we are to realise our ambitions in the field of foreign policy, then effective anticipation and preparation for all sorts of crises, particularly humanitarian ones, are essential prerequisites.	0.8427026792446672
When Mr Solana last spoke to this Parliament I was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention, but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way.	0.7839058610419751
We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year, but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with.	0.832423601286251
What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations.	0.793745221347373
We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya.	0.7983535947828351
We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya.	0.8913219628173633
We have large gaps in what we are arguing for, in principle, in relation to human rights.	0.8510139636607938
We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo, and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention.	0.70829622119819
So, I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya.	1.134611450552218
What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end?	0.6236606369022493
We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them, but we are choosing not to use them.	0.8052328787891324
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, I have two questions for you, Mr Solana. How, with credibility, are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the Member States are not prepared to comply with common commitments?	0.9298177334720652
Meetings are all very well, but it is the result that counts.	1.0736135290521887
I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper.	0.6458314023840495
If we look around, the reality is that the CFSP is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk. Take, for example, Germany' s defence savings.	0.7158906875737516
These are not only of concern to the defence minister, Mr Scharping. Instead, they also affect the whole of Europe.	1.03994550040133
In my own country, Sweden, the objective, and the commitment towards playing our part, is to supply 2 500 men for EU operations.	0.8464557297446609
In the present situation, the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men, due to reduced defence spending.	0.7199659931464734
If we translate this number into figures for the EU countries as a whole, which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place, we shall not have 60 000 men but, at best, 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003.	0.9576419065974571
My second question concerns the following matter. Some weeks ago, you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media, whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters.	0.621891031064316
I should like, however, to know the background to this, namely whether, as High Representative, you have been toying at all with the idea of giving Austria special treatment in the context of your assignment and, if so, on whose mandate and with how much leeway.	0.9001539336538482
I am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the High Representative.	0.9060858106864171
I will not detain the Parliament for long but perhaps I could make one or two points and begin, which is sometimes rather dangerous in any Parliament, by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality.	0.7343915242878581
Mrs Pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail I think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow.	0.5971134168385187
I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject.	0.6418556147232326
I spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the NATO parliamentary assembly and Members of this Parliament.	0.6063132468691336
Many of you were there on that occasion and I think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a knife among many of the NATO parliamentary delegates when we spoke about Europe' s ambitions in the area of CFSP.	0.769919777626591
This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well.	0.6924761137278366
As I said in my remarks, I felt when I was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to laugh or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the High Representative' s remarks today were extremely encouraging.	0.9377040511606173
	-0.0
We have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time, but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves, for example, facing up to difficult questions about resources.	0.7761916507967315
Many people will argue that of course all that is required in Europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but I suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the Member States about whether that really is enough, about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own Union.	0.924003551413103
I would just like to say a word about the non-military aspects of our security policy, of conflict prevention and crisis management.	0.857551802738286
Rightly, the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that.	0.7427176241649064
We will be bringing forward to the Council before Lisbon our proposals on a rapid reaction facility so that we can provide assistance where it is required, not in months or years, but in days or weeks.	0.9603227466202007
We are establishing a Commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative' s policy unit.	0.519041072734839
Additionally, and this is for me the most important area of all, an area where we are breaking new ground, we will, soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility, be bringing forward proposals as well on non-military headline goals.	0.9498451099643054
It is, I repeat, breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in Kosovo, policing elsewhere, is the most dramatic and obvious example.	0.897094305117789
It is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner.	0.7227859395408013
I grew up as a kid hoping I would be allowed to stay up on Saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community policeman called Dixon of Dock Green.	0.6017491090531573
I have just been writing a report before I came to this job, and writing a very good report, just to respond to my honourable friend, on policing in part of my own country.	0.9846744913042212
I remember talking about community policing to some American police experts and saying 'What in your view is the ideal community police officer' and the reply was 'a black grandmother' .	0.4926316241447707
But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo.	0.6321555033327174
We have armed forces, we have all got experience of training community police officers.	0.7598060088313332
What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing.	0.590312323000775
We need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well.	0.4705335845477289
That is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the European Union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences.	1.1210433426879096
So again, rhetoric and reality.	0.3505481101545156
Now Mr Titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate.	0.5934208163177813
One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject.	0.6708614684818172
But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon.	0.5055173236767991
I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights, between neglecting habeas corpus, between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance, between tyranny and between environmental degradation.	0.713738110602141
All those things come together.	0.23688376388011634
We talk about the complexities of our eco-system but there is an eco-system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like Mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the Balkans as well.	0.7703212098316888
So, in the coming months, we will be producing communications from the Commission, for example, which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises.	1.1141342606868743
We will be producing a communication shortly on an issue which this Parliament feels passionately about, that is, how we can ensure that election observation is conducted as comprehensively and sensibly as possible without diminishing the integrity of the institutions which do it.	0.6985532139425668
We will be producing a communication on anti-personnel landmines, actually the use of sensor equipment.	0.7120811751497576
The work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in Mozambique.	0.9339211467873005
They have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the wells, they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools.	0.4959328788617751
What does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days, moving those anti-personnel mines around?	0.705983468367703
We are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise.	0.6056633633332364
What we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that connects with our policies elsewhere.	0.8390411117893555
We have to be looking at what we do with the stocks of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine, in Moldova, the ecological consequences of dealing with those stocks, the financial consequences of dealing with those stocks, the political consequences of dealing with those stocks.	0.8938109061151307
So the point I want to make is that all these things are intimately related.	0.723990216179265
We have all the instruments, we have all the instruments that we require but we have to pull them together much more effectively than we have in the past and that is the challenge which the High Representative and I face in the next four or five years.	1.1277523882542
Now, I hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric.	0.8395560353761004
We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them - Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo.	0.8962320832736997
	-0.0
Those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the Balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians, quite a few senators and congressmen who say 'How can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep?' .	0.6837326221147295
So the big test for us is going to be in the Balkans. I hope that all those heads of government, all those prominent politicians in our Member States who promised the earth in the Balkans, who promised Marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the Balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the Balkans.	0.9021894709587065
I would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the European Council, the General Affairs Council and Ecofin.	0.9648885048504662
All on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver.	0.8770551034276369
In the last few months in this job I have heard promises that we will do more in Latin America, I have heard promises that if there is a Middle East peace settlement, we will be there to pay for it.	1.028295790205439
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses.	0.7532143512012996
I have heard promises that we will secure democracy in Indonesia by giving more assistance to Indonesia	0.5445881766551003
Where is the beef?	0.18082790184572012
And that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy.	0.9746189682464874
That is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view.	1.2369031336655611
One reason why I am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that I do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality, the response is 'Oh but we know you are not running things efficiently, we know that you have not spent all your commitments, we know there is some money in your back pocket' .	0.8693867008032267
I want us to be in a position in which we can say: 'It is not like that any more. We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can' .	1.0863080003598546
So, Member States, we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between Council conclusions, between yards of communiqués and what we can actually deliver on the ground and I think that if we can achieve that the job of the High Representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better.	0.9740437209036046
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	0.5834953176753255
I would also like to thank you for allowing us to sample your British sense of humour in the course of our dealings with this very difficult issue, for it makes things a little more interesting.	0.7726446829219146
Women in the decision-making process	0.24275564405190803
The next item is the declarations by the Council and the Commission on women in the decision-making process.	0.7943647430493096
Mr President, two centuries ago, during the French Revolution, a very famous woman, Olympe de Gouges, was executed and proclaimed mad because she had supported equal rights for men and women.	0.719653969331481
Two centuries later, we have achieved a great deal in Europe.	1.007569676392191
The last century was marked by three periods.	0.42362524294917414
The first period was a period of institutional change, change in the legislative framework and huge constitutional victories in all the Member States as a result of the fight by the women' s movement, as a result of major decisions by progressive parties and as the result of action by enlightened men and women.	0.7694519228825719
This was followed by a second period, in which the worth of female models was recognised.	0.6882063054210846
There were women everywhere.	0.19031728336802528
Prime ministers, members of parliament, ministers, in the professional arena, doctors, lawyers, pilots, generals.	0.6082365779234412
We are now in a third period: in this third period, the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed.	0.9119003911420435
The composition, or rather the change in composition, will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes.	0.8134249732910943
Ladies and gentlemen, the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events: the first was the election of the President of Finland, Mrs Halïnen.	0.9868839631877996
For the first time in Finland, the women candidates outnumbered the men.	0.7114184576242276
And a woman was elected.	0.26330292254650683
The second event took place in France, which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in April 1999 at the 'Women and Men in Power' conference, at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio.	0.7927656024819683
We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner.	0.41497283493551973
A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States.	0.8766090023040969
But the figures tell the true story.	0.3427768199087201
And the figures still give Europe cause for concern.	0.33715354938406417
24% of members of government are women and there are an average of 22% in parliament, although this fluctuates from 6% in some Member States to as many as 40% in others.	0.9354805110656705
The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small.	0.5082954888121026
Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%.	0.8593290177980187
What we need, therefore, is to promote specific policies.	0.9355079996186688
We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively.	0.837025547994458
We need organisation and statistical monitoring.	0.26195243424402637
We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture, mentality and specific problems of each area.	0.3978790368913335
And, of course, these policies need a budget, they need to be given financial teeth.	0.8897149299083352
Increasing the number of women or, as the French prime minister put it, increasing the influence of women in the decision-making centres, is the best way of renewing the policy, of reshaping the approach to the question, of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience: the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up.	0.9470257746427581
The recent initiative by the Finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision-making centres is extremely important.	0.5918797254757399
These indicators include national parliaments, regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every Member State.	0.5687425976760573
I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets, compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool.	0.7536134088116526
The programme which I shall present for the fifth women' s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring.	0.6664821736531423
Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned, the same cannot be said for the private sector.	0.8784247247559486
My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light.	0.4361409457095066
There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2% of the directors and managers are women.	0.7284691427400466
Nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision-making centres.	0.605821960658582
Here too, specific efforts will be made of course; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature, but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices; in all cases, my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results.	0.8570371867041923
As you know, Europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within.	0.6933335739382411
A decision has already been taken on quotas of 40% for each sex on all teams and on all research and technological development programmes.	0.6256318589273241
It was approved by the House in May 1999, when the need for women in research and technology was stressed.	0.9388496134149775
We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together, as can be seen from the reform of the Commission, to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission.	1.0443755703111002
Ladies and gentlemen, there are often objections, crypto-progressive objections, as to whether there should be a binding undertaking on the representation of women at the centres of power.	0.7097574870685307
No one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say.	0.5734627091148633
And at the level of the European Union, the question of whether the 15 Member States need to be represented on every committee will never be asked.	0.8746855315725255
Why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population.	0.5075219040593983
I should like to be absolutely categorical.	0.8014007624564663
There should be no reservation, no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power.	0.5716140476795509
(Applause)	-0.0
Women make up half the population, half the strength of the planet.	0.5339223770623155
Excluding women from the centres of power means, first, democratic failure and, secondly, under-exploitation of human resources.	0.7766574264109501
We face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles.	0.5991603278592592
I am optimistic that we shall succeed.	0.8543817228376543
The bet before us is a bet with time.	0.3975526318145092
Future generations of women must not be sidelined.	0.5339486885729088
If need be, we must use all possible means to force the situation.	0.8948064886742589
(Applause)	-0.0
Mr President, firstly I must thank Mrs Belém Roseira for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject.	0.8746238287738062
I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words.	0.831587814191525
The various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under-represented in the decision-making process, in both the political and the economic and social spheres.	0.8593859197690561
Nobody nowadays disputes that women should participate in political life, in the parties and in the institutions but it is not easy to agree on how this participation should be achieved.	0.9131001107084007
The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work. This involves both equality in accessing work, which implies equality in training, and equal pay for the same work, so often defended and yet far from being achieved.	0.8524538643090865
We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole.	0.6462493269149044
Women always have a different viewpoint from men. This serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us, who are dedicated to active politics, undertake to solve.	0.7255761912469469
The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making.	0.7320789163698141
In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women.	0.6983391496720607
However, this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men.	0.7416429546565014
Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent.	0.6762960122047773
The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women.	0.8475921133116476
There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women, who are ready and able, to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process.	0.9307694972241378
There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system.	0.709115561392094
Some Members have even come out against this.	0.4334145220931843
Personally, I would not want to feel like a quota, to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman.	1.1256838387167671
This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference.	0.8677536488675702
Mr President, I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for good speeches on their part which I think provide hope for real optimism, especially given the will and commitment radiated by both women.	0.8153513296491313
I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women.	0.8287341050388467
It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear, what we are concerned with here.	0.9374865522593405
I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission - but then, of course, she is young and full of energy.	0.9050850601844326
I am convinced that it will be hard work, when all is said and done.	0.7242615101506629
If the Commissioner asks for support from Parliament, she can in any case count upon the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	0.7006976105110168
We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality.	0.8820326546078184
I would say to the Portuguese minister that I completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power.	0.8138167079689103
That is absolutely crucial.	0.5886380716281554
It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women.	0.8414273575044717
Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children.	1.0121903384270527
Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today.	1.0345047127233384
Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves.	1.1031337157517658
What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides' surrendering power.	0.8920855258159927
The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden.	0.722942411875402
Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark.	0.7940562454701107
And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark.	0.936228346715084
In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland.	1.0043879286068527
We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing.	0.9845298245468282
I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources.	0.731429518483732
It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term.	0.8160775711034765
In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated.	0.7364587616129784
The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures.	0.6313968256832537
One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments.	0.8721952530465276
I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures.	0.7084308687817202
In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up.	0.8041253975360066
There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally.	0.9516807257708418
The first is the issue of the media' s influence.	0.7238400868128329
I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish.	0.7417444838667567
Do we have a special problem in this regard?	1.2772795056137038
I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question.	0.8309373594240024
I have a suspicion that this is the case, but I am not certain.	1.3570986439511703
The second point is the enlargement of the Union.	0.7238980686889135
I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned.	0.9544247975748598
I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner' s statement; it is time that fine words were translated into action.	0.868322521095345
We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves.	0.8239408014402162
I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems.	0.8010085944576483
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this.	0.3146024399781433
Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process.	0.4791974368248694
In the meantime, we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures.	0.9137816605603246
We can learn from the successes mentioned, not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected, but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system.	0.833884447916099
I am pleased to say that in Wales, which I represent, 40% of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but, on the other hand, we have only 4 women MPs from Wales in the House of Commons which is only 10% of the total; so statements of principle, of support in principle, are not enough because they have not worked.	0.9763507869663626
If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen.	0.9787754668071763
Mr President, at the Second International Conference of Socialist Women held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided that the main demand of the time, that of a woman' s right to vote, should be linked to the women' s question as a whole and that (as also stated in the relevant resolution) Women' s Day must be accorded an international dimension and be thoroughly prepared for.	0.8695881383420692
It is also worth noting that International Women' s Day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years.	0.7083846889598231
In 1910, a woman' s right to vote was on the agenda.	0.714477689188313
Today, we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process.	0.6869756719588858
Women are no homogenous collective.	0.2672656872123816
Women belong to different social classes.	0.2605655362548093
Women have different individual needs and interests.	0.27786673265117473
Irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class, race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work, it is nonetheless a fact that, in all areas of society, the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men (albeit with a few individual exceptions, it is perhaps best to add).	0.8231063173925137
In my own country, Sweden, a number of political parties have, in recent years, voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run.	0.614007558378379
This has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which, in turn, has provided opportunities for further research.	0.7335801911980983
What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making?	0.4619330257416565
What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes, so too of course do the types of decisions made.	0.9383943143241763
When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender, the word "qualifications" also crops up.	0.548520262218516
What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined.	0.5189276541181096
It often looks as if men today, as in the past, always have the least defined qualifications.	0.8400803923164204
Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence.	0.8291566866555011
This way of seeing things I consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today' s decision makers.	0.614386085230628
Earlier this year, we requested, here in this Chamber, that 8 March be made into an international holiday.	0.8540622319026673
In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the "Women' s World Marches" which are to begin this spring on International Women' s Day.	0.827488446692686
This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world.	0.5490951290482227
Finally, I want to say, as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close, that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother.	0.931287208228007
We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found.	1.0220656773826249
Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness.	0.8323890724522125
Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics.	0.39924869572138366
It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible.	0.641205194836552
In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors.	0.5315539439311172
The vast majority of them are not members of any party.	0.5983954299634574
In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories.	0.8775376690695392
In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected.	0.8724810506423715
But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates.	0.3992781864387438
Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union.	0.7128819612666859
That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities.	0.9466574635157534
The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system.	0.9037484594826534
On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses.	0.7964778326943368
The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women.	0.6293351991680636
With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions.	0.6456530172975103
It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation.	0.6563835303565982
The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs.	0.532197555154953
On the other hand, such a policy shows a deep contempt for women.	0.6309417458281392
A woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised.	0.4891683359821415
Ladies, have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota?	0.6378676536956411
Women deserve more than a quota.	0.5127871806209071
It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality.	0.675774806749177
Minister, Commissioner, everything you have just said has been very well expressed, even if a few male colleagues, if there are still any in the Chamber, perhaps gnashed their teeth.	0.9350239860175712
I know that there are also some women who do not wish to hear of quotas or even of positive action, because they believe that this positive discrimination humiliates them and marks them forever in their careers.	0.7323726629771409
But the statistics prove it: the positive action, even the quotas, - if they are not applied blindly, without distinction - have increased the number of women in the decision-making process.	1.0118822268625072
That is why we are justified in stating that the use of quotas, as a transitional measure, contributes to balancing out the participation of men and women, particularly in political life.	0.8088910314564334
I should like to take this opportunity to remind the Commissioner of some requests and initiatives of this Parliament which her predecessor did not follow up and which are closer to our hearts than the quotas.	0.7635092750598891
First of all it concerns our report, which was adopted last year on the occasion of International Women' s Day in Strasbourg, which requests the Commission to submit to us a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women.	0.9730672695565966
According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right, and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically.	0.8756470544623859
Things being what they are, nobody should dare any longer to dispute that the right of equality of men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society, requiring equal treatment and equal opportunity be achieved by a package of active measures, including positive action.	0.7729661117887758
Therefore, Commissioner, you can go ahead.	0.9171283467782438
You do not need to wait for a new amendment to the Treaty.	0.9839275939758473
May I just remind you once again of our request for an amendment to the 1976 directive which has been watered down and misapplied with regard to the equal treatment of self-employed people, including assistant spouses.	0.7238789709395603
No action has been taken on our report which unanimously proposed a European framework status for assistant spouses.	0.6005109794875854
Here again, Commissioner, the ball is in your court.	0.6898233607265778
Do not take too long to send it back.	0.5557687282891492
I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the European Parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today.	0.9595467566161605
The presence of women in decision-making bodies, in particular, is a question of democracy.	0.9278493155068823
All citizens, both men and women, should be able to see, to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule.	0.8480288926596711
If we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision-making bodies, it is clear that we are still far from true democracy.	0.8975236837482893
However, it is also a question of political agendas.	1.0175047374727006
In addition to making up the majority of the population, women are also the most dynamic element in society: it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men, and in many of our regions, they are the main feature of the innovation, training, performance and flexibility development model.	0.8735877795660247
Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan, where I live, 90% said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day.	0.8033587606571322
Women work an average of 60 hours a week, which is 20 hours longer than men.	0.589378056432093
The price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time.	0.4765496449000434
If this is true, and it is, any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point.	0.852715089273136
Laws, programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed, coordinated and audacious, in order to encourage the formation of new cultural, economic, social, institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women.	0.6928273470913513
Much has been achieved on many issues in Europe, but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation.	0.8874632322741304
I agree with the Commissioner that it is time for the European political sphere - the entire European political sphere - to represent women and men on an equal footing, and for decisive action to be taken in this matter.	1.133977294211385
Mr President, before I came here for today' s sitting, I was watching Finnish television.	0.9585651664577578
In Finland, an honorary company of the Finnish army was saluting the new President of the Republic, with the words "Good morning, Madam President."	0.8204282570652323
You perhaps know that, in Finland, the president is not just the leading public figure or political leader, but she is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, so this was quite an interesting and historic occasion.	0.9354177693072144
During the Finnish presidential term, a report was produced that reveals an image of the whole decision-making process, and, on the basis of this report, I hope that the Commissioner proposes legally binding ways of improving the position of women in decision making.	1.0012559984276723
I urge you all, women of the Right, to listen to Mrs Lulling, because she told us why quotas were needed and, if any of us has sufficient experience of political life, it is she.	0.9364625837625771
Finally, I would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.8798732256854259
I appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen, not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4, to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference.	0.7258150570869467
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, despite the progress made in terms of legislation and despite the complaints that we all utter from time to time on the subject of sexual inequality and sexual discrimination, the causes of these practices are still present in the amendments that have been tabled to this resolution. This means that we need to amend policies in various areas if we are to guarantee that women can participate on equal terms in the decision-making process.	0.8120389462222892
We know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve, both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility.	0.7779652000467446
The truth is that the scant participation of women in centres of political representation and decision making demonstrates a democratic deficit which is incompatible with genuine democracy.	0.6095088023777073
It is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the Council, the Commission and each Member State strictly to respect the commitments they have made, particularly at the Beijing Conference.	1.0236512217643987
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am a right-wing Member of Parliament but I have the same battles as my colleagues in supporting and assisting fellow citizens in my country to gain power and access to decision-making posts, which should be feasible not only in the political arena but clearly also in all sectors of society.	0.9055975858492334
Quite simply, I would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and I am particularly against the system of quotas, because I believe it is especially contemptuous of women and I come from a country where parity has just been achieved.	1.0506079294085078
It is quite logical, it is consistent!	0.7762934651179101
It should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50%, if not more, of those within decision-making bodies and, inter alia, in the political arena.	0.9094404036842668
So, there should be no positive discrimination to include women.	0.8128521302559218
Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense.	0.43864636516662414
When I see that we are asking for training for women in politics, I want to say - no, definitely not.	1.0174605904259932
Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training?	0.5227121857009135
That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority.	0.2150245634274159
But I do know that we have never felt inferior to men, particularly in politics.	0.9531847456078003
So I believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow countrywomen to achieve decision-making power, to gain responsible posts in the political arena, but I believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think.	0.9794737691945449
We shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women' s participation in the political decision-making process.	0.6972991502150903
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, "Women are half of heaven" , a successful man once said.	0.7309209356458332
But when it comes to important decisions and priorities, there is a lack of women' s voices.	0.6282906634502214
Women, who constitute more than half of the population, are heavily under-represented within political, economic and social fields.	0.8973071751427634
That is unacceptable in a democracy.	0.623433232669812
Where equality is concerned, the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making.	0.6631079872941457
If we are to achieve a balance, a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required.	0.9697533364225694
An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women' s full participation in power structures and decision making.	0.643055577098517
I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind.	0.9297731039056591
I propose that the EU' s objectives for women in the area of decision making should be based upon the averaged-out achievements of the three most successful Member States within each area, with the Member States each submitting a report annually which will then have to be evaluated.	0.854160124599583
Women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape, sexual offences, domestic violence and the trade in women, but they are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies which pronounce upon these crimes.	0.7275425433045347
The latter are consequently accorded low priority, and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted.	0.7218276716627973
Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under-represented in peace-keeping efforts, conflict resolution and reconstruction work.	0.588762215826608
In the resolution, we therefore urge the Member States to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace-keeping.	0.9893828119830583
The call for women' s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy; it is also essential if women' s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full.	0.7996408253181492
Not to use women' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste.	0.6155387101179568
Women should not only be "half of heaven" but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet.	0.7923177912699297
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today.	0.7673564109503075
We have high hopes for what you will achieve.	0.3914578083442132
We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions.	0.7801682345859802
We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large, we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women, and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today.	0.8274422344240309
Furthermore, we want values that women consider important, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security and environmental protection, to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and, if possible, throughout the world.	1.0263303478047858
In order to achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has, until now, been essentially imbued with masculine values.	0.8525716025207736
We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for.	0.5721083878501744
Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory: not over men, not over anyone, but the victory of equality between men and women.	0.8212327874996789
We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities, and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now, and particularly women, concerns the new economy and the new information technologies.	0.9208745622980676
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women.	0.8359490481808889
The rate of employment in Europe, which is much lower than in the United States and Japan, must be increased.	0.9746376604081459
We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall.	1.256114138211823
I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit to ensure that the new economy and the new Europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women.	0.9471820527235308
Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why I was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the Member States where the political representation of women is a success, such as, for example, in Finland, France and Sweden, and equally, you had the courage to list the Member States where things in this respect are not going so well, such as, for example, my own country and Greece too, which you forgot to mention.	0.9014995348658694
Moreover, I have heard that for the next elections, it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece.	1.0533790917778574
I think this is a very sad state of affairs.	0.9306142140090102
I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda.	0.8885710008399244
This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution.	1.0488751650472243
I myself, Commissioner, am a product of quotas. I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result.	0.8687210832098838
It appears that the meritocracy in a number of our European countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance.	0.5375398726113605
It is true that a number of countries in the European Union have already introduced quotas, and you yourself made reference to Belgium, Commissioner, where it has not really taken off.	1.0046388071667183
Hardly surprising, would you not agree, Mrs Avilés Perea, not because we failed to find the necessary candidates, but because recent scientific research, instigated by the Commission, has shown that quotas are, in fact, only useful if women are placed in the appropriate safe seats.	0.9764254109779519
This is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas.	0.7804605716332088
Indeed, Minister, we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract.	0.858503064357598
But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this.	0.5463880846825812
The electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one-for-one system, as is being applied in Sweden on a voluntary basis.	0.7476269419570117
I would suggest the following: where possible, apply it on a voluntary basis, where there is reluctance, impose it.	0.6764064296848262
I hope that in the fifth action programme, Minister and Commissioner, benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through, for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this.	0.9313353632767293
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council for their solid recommendations and, above all, for their proposals.	0.9351194888384947
Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women' s rights, I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, to today' s debate.	0.8303984140831127
In an article entitled "If women ruled the world" , he maintains that if women were more involved in politics, the world would certainly not be so wedded to violence.	0.7166215641150314
Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, may have been a female model in Ancient Greece, but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace.	0.7766823951049381
There are, therefore, serious grounds, over and above justice between the sexes, for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women.	0.6514582466756118
Women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue, reconciliation, an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means.	0.6013464622629648
These female virtues can offer an alternative to today' s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone.	0.5431974876137601
That is why the Intergovernmental Conference must introduce into the Treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the European Union and in all democratic institutions and political decision-making centres throughout the Community.	0.9840789228555719
Mr President, why do women need their rightful share in political decision making?	0.5795621042545165
And how should we achieve this?	0.35604655021623205
We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary.	1.1166362312416291
It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and, as such, a condition for political legitimacy.	0.8977594462133461
But if we look into how to achieve this, the opinions are greatly divided.	0.7736817047732757
Is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment, much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties?	0.7891734446581932
And is it then up to the state, in other words the legislative, to impose such measures on political parties?	0.9077142531934822
Or should we even consider a system in which 50% of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies?	0.5926268945055566
This discussion, which is being held in some parts of Europe and here too under the French banner of parité, touches the very core of democracy, and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman.	0.8901018818736915
In my opinion, the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level.	0.6035360184863826
I am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists, without which, in fact, I would not be here today.	0.9848510178844434
Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure.	0.9120336214337834
In my opinion, though, the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties, at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself.	0.7431557841439934
In other words, the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid.	0.6527036424215029
We would, in this way, violate democracy.	0.7604101429361174
Mr President, today' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision-making bodies and changes to the decision-making system in Europe.	0.8108104447715312
We have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors, education, work, culture.	0.7839449702579093
The problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision-making centres.	0.9527647827426184
The debate is a deeply political one.	0.619059167275843
There are two approaches.	0.6274147404340357
The first is a policy of persuasion.	0.9375230409078613
Gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved.	0.3824334023421439
Three comments: the first is based on the fact that women are able. I can, therefore all women can.	1.1374058469433834
How do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded?	0.5902883428719936
