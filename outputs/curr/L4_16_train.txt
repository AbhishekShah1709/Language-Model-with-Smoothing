Between 1988 and 1991, group 1 and 2 patients received implant tissue-supported prostheses (using two to four implants).	0.7524269043629795
Due to prosthesis-related pressure lesions, the strategy has now been changed.	0.5134683511462379
Since 1992, group 1 patients have received exclusively implant-supported prostheses (using five to six implants), while group 2 patients have received implant tissue-supported constructions (using four implants).	0.6748674093367607
Special criteria for the success of implant-supported maxillofacial prosthetics were drawn up.	0.5736291983154174
With an average follow-up period of 37 months, 160 fixtures (91%) were clinically osseointegrated.	0.737871594551845
Both types of restoration provided sufficient oral rehabilitation.	0.24919437878565898
However, only completely implant-supported prostheses avoided soft tissue ulcers.	0.6288396500887382
The overall success rate was about 77% after 7 years in group 1 and about 87% after 9 years in group 2.	0.8585787429986306
With regard to implants placed after strategy change, the 5-year success rate was approximately 86% (group 1) and 94% (group 2).	0.7674544816497815
In irradiated patients, an exclusively implant-supported prosthesis without any mucosal contact (thus avoiding soft tissue ulcers with a potential to develop osteoradionecrosis) should therefore be fabricated.	0.5689229253474335
Implant tissue-supported restoration is also possible in nonirradiated oral cancer patients.	0.5217647657398181
Extracorporal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been postulated as an additional therapeutic option in nonunion after fracture treatment.	0.5974429946010084
We have reexamined patients with nonunions treated at our institution to evaluate the efficacy of the method.	0.6282164620664131
In a prospective nonrandomized study patients were investigated with a minimum duration of nonunion of 6 months.	0.7735384960613463
Following 2 cycles of ESWT with 2000 impulses/18 kV, the reevaluation was performed at 1, 3 and 6 months after treatment.	0.6922109863304977
A total of 27 pseudarthroses was reevaluated, in 11 one or more reosteosyntheses had been performed prior to ESWT.	0.6586103021112686
Following ESWT we found a success rate of 41 % (n = 11).	0.675597494000451
The clinical evidence of subjective, clinical improvement was found in 5 of these patients within 1 month, in all of these patients within a period of 3 months.	0.9068924401383185
Radiologic evidence of improvement occurred in none of these patients within 1 month, in all of these patients within 6 months.	0.8294305928315283
ESWT appears to represent an additional treatment option in patients with longstanding nonunion.	0.5610364291481501
If no improvement occurs, the maximum delay of reosteosynthesis is three months.	0.533982455193411
Over a period of 11 years a total of 140 liver resections for non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine hepatic metastases were performed in 127 patients (73 women, 54 men; median age 53 years).	0.5935821223683515
There were 120 first, 14 second and 6 third liver resections.	0.4874765291893004
Primary tumors were: breast cancer (n = 34), leiomyosarcoma (n = 20), pancreatic cancer (n = 16), renal cell carcinoma (n = 13), melanoma (n = 9), gastric cancer (n = 9), lung cancer (n = 6) and adrenal cancer (n = 6) and miscellaneous tumors (n = 14).	0.5589206850160384
Extrahepatic tumor manifestation (including synchronous primary tumors) was found in 69/140 cases (49 %); 61 of 120 patients with a first liver resection had extrahepatic tumor (51 %).	0.7585477005786065
In the 120 first liver resections, 82 (68 %) R0, 13 (11 %) R1 and 25 (21 %) R2 excisions were possible.	0.7056318356976358
Median survival after first liver resection was 20 months; after R0 resection a median survival of 28 months and after R1/2 resection of 8 months was achieved.	0.6080699914377574
The 5-year survival rate was 16 % for the total group, 24 % in patients with R0 resection and 0 % for R1/2 resections.	0.9518327946021893
After a second liver resection (n = 14) there was a median survival of 28 months (5-year-survival-rate of 21 %) for all patients and of 41 months (5-year survival rate 38 %) after R0 resection.	0.8633742006289734
Morbidity and mortality after the first liver resection were 32.5 % and 5.8 %, respectively.	0.9724718946792527
In patients without extrahepatic tumor at the time of the first liver resection a median survival of 32 months (5-year survival rate 25 %) and 7 months was achieved after R0 resection and R1/2 resection, respectively.	0.8010375293803341
In case of extrahepatic tumor the median survival was 24 months (5-year survival rate 23 %) for R0 resection compared to 8 months after R1/2 resection.	0.6998681925200888
These data suggest that not the presence of extrahepatic tumor but rather the possibility of a R0 resection is most decisive for the prognosis after liver resection.	0.6417878843377443
We conclude that patients with liver metastases of non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine tumors may benefit from liver resection.	0.5413717655452983
Similar to colorectal metastases, a second or third liver resection can be worthwhile in selected cases.	0.4988379949139235
Even in more unfavorable tumor entities, several cases of long-term survival were observed after surgical therapy.	0.7532036914003576
Therefore, the indication for liver resection should be considered carefully in every single case.	0.7151007692994839
Generalizations about the outcomes of psychotherapy are essentially based on research on brief therapies with quite short follow-up.	0.38659637063484603
The present paper is a survey of some of the findings in an effectiveness study of psychoanalysis and long-term psychotherapy, typically psychoanalytically oriented, in private practice.	0.7189867602436927
The design was a three-wave panel comprising more than 700 patients.	0.4230432885008562
At the end of the third wave, 418 patients in different phases of treatment remained in the sample.	0.42139612564416523
Across a reconstructed time scale covering roughly seven years, before, during, and after treatment, the 74 psychoanalysis cases described a very positive development, whereas the development among the 331 psychotherapy cases was moderately positive.	0.6771240879707066
The findings emphasize the importance of extended follow-up.	0.41924867142915384
When therapist variables are considered, therapeutic experience had complex or mixed associations with patients outcome.	0.42985777915276446
Especially positive were high age and many years, in private practice, after licensing.	0.629085279986752
Therapeutic ideals and attitudes divided the therapist group in three subgroups, one of which was characterized by purely classical psychoanalytic views on the values of support, friendliness etc.	0.5223618857365945
Therapists in the classically psychoanalytic cluster were found to do poorly with patients in psychotherapy, in contrast to patients in psychoanalysis.	0.6609575859533147
It is concluded that psychoanalysis and psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy are qualitatively different.	0.3564296248628135
Experimental studies and open clinical trials have suggested intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) as a potentially effective treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).	0.6609584331882568
The Austrian Immunoglobulin in Multiple Sclerosis (AIMS) study tested this assumption by examining 148 patients with relapsing-remitting MS in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled fashion (75 IVIg, 73 placebo).	0.49733509380696433
Monthly administration of IVIg in a dosage of 0.15-0.20 g/kg over a period of 2 years slowed the progression of or even reversed disability as evident in a total of 24% of patients and almost halved the number of relapses in comparison to placebo treatment.	0.6579130535216454
Therapeutic efficacy was noted within the first 6 months of treatment and was not correlated to the severity of disability (mild neurological sins without disability to ambulatory with assistance) at study entry.	0.6726929968085096
Overall the magnitude of treatment effects of IVIg was comparable to that reported for beta-interferon and copolymer 1.	0.551084663870547
Further ongoing studies will have to clarify the future role of IVIg in the treatment of MS, in particular in the progressive forms of the disease.	0.7232622722274514
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare cause of ischemic heart disease.	0.6136774304675945
Incidence, etiology and optimal treatment are ill-defined.	0.38316592980812586
Between July 1995 and December 1997, we prospectively identified 42 patients (36 men, six women, mean age 59 +/- 12 years) with spontaneous coronary artery dissection among 3803 consecutive angiographic examinations in which the diagnosis of coronary artery disease was established for the first time (incidence 1.1%).	0.7681031528293166
In comparison to the remaining study population with stable angina pectoris (8 cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection among 2852 patients; incidence: 0.3%), the incidence of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was significantly higher in the patient subgroups with acute myocardial infarction (13/450; 2.9%) and with unstable angina pectoris or postinfarction angina (21/501; 4.2%).	0.7755865534404146
Dissection was most frequently located in the left anterior descending coronary artery (19 cases), followed by the right coronary artery (15 cases) and the left circumflex coronary artery (8 cases).	0.8552866349091757
Because of an ambiguous angiographic lesion appearance intravascular ultrasound imaging was performed in 13 patients to confirm the diagnosis.	0.6012273404946067
The presumed etiology of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was atherosclerotic plaque rupture in 35 cases, heavy physical exercise in four cases and hormonal influences related to pregnancy and contraception in one case.	0.5016291114706519
In two cases, no obvious risk factor could be identified.	0.6465018951528891
Therapy consisted of intracoronary stenting in 24 patients (including ten patients with acute myocardial infarction), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 8 patients and balloon angioplasty (PTCA) in seven patients.	0.7814891253654257
Three patients were treated conservatively.	0.8141882564123243
Introduction: Since the introduction of laparoscopic hernioplasty the TAPP procedure (transabdominal preperitoneal approach) has become the most widely used technique.	0.6776726626470008
Many surgeons have changed to the total extraperitoneal approach (TEP), because they fear the consequences of a peritoneal lesion.	0.5607993910450074
Method: We evaluated our results with TAPP in a retrospective study, with special attention to complications caused by the approach.	0.7928915679038774
We operated on 460 hernias in 390 patients in a period of 5 years.	0.5378435926533319
Results: Complication rates and recurrence rates were similar to those after TEP.	0.6300180658454438
There was a marked learning curve with decrease of both rates during the evaluated years.	0.491417918171963
There were no complications related to the transabdominal approach other than trocar hernias, the rate of which could be reduced by eliminating the learning curve and by using smaller trocar diameter.	0.6686824536775811
Conclusion: We see no reason to change from TAPP to the TEP technique.	0.5056561663482744
This article examines the use and acceptance of ticket machines, automatic teller machines (ATMs) and telephone cards by the elderly in four European regions.	0.4954429511377402
The analyses are based on data from an international project entitled "Keeping the Elderly Mobile", collected in Mannheim (former West Germany; N=404 home-dwelling respondents), Chemnitz (former East Germany; N=400), Ancona (Italy; N=600), and Jyväskylä (Finland; N=618).	0.45666938377635424
The random sample was stratified by age and gender in each country.	0.33808158387766124
Two generations of men and women (aged 55-74 and 75+ years, respectively) participated in the study.	0.6050290028093941
Results show that respondents generally made little use of the three technologies under investigation: in fact, the majority of respondents does not use them at all.	0.6625942078806122
The most frequently used devices were ATMs in Chemnitz and ticket machines and telephone cards in Mannheim.	0.4125038548498629
On the basis of logistic regression analysis, age was the most important explanatory factor for the three technologies and for all four regions, i.e., the users were mostly the "young-old."	0.6760283123019701
Education was a more important variable than gender.	0.45705076276163203
In all four regions, the majority of the respondents who used the technologies assessed felt that each of them made life easier; nevertheless, ticket machines make life more difficult to almost every third user in Mannheim.	0.5146538948798891
Interesting differences and similarities among the towns were also found.	0.3295222372150055
The present study exhibits preliminary results regarding elderly and technology which future research should investigate in greater depth.	0.44289427723824454
In order to examine the efficacy of whole body acupuncture additionally applied to drug treatment in depression, a single-blind placebo-controlled study with 70 inpatients administered to three different treatment groups has been carried out.	0.6453832767868928
All patients were pharmacologically treated with the tetracyclic antidepressant mianserin.	0.5932075270908433
The verum group (n=22) received acupuncture at specific points considered to be effective in the treatment of depression.	0.5218965588730614
The placebo group (n=24) was treated with acupuncture at non-specific locations and the control group (n=24) received only pharmacological treatment.	0.6610271449331583
Acupuncture was applied three times a week over a period of four weeks.	0.47841978202966084
Psychopathology was rated by judges blind to verum/placebo conditions twice a week over eight weeks with the CGI, GAS, BRMS and BfS rating scales.	0.36964211992922785
Additionally applied acupuncture improved the course of depression more than pharmacological treatment with mianserin did by itself.	0.4139761829398272
However, we could not detect any differences between placebo and verum acupuncture.	0.667505570151977
Acute heart failure consists of decompensated chronic heart failure, acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.	0.4716141954299283
While decompensated heart failure shows little therapeutic difficulties therapy of pulmonary edema is more sophisticated.	0.4178319215903723
Cardiogenic shock, however is still a therapeutic challenge.	0.8837750248064228
For therapy of cardiogenic shock positive inotropes, phosphodiesterase-inhibitors and various assist devices are currently in use.	0.4885010399409188
If it is not possible to correct underlying diseases, mortality of cardiogenic shock is still high.	0.8046936688245153
Two years after the diagnosis of Sézary syndrome, a 50-year old female patient experienced attacks of painful ischemia of both hands and feet, leading to acral necrosis.	0.6390976182532644
Another 59-year old patient presented with severe pain in his feet, secondary to ischemia.	0.744343866789501
This was the first symptom of a T-cell-chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	0.8013607522189973
Similar cases have only occasionally been described.	0.3971717622205164
The relationship between acral ischemia and T-cell-lymphoma is not clear but is discussed in this article.	0.810225953225203
The clinical features of progression sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo in combina-tion with the radiologic finding of a contrast- enhancing mass within the inner auditory canal are suggestive of an acoustic neuroma.	0.576091962264062
We report our findings in a 57-year-old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease who was presumed to have a neuroma.	0.6727237984852258
A large malignant lymphoma of the cerebellopontine angle presented clinically with a primary acoustic none palsy and no other central neurological deficits.	0.4855970310147156
Both the primary radiological examinations and the exclusively peripheral nerve palsy failed to indicate manifestationes of a lymphoma.	0.455537205481781
The development of a progressive facial palsy within 8 weeks of presentation and an atypi-cal occipital headache were uncommon findings for an acoustic neuroma.	0.49461293466316686
Such changes in symptoms despite the occurrence of car-dinal symptoms require further diagnostic measures.	0.3623665490076606
Manifestations of a malignant lymphoma in the cerebellopontine angle are extremely rare.	0.6051713017586378
To our knowledge a case of an intracerebral lymphoma in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome has never been reported before.	0.7235334010164327
Cutaneous blisters on a corpse are not only of forensic interest regarding their etiology and genesis but also the time of origin, particularly the problem of vital, agonal, supravital or postmortem occurrence of cutaneous blisters could be of forensic value.	0.6434480530746767
The aim of this work was to summarize the causative spectrum of cutaneous blisters, including poisonous plants and animals, drugs and toxic substances.	0.7144508622786008
The time of origin of cutaneous blisters were evaluated in selected forensically relevant cases.	0.698542419260153
The purpose of the present study was to compare two sedation regimens with either propofol (P) or methohexital (M) for elective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with respect to safety, side effects, recovery, and discharge time.	0.8536986126157406
Pharmacological thrombolysis is a valuable therapeutic modality for embolic arterial occlusion.	0.4921295712200881
Nevertheless, thorough evaluation of the indications is imperative to avoid serious complications.	0.5590817864884131
The most frequent complication is hemorrhage.	0.6688371218589416
Of these, the intracerebral hemorrhages are rare, but when they do occur they are an immediate threat to life they are accompanied by very severe complications, and they have an extremely poor prognosis.	0.64116141978267
Within 58 months 361 patients were treated at our neurosurgical clinic with intracerebral hematomas.	0.5849102957520143
In 22 patients (6.1%) the hematoma developed as a complication of systemic thrombolysis.	0.7637255520373718
Two of these patients had been treated for occlusion of the central retinal artery.	1.0190656609708033
One patient died: the other survived but was severely disabled.	0.6868203524863554
The latter patient experienced no benefit from the thrombolysis as for as the underlying ophthalmologic disease was concerned.	0.5129526930855848
These worrying examples stress the necessity for careful evaluation of risk factors and the natural history of the underlying disease for which systemic thrombolysis is indicated.	0.6904282299798671
Local selective (or superselective) thrombolysis is preferable to the systemic procedure, provided that the indications are equally strictly observed and are less likely to lead to severe complications.	0.6266007459082665
We report on a 61-year-old patient with considerable insufficiency of a quadricuspid aortic valve and coronary three vessel disease.	0.5963450120311551
The congenital quadricuspid aortic valve has become symptomatic due to the development of (post-endocarditic) insufficiency only in the advanced stage of life.	0.5888924011126785
It was treated by replacement of the aortic valve and bypass myocardial revascularization.	0.6448595702943031
The physiopathology of quadricuspid aortic valve will be discussed.	0.2776102206106635
Due to its high prevalence, atopic dermatitis is an important problem in the dermatologic practice.	0.7237516000047687
The chronicity of the disease together with numerous triggering factors of varying individual impact create a complex situation which is difficult to manage under the current circumstances in our health care system.	0.531825831130545
We describe the concept of an outpatient clinic especially for atopic dermatitis as established in our Department of Dermatology.	0.7289432105967457
A high degree of standardization is combined with a high measure of individual care.	0.663425895380758
The aims of this clinic are an optimized outpatient management of atopic dermatitis, the gathering of epidemiologic data, the performance of controlled studies, and potentially the reduction of costs.	0.6930160685717401
Abstract:  Traumatic cerebral aneurysms are rare in severely head-injured patients.	0.5593178467125578
We present the first case of a traumatic aneurysm of the A1/A2 junction.	0.6395277203098254
Purpose: Although the relationship between optic pits and macular lesions was described nearly a century ago, the pathology and pathogenesis of macular detachment remain unclear.	0.6141456998840972
Recent OCT studies have shown schisislike spaces in connection with the disc.	0.46767595325741146
None of the hypotheses of pathogenesis proposed so far could have been proven.	0.5303279861326758
Besides the hypothesis of exudation, the role of the vitreoretinal interface is kept in the background of discussion.	0.5770351936825632
We describe a case of macular detachment associated with optic pit that regained full vision after pars plana vitrectomy with laser coagulation and gas tamponade over a follow-up of 26 months.	0.49333139467826953
The purpose of our case report is to emphasize the role of the vitreoretinal interface in the pathogenesis of macular detachment associated with optic pits.	0.6621539896727021
Sclerosing adenosis of the prostate is a benign lesion, which was not recognized until a few years ago.	0.7088641295500351
As in sclerosing adenosis of the breast, a background of various hyperplastic changes is commonly also present in the prostate.	0.5973287300979573
An incidence of 2.8 % was reported in one series of resected hyperplastic prostatic glands.	0.7143965513694128
As demonstrated in this case report, the main problem lies in the differential diagnosis between sclerosing adenosis and highly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	0.7640684529799565
Histological diagnosis of sclerosing adenosis based on routine HE sections is supplemented by immunohistochemical methods.	0.35101221032941493
Important diagnostic criteria of sclerosing adenosis are the presence of basal cell differentiation, which is demonstrated by cytokeratin 903, and signs of possible myoepithelial differentiation, with expression of S-100 and/or smooth muscle actin.	0.7468433390210258
These antibody expressions are lacking with in the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	0.3951307042457056
Nevertheless, in a small number of cases this differential diagnosis remains impossible, even after the application of immunohistochemical methods.	0.8707213628374207
Further studies are needed to shed some light on the relations between sclerosing adenosis, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the prostate.	0.4662845105790136
So far, there appears to be no evidence of a direct relationship between sclerosing adenosis of the prostate and an elevated risk of carcinoma.	0.7814323077234441
Benign intracavitary cardiac tumors lead to "malignant" complications, so early diagnosis and adequate treatment are of vital importance.	0.6023356334343387
Our investigation summarizes a 10-year experience after surgical treatment of 29 patients suffering from benign intracavitary cardiac tumors.	0.5744231325829057
The postoperative histological examination revealed a myxoma in 27 cases; in 2 cases a papillary fibroelastoma was diagnosed.	0.6268090691297605
The main symptom in 19 patients was dyspnea.	0.5559316160172698
In 8 cases an embolic event occurred.	0.45315165924374684
All patients underwent extirpation of the tumor.	0.6630651960807212
Early mortality was 10 %, while late mortality was 4 %.	0.5866912836715817
The treatment of choice of benign intracavitary cardiac tumors is extirpation, which, due to unpredictable embolic complications, is to be carried out immediately should the tumor have a lobulated tuberous surface.	0.6804496444823491
In such cases the descriptive function of echocardiography is of considerable importance.	0.4813434655801863
We present a case of a 48 year old man who complained of progressive dyspnoe.	0.7228266093815326
Radiograph revealed a large tumor in the left lung.	0.8237061300607624
Biopsy was performed and revealed beneath a normal bronchial epithelium polymorph tumor cells admixed with some histiocytes.	0.435547712797932
These tumor cells were strongly pigmented and expressed HMB-45 and protein S-100 immunohistochemically.	0.5223255675399104
Malignant melanoma of the bronchus was included in the differential diagnosis.	0.5272867336107909
A thoracotomy and left lower lobe resection was performed.	0.3994156206035934
The lung is an uncommon localisation of angiomyolipoma with so far three reported cases.	0.517011275602986
Lipoma, leiomyoma and lymphangioleiomyomatosis have to be included in the differential diagnosis.	0.472691512586248
The peculiarity of this case is the presence of multiple pigmented tumor cells that express HMB-45.	0.5895887405082931
This has not been reported yet.	0.7293199948403204
Background: The maximum number of cell divisions of a certain cell population is genetically fixed so that aging cells become non-dividing (senescent) at least.	0.6112074470044588
This replicative life span, also known as "hayflick limit", is probably defined by a "critical" length of the telomeres.	0.6054420929599206
Telomeres are special DNA-sequences located at the four ends of the chromosomes which are shortened with each cell cycle.	0.43385729933535017
Cells of most, but not all malignant tumours have been shown to reactivate the enzyme telomerase so that telomeres can be reconstructed, "Hayflick limit" can be overcome, and unlimited cell division can be established.	0.6702694120655297
This study was undertaken to elucidate whether telomerase reactivation is used by uveal melanoma cells.	0.5107590933932433
A total of 113 patients with acute and chronic instability of the ulnar collateral ligament metacarpal phalangeal (MP) joint of the thumb were treated surgically between 1980 and 1985; 82 patients were followed up after a mean period of 10 years.	0.677039745021908
Of 59 patients with acute injuries, 52 were painfree with full stability of the MP joint; 23 patients with chronic instability and tendon grafting also showed restoration of stability.	0.6177177099543357
Nevertheless, the range of motion was reduced severely and opposition of the thumb was impaired.	0.6654433726028848
The results of follow-up reveal that acute reattachment of the injured ulnar collateral ligament is more effective.	0.614197209781504
The purpose of this study was to assess the role of spiral computed tomography (SCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the preoperative work-up of patients with pancreatic carcinoma, regarding local resectability and vascular involvement.	0.6722427685300945
Methods and materials: A total of 28 patients (19 men and 9 women; mean age 58 years) with known or highly suspected carcinoma of the pancreas were included in this study.	0.7853307028784599
All patients prospectively underwent MRI ( +/-  gadolinium-DTPA) and SCT (3-phase examination) as preoperative diagnostic imaging studies, and laparotomy was carried out within 7 days, irrespective of the MRI or SCT findings.	0.7405093008912561
SCT and MR studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, without knowing the results of the surgical exploration.	0.6890487600810841
Standardized image analysis was correlated with findings at laparatomy.	0.34043491008684945
Results: Laparotomy identified 10 patients to be suitable for surgical resection and 18 pancreatic carcinomas to be unresectable.	0.5684152913582473
In 17 of 18 non-resectable carcinomas MRI and SCT were able to obtain correct information about unresectability (sensitivity 94 %), in 7 (MRI), resp.	0.6241008463006613
8 (SCT) carcinomas were correctly considered to be resectable (sensitivity 70 % for MRI and 80 % for SCT).	0.7947008426897062
The presence of vascular involvement was depicted by SCT with a sensitivity of 82-100 % and 62-100 % by MRI.	0.6561867432648014
The specificity varied between 85-100 % for SCT and 77-100 % for MRI.	0.7943331293146731
Conclusion: Both MRI and SCT are good techniques for the preoperative work-up of pancreatic carcinomas in order to obtain a correct assessment of local resectability.	0.6797463921176159
Pancreatic pseudocysts occur as a complication in the natural course of acute or chronic pancreatitis, with a spontaneous resolution rate of 40 % to 60 %.	0.8031122727174721
The incidence of pseudocysts in the course of chronic pancreatitis amounts to 60 %.	0.5450426799891945
Pseudocysts have to be differentiated from neoplastic or congenital pancreatic cystic lesions.	0.42111660105327703
Careful diagnostic work-up including ERCP and CT scanning is mandatory in the management of pancreatic pseudocysts.	0.39008443828797784
The indication for treatment depends on the development of symptoms or complications.	0.5914762325088238
Pain is present in up to 90 % of all patients, and the rate of complications varies between 2 % and 55 %.	0.9129691310377193
Pancreatic pseudocysts are usually an epiphenomenon of chronic pancreatitis.	0.4983042769613257
Pancreatic resection therefore represents a causative treatment.	0.23574157917225524
New percutaneous and endoscopic techniques for draining pseudocysts are challenging the previous hegemony of the surgeon.	0.3555153831229036
However, so far no prospectively collected data are available comparing the results of interventional and surgical drainage procedures.	0.6980201028686492
Therefore, in most symptomatic cases surgery is considered the treatment of choice.	0.8483443146548922
A 28-year-old drug addict who had injected intravenously died of hepatic failure and coma caused by fulminant hepatitis (simultaneously: hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C and superinfection by delta hepatitis).	0.4672140039534434
Liver histology disclosed cirrhosis with severe necrotizing hepatitis and extensive microvesicular steatosis, compatible with a delta virus infection.	0.31520612386756724
Moderate pulmonary fat embolism (grade I-II according to Falzi) was accompanied by fat deposits in alveolar macrophages.	0.6100552212763275
It is postulated that protracted fat mobilization from necrotizing hepatocytes may be the cause of pulmonary fat embolism; the extravasation of fat from the vessels into the alveoli results in phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages.	0.4887933541095265
Suicide on railways (either by being run over by or jumping in front of a train) is one of the 'hardest' suicide methods.	0.5189983274596255
In Austria, 617 suicides or attempted suicides on railways were registered between 1990 and 1994.	0.3275161464434289
This amounts to 5.73 % of all suicides committed in this period with women showing a higher percentage than men.	0.6627912342257005
In both men and women there was a predominance of younger age groups; the mean age was higher in women than in men (48.0 vs 40.4 years).	0.8107323288021192
There was a significant increase in suicides or attempted suicides on railways after a television report on the stress suffered by train drivers concerning possible suicides.	0.4997198936310011
Persuading the mass media to treat the subject of 'suicide' with reserve and with greater caution, even when not presenting a distinct suicide model, may be of importance in general suicide prevention.	0.6537059341157814
For decades the results of elective lymph node dissection (ELND) are differently discussed, so that it is not definitely recommended at present the less so since the morbidity of this operation can't be neglected.	0.6374234068728887
Since the beginning of 1995 we practice a gamma-probe guided sentinel lymphonodectomy (SLNE) on patients with melanoma from a Breslow tumor thickness of 1 mm upward, after injecting a colloidal 99m-Tc labelled tin (II) - sulfid solution around the tumor or the scar, if the tumor has been excided before.	0.5610700584780051
By this method, that allows a selection of patients who according clinically to a stage I or II (UICC) but even histopathologically to a stage III and who are profiting of a removal of the regional lymph nodes, the sentinel node can be exactly localised, tissue-sparing removed at minimal complication rates and the completeness of the removal can be verified by measurements of the radioactivity.	0.6998164622691997
When finding metastases in the histopathological examination of the node a dissection of the whole region follows.	0.6017855195017938
During rehabilitation of patients suffering from a recent hip fracture, we evaluated the development of several aspects of their subjective well-being (n=87, age: 70 to 94).	0.6617462303817303
In most cases, a deterioration of subjective well-being due to the consequences of the hip fracture could be prevented; the well-being improved in most cases.	0.8090036601987899
When discharged, the subjective well-being of our patients was comparable to the well-being of similar-aged people living at home.	0.8740433016560629
Antidepressants are used in demented patients for treating depressive symptoms as well as other non-cognitive symptoms including agitation, aggression and irritability.	0.4743946195918596
As patients are usually elderly, a dose adjustment is mandatory for all classes of antidepressants.	0.5662163547467353
New antidepressants such as the SSRIs and the reversible MAO inhibitors should be the first-line agents in these patients, because their efficacy is not different from that of classic TCA, but they have advantages regarding frequency of adverse effects, ease of use and safety.	0.6590214938602954
Improvement in cognitive performance, however, may not be expected from the new antidepressants.	0.5919860580951115
For the treatment of agitation, aggression and irritabiltiy, antipychotics and benzodiazepines are in frequent use, although their adverse effects are particularly problematic in demented patiens.	0.46821799461324076
Good alternatives are the antidepressant trazodone and citalopram.	0.26180755949964857
All medications mentioned have been studied on small patient samples, so treatment recommendations must be given cautiously.	0.5669222672595368
The application of laser energy to joint capsular tissues resulted in the reduction of the joint capsule.	0.6420543026296202
Primary clinical results of combined laser-assisted capsular shrinkage (LACS) and multiple suture repair (Caspari) for arthroscopic stabilization procedure of anterior shoulder instability are presented.	0.6545205774572108
From July 1997 to October 1998, 18 patients (2 female, 16 male; mean age 27.9 years; range 16-42 years) with anterior instability and recurrent dislocations of the shoulder received a combined arthroscopic stabilization procedure.	0.827707756684896
The operative technique involved the use of transglenoid sutures to repair the labrum and shift the capsule (Caspari) and LACS.	0.5246712766832753
Laser energy was applied using a Ho: YAG laser (10 W, 1 J, 10 pulses/s, total energy: 1500-2000 J).	0.6025706550669704
The patients were followed for an average of 9 months (range 4-20 months).	0.9041590895383932
From June 1992 to Februrary 1996, arthroscopic suture stabilization without laser shrinkage was performed on 17 patients (2 female, 15 male; age 25.9 years/range 18-37 years).	0.6416016288839935
The average follow-up in this group was 4.5 years (range 2-5.5 years), and we found 41.2% (7/17) recurrent dislocations.	1.0069075554319176
After combined arthroscopic procedure of multiple suture repair (Caspari) and LACS, a significantly (chi-squared test, P = 0.05) lower recurrence rate was obtained.	0.6077918697907716
Only in one patient (5.6%, 1/18) did we find this failure.	0.8509728023126099
No complications occurred in either group.	0.2849061968425493
The combination of arthroscopic LACS and Caspari's technique of multiple suture repair in cases of posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability and recurrent dislocations is promising.	0.5615879672121914
Although, no long-term results are available, the method seems to be suitable for associating low recurrence rates with the advantages of arthroscopic surgery.	0.7807800602417756
Simple bone cysts are asymptomatic, benign lesions which are usually an incidental finding on a radiograph.	0.560082278319466
Etiology and treatment are controversially discussed.	0.5602746415017182
The weightbearing status of the calcaneus and possible pathologic fracturing lead many authors to recommend therapeutic measures after diagnosis has been made.	0.5271254726273316
We present a case report of an intact unicameral bone cyst of the calcaneus concomitant with tibial and talar fractures following crush trauma.	0.6640799856321953
Several types of treatment for simple bone cysts of the calcaneus have been suggested.	0.609726654197975
The question whether treatment is unconditionally necessary is controversially discussed.	0.4074408313168076
It is the author's opinion, that asymptomatic bone cysts of the calcaneus require no further treatment.	0.6902181992497701
Facial neuromyography is an objective electrophysiologic measurement used to assess prognosis for recovery from facial paralysis.	0.40884242000024235
In the present study variability over time of the amplitude ratio in healthy subjects was investigated.	0.7227415577659417
Twenty healthy subjects underwent four neuromyographic tests at intervals of one week.	0.31053112615658035
The study group consisted of 12 males and 8 females.	0.5384652822218251
Ages ranged from 23 to 36 years.	0.25082198970329517
The stimulation intensity required for supramaximal stimulation was 14.6 mA on average.	0.48921637117064104
The mean of the intra-individual side-to-side difference of the evoked compound action potential was 32.5%.	0.5408666982396776
Results of the four repeated tests ranged from no to 80% side-to-side differences in the same individual.	0.7079286912992945
The hypothesis of symmetrical evoked facial compound potentials was not supported by our data.	0.3922969789732117
As with previous investigators we found significant side-to-side differences in healthy subjects.	0.48935987523510344
Furthermore, we could also show for the first time that the amplitude ratio was not constant in every individual at repeated measurements.	0.716588296797357
We conclude that there is a physiological variability that must be taken into account in the interpretation of facial nerve neuromyography.	0.5871465840025916
To compare patient dose and image quality of electron-beam-CT vs. spiral-CT by means of phantom measurements.	0.5414468092460956
An EBCT scanner (C-150 XP) and a spiral-CT scanner (GE  HiSpeed Advantage) were used to scan three different phantoms.	0.7315593897325019
Administered dose, high contrast (HC) resolution, low contrast (LC) lesion detectability and the width of the radiation beams were measured.	0.5773304730979993
EBCT showed 25-35% lower HC resolution in comparison to spiral-CT. LC lesion detectability showed equivalent results for S/N vs. patient dose using 3 mm collimation with EBCT and spiral-CT, whereas spiral-CT was superior for 1,5 and 6 mm collimation.	0.6192677034016881
Dose measurements revealed a 2 fold higher patient dose using EBCT with 1,5 mm or 6 mm collimation compared to spiral-CT using equivalent scan parameters.	0.529639237679997
No differences were seen using 3 mm collimation.	0.473589801869685
Differences were due to insufficient beamside collimation of the EBCT.	0.353521292126218
The use of EBCT with 6 mm collimation should be avoided, because of impaired performance.	0.7209780162290679
Using 3 mm collimation, EBCT showed comparable performance like state of the art spiral-CT despite lower HC resolution.	0.5325666902187001
In an experimental study, the biomechanical qualities of the combined Kirschner wire osteosynthesis (KWO) in the unstable Colles' fracture were analyzed.	0.6176016685128058
This type of pin fixation is our preferred osteosynthesis in the treatment of unstable Colles' fracture because it allows immediate functional therapy.	0.5135644688723033
It represents a modification of Kapandji's dynamic KWO, compensating for the insufficient volar stability by means of the conventional static KWO.	0.4603530096284497
Clinical experience according to the anatomical and functional results, was very encouraging suggesting that a clinical concept based on the biomechanical principles of combined KWO and its single components should be constituted.	0.6901788519439874
Simulation of the unstable Colles' fracture was realized by dorsal wedge osteotomy of the distal end of the radius using cadaveric material.	0.5434319544139911
This fracture model was subsequently pinned using the different KWO types and tested by a standardized vector energy testing device regarding its stability in the four main loading directions.	0.4944537655738132
The combined KWO unifies the advantage of volar stability of the conventional KWO with the high dorsal stability of dynamic KWO.	0.5787329572689175
The main functional principle of dynamic KWO with regard to its axial stability consists in the repositioning of the dorsal bone fragmentation zone and hence the reconstitution of cortical load transmission.	0.4699787269420708
Besides its good stabilization, dynamic KWO also leads to optimal alignment of the distal metaphyseal fragment.	0.5530393098975932
Furthermore, the experiments yielded important information about technical aspects of the surgical procedure, which helps us to avoid anatomical and functional deficiencies.	0.7304828155413807
Based on these experimental findings, the surgical technique of combined KWO was standardized.	0.863297749006342
Purpose: It is difficult to measure the topography of the cornea with high resolution and visualize it on a map displaying refraction.	0.6346930681698452
This is demonstrated by the ongoing improvement and further development of different methods and by the fact that users of these techniques are not always satisfied.	0.7996848898772223
We present the case of a 2-year-old boy who was brought to hospital with extensive scalding of the face.	0.7435494494057503
The clinicians raised the suspicion of a physical maltreatment of the child.	0.4470509085694493
Because of the morphological findings the medico-legal expert came to the conclusion that maltreatment was proven.	0.5056966761393006
During the criminal proceedings at the appeal court contrary opinions on the morphological findings of the injury between the clinical expert and the medico-legal expert became obvious.	0.6023662566973804
Findings of the physical examination of the child and the experimental studies on immersion and pouring of water and the influence of clothing in case of wetting with hot water were presented which confirmed that the injury was caused by maltreatment.	0.5910558605079791
The opinion of the clinical expert which supported the case of the accused could be refuted.	0.646811937762177
During the final legal proceedings the opinions of the clinical expert had been sufficient for the court to justify an acquittal "in dubio pro reo".	0.5169360229567694
Anterior thoracoscopic interbody stabilization and fusion was performed in 163 patients.	0.5291139650722042
Lesions treated were located between T4 and L3, most frequently occuring at T12/L2.	0.4416761512766223
Operative time decreased dramatically as experience was gained with the procedure.	0.30546828144858346
2 patients early in the series successfully were converted to an open procedure.	0.3893197258318155
One positioning related pressure harm on the thoracodorsal nerve and one irritation of the L1 root at the entrance site were both transitory.	0.346220502639226
Postoperative control by X-ray and CTscan showed correct positioning of the bone graft, as well as the fixation device in all patients.	0.7157770595376426
Our experience with this minimally invasive procedure demonstrated the feasibility of the method.	0.6446832864020958
Major advantages compared to the open procedure are reduced morbidity of the approach, postoperative pain reduction, early recovery of function and shortened hospital stay.	0.6648334657844157
In order to restore function and esthetics in mandibular hypoplasia, transplantation of osteochondral grafts and the distraction osteogenesis technique are used alternatively.	0.4709959394318428
In a retrospective study the indication, growth and complication rate of osteochondral graft and distraction osteogenesis cases in mandibular hypoplasia were compared.	0.5937505629923183
In total, 12 patients (4-14 years old; 7 female, 5 male) with different grades of mandibular hypoplasia received osteochondral grafts (7 costochondral, 5 iliac crest; observation period 4-9 years).	0.752468966460238
In 5 patients (10-12 years old; 1 female, 4 male), distraction osteogenesis was performed (observation period 10 months to 3 1/2 years).	0.6887897933016749
In the results, according to the literature, the range of growth after osteochondral grafting varied considerably, approximate normal growth was noticed in only two cases.	0.549450091085225
On the other hand, all patients treated by distraction osteogenesis showed a stable increase of bone length as expected.	0.6685349014315002
After osteochondral grafts, adequate growth is to be expected in the minority of cases and it does not seem predictable in individual cases.	0.7047923253721632
Therefore, the indication for osteochondral grafts should be restricted to severe hypoplasia, where the local amount of bone does not allow the use of a distraction device, and to cases where support of the mandibula at the skull base is necessary.	0.7447308556487225
In all other cases of mandibular hypoplasia in children, distraction osteogenesis should be discussed as the primary option, even if in the long term a second surgical procedure should be necesssary.	0.7063758960764484
To evaluate the predictive value of MRI in the early postoperative course after cruciate ligament replacement, a prospective study was performed.	0.9393279251529436
Twenty patients with reconstructed anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament were examined clinically and with contrast-enhanced MRI 2, 12, 24 weeks, 1 and 2 years postoperatively.	0.7255673106660424
The clinical examinations were evaluated according to the scores by Lysholm, OAK and IKDC.	0.3966861011244985
The MRI scans (SP 63, 1.5 Tesla) were evaluated regarding the quality and signal intensity of the reconstructed ligament.	0.8583242691776886
During the first postoperative year a significant increase in signal intensity and inhomogeneity of the neoligament in MRI was observed in 16 patients with an average value for signal/noise of 1.1 2 weeks postoperatively up to 6.9 1 year postoperatively.	0.8386337247693617
In 12 patients the reconstructed ligament could not be evaluated in the 1-year postoperative MRI, whereas none of these patients was suspected clinically of having instability.	0.8635445100118522
In the 2-year postoperative MRI, the signal intensity of the neoligament was found to be decreasing again with improvement in judgement.	0.7027743935935585
Miniplate osteosynthesis is a standard method for the surgical treatment of mandible fractures today.	0.7056966891054601
Apart from easy handling, in the majority of cases it also ensures adequate fracture stability.	0.6525006137767887
The treatment of fractures of very atrophic mandibles as well as mandibular defects and comminuted fractures with miniplates and rigid plates is often difficult or only possible to an inadequate extent.	0.5424853222586902
Titanium mesh has proved successful for the treatment of such fractures.	0.5097849516898693
Compared with conventional miniplates this mesh is outstanding for its considerably higher stability due to its given geometry.	0.4249771516790516
The titanium mesh can be adapted and screwed individually in any situation, in contrast to miniplates and rigid plates.	0.5083854248192645
As a result, complications such as fracture gap infections and pseudoarthrosis can be avoided to a great extent.	0.6076831208939362
Non-invasive methods to identify absent or persistent myocardial viability have gained increasing importance in the therapeutic management and risk stratification of patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.	0.6899307802911252
Myocardial scintigraphy using thallium-201 and positron emission tomography with metabolic imaging of myocardial glucose metabolism, using fluorine-18 fluoro-deoxyglucose, are today the most widely used nuclear methods for the assessment of myocardial viability.	0.5463600956751153
Besides the prediction of reversible regional and global myocardial dysfunction following coronary revascularization, both methods have demonstrated the ability to identify patient subgroups who will benefit most with regard to cardiac prognosis and survival and those patients in whom coronary revascularization has a limited effect with regard to survival and cardiac events.	0.576300998208531
This short review summarizes the clinical impact of both imaging modalities on todays diagnostic approach in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction.	0.4158630367762307
An elderly woman was found dead in her farm house lying in a pool of blood and was partially unclothed.	0.43109068221015545
Blood was also discovered in several rooms on the first floor.	0.47422028228801444
The investigation at the scene led to the conclusion of a sexual murder.	0.7242264928950126
The autopsy however revealed the source of the hemorrhage to be a renal artery aneurysm which had ruptured in the adjacent renal pelvis.	0.6149004514279227
The woman has obviously been surprised by the sudden bleeding which produced the impressive pattern of blood stains on the floor and finally a fatal hemorrhage.	0.36506462965322856
A similar case of a ruptured renal artery aneurysm and bleeding to death via the urinary tract has not yet been described.	0.6227964274999005
In the ankle (talocrural) joint, the lower end of the tibia and fibula embrace the trochlea tali.	0.7243826458164265
Thus, an approximately uniaxial joint is formed which permits dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot against the leg.	0.5491078681354922
Due to the geometry of the trochlea tali, conjunct lateral rotation of the fibula against the tibia occurs at the tibiofibular articulations synchronously with active dorsiflexion at the ankle joint.	0.49457762227119645
Movements at the talocrural joints are mainly limited by the opposing muscles as well as by strong collateral ligaments.	0.4757455217716674
Talus and calcaneus form a functional unit connected by posterior and anterior articulations.	0.39758119488368837
The posterior articulation is the subtalar (talocalcaneal) joint; in the anterior articulation, talar facets of the calcaneus together with the posterior surface of the navicular and the superior fibrocartilaginous surface of the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament form a concavity for the talar head.	0.575267304713579
Thus, the talocalcaneonavicular joint is a compound and - like the subtalar joint - a multiaxial articulation.	0.7413843610561534
On the weight-bearing foot, the distal tarsus and metatarsus are pronated and supinated against the talus in order to maintain plantigrade contact.	0.48674071934629304
When the foot is off the ground, these movements are modified to eversion and inversion, also involving the calcaneocuboid joint.	0.5203508580161077
In addition, movements between the calcaneus and cuboid also occur during pronative or supinative changes between the fore- and hindfoot.	0.5162453059960522
Limitation of movements is due to leg muscles as well as strong ligaments.	0.3794398078831864
Finally, the cuneonavicular, cuboideonavicular, intercuneiform and cuneocuboid joints permit some additional alterations of the loaded foot in contact with the ground.	0.44991567767491725
A case of primary splenic angiosarcoma with involvement of two accessory spleens is presented.	0.4484554074713799
The tumor cells are immunoreactive for endothelial markers (CD 31, CD 34, factor VIII associated antigen) and express also histiocytic antigens (CD 68, lysozyme, Cathepsin D, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin) as well as CD 8.	0.5887544972833264
This marker profile suggests that the presented angiosarcoma originates from sinus cells with  histiocytic and endothelial differentiation and may be regarded as the malignant variant of littoral cells angioma.	0.5413413759401707
Despite major advances in knowledge and development of efficient techniques for pain control, many patients on surgical wards suffer from modest to severe pain following surgery or trauma.	0.5242227596866408
Therefore, in the University Hospital of Kiel, Germany, an anaesthesiology-based acute pain service (APS) was started in 1985 to improve this situation.	0.7165469562455895
The anaesthesiologist in training who manages the recovery unit serves as an APS for surgical wards and is supervised by a consultant.	0.4686380406813476
The anaesthesists on call are responsible after regular working hours.	0.23764687053236802
The activities of the APS are as follows: 1.	0.433413053415788
Induction of sufficient postoperative analgesia in the recovery unit for all surgical patients.	0.5649633618043403
Clinical rounds on all patients receiving epidural analgesia (EA), other forms of regional analgesia, or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) every morning and throughout the day if necessary.	0.5860983244316685
Additional consultations for postoperative pain management for other patients on request.	0.5071584575503602
Assessment and documentation of the clinical status of the patient, quality of analgesia, and side effects.	0.8496889678965702
Writing orders for further treatment.	0.315750564935702
Continuing consultations and informal education for ward nurses, physiotherapists, and surgical staff; formal medical training for ward nurses in postoperative pain management.	0.5659107209219677
From 1985 to 1992, 1947 patients on normal wards were treated (EA: 1736, PCA: 183).	0.38882838465491104
Epidural analgesia was performed using a standard protocol with bupivacaine 0.175% - 0.25% infused continuously with top-ups if needed (mean 240 mg/day, range 75 - 600 mg; median duration 7 days, range 1 - 53, Table 1).	0.7211383034668932
Demand for further treatment was proved by day-to-day withdrawal.	0.5398449349231984
Since the introduction of an APS, complications of EA such as hypotension (1985/1986: 5.1%; 1987/1992: 0.5%, Table 3) and insufficient analgesia due to dislocation or other technical complications could be reduced significantly (Table 3).	0.6663048868412131
Dermal infections were seen in 2.6% of patients, with a significantly higher incidence in patients with arteriosclerotic diseases (4.1%).	0.9210708670990708
Epidural opioids were used in only 46 selected cases on surgical wards.	0.48451197140916624
Nevertheless, 2 cases of marked respiratory depression occurred.	0.6560768109128375
The overall risk of complications during postoperative EA could be reduced from 1 : 11 cases in the first 2 years to 1 : 20 in the last 6 years since introducing the APS.	0.6720252661218795
For other regional procedures (e.g., interpleural analgesia) no complications were recorded.	0.4723410891838846
PCA was performed using a standard protocol with tramadol or piritramide without background infusion (Table 6).	0.5556224900293774
The loading dose was titrated in the recovery unit.	0.4649455437517175
The median duration of PCA was 4 days (range 1 - 23); the median dose of piritramide was 45 mg/day (range 3 - 226 mg).	0.7308526075898195
Two cases of somnolence and respiratory depression occurred.	0.45979130478918634
In this period there were 8 potential life-threatening complications due to postoperative pain therapy; 4 occurred during standard surgical pain management (3 cases of severe respiratory depression after i.m.	0.7802374560768794
piritramide (unsuccessfull resuscitation), tramadol, and buprenorphine; 1 small child with multiorgan failure after paracetamol intoxication).	0.45329169786534357
In those cases the APS was not involved.	0.46148650278502895
There are insufficient data for comparison of the incidence of complications following standard management of postoperative pain relief without an APS, i.e., i.m.	0.6316316116150036
injections of opioids on request, but severe and sometimes lethal complications have been reported.	0.5906580559523313
Since the majority of patients used EA or PCA for several days, it is again emphasised that these techniques should not be restricted to high-dependency areas such as intensive care or recovery units.	0.5749635299674496
The introduction of an APS is an adequate approach to more efficient and safer pain management on surgical wards.	0.4586378743430991
This requires standard protocols (Table 7), standardised monitoring and trained ward nurses.	0.48171403179638833
Lambdoid synostosis can manifest unilaterally, bilaterally or in combination with other craniosynostoses.	0.38420838131160534
Using the concept of fronto-orbital advancement we developed occipital advancement in order to correct unilateral or bilateral lambdoid synostosis.	0.44157317157880355
The process involves striped transversal osteotomy, removal, remodelling and advancement of the occipital region.	0.41882187399574444
It allows precise, reproducible and predictable positioning of the segments.	0.45521303767815924
Artificial sutures are created as a result of the osteotomy.	0.49127616288761794
The remodelling leads to a well-proportioned skull shape and advancement to an increase in the intracranial volume.	0.5578063772077764
This article presents the operative method and the results of 14 patients.	0.7050879527026576
Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy is a rare neoplasm of neural crest origin.	0.5732333171828967
It almost always occurs in children younger than one year of age with a predilection for the anterior maxillary ridge.	0.5113452018336352
Although it usually follows a benign course, local destruction as well as metastasis and death may result from the tumor.	0.6536496042751061
Melanotic neuroectodermal tumor is most commonly treated by surgery.	0.4345383715686523
10-15% of the lesions recur.	0.8884689580663192
We report the case of a 2-month-old infant suffering from melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy of the premaxilla who was successfully treated with a combination of various chemotherapeutic agents in order to spare the child a mutilating operation or the late effects of radiation.	0.5792170685679466
Computer-assisted techniques were introduced in spine surgery in the 1990s to improve accuracy and safety of operative procedures.	0.6359852286796368
Several reports on clinical results of computer-aided screw insertion in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine as well as the sacro-iliac joints are available.	0.651484193571527
They show a significant decrease of screw malplacement rates as compared to conventional insertion techniques.	0.6270833014626738
Over the past years, antioxidants, and particularly vitamin E, have received considerable attention in the treatment of human diseases.	0.710967943440693
In rheumatology, interest has been given to the treatment and prevention of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.	0.7732102188160173
However, the concept of using antioxidant nutrients as potential remedies is not new.	0.5153853977993568
As early as the sixties, first case reports have described beneficial effects of vitamin E in the therapy of osteoarthritis.	0.580049971014699
Nonetheless, most of the following studies were not conducted properly, thus, not allowing valid inferences about the efficacy of vitamin E. Newer studies with sound methodology have shown a beneficial effect in rheumatic diseases, mainly in the reduction of pain.	0.7545100676261384
This paper reviews current and past studies about vitamin E in the treatment of rheumatic diseases.	0.5310887797689997
Patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (i.v.-PCA) represents the gold standard in the management of acute postoperative pain.	0.638292428221314
However, in many countries i.v.-PCA is rarely used.	0.7960936727359647
Recent clinical studies demonstrated that intranasal fentanyl titration provides a rapid and safe form and pain management.	0.4795671704315837
In the present study we investigated patients' acceptance and assessment of patient-controlled intranasal analgesia (PCINA) and compared it to intravenous PCA and the customarily prescribed pain therapy.	0.6503752708056263
Unreamed nailing with solid tibial nails is an accepted method of treatment for open tibial shaft fractures up to grade III and of closed tibial fractures with severe soft tissue damage.	0.5684125218640134
However, fatigue failure of the distal locking bolts is a frequent complication.	0.8883828360452561
We report a mechanical study investigating the fatigue limit of six different types of locking bolts used in solid tibial nails (Biorigid Tibial nail/aap, UTN/ace, STN/Howmedica, TLN/Howmedica, R & T Tibial nail/Smith & Nephew, AO/ASIF UTN/Synthes).	0.421485323434432
Our results prove a direct correlation between the bolt's diameter and mechanical properties.	0.4399435626239875
Further more we found that bolts with a continuing thread were weaker than bolts of the same diameter with only a short thread and an increased diameter at the nail's aperture.	0.5297127076488184
Our results suggest that mobilization with half of the average body weight (350N) allows osseous consolidation without fatigue failure of any of the tested locking bolts.	0.5131124214198329
Some of the tested locking bolts may even withstand full weight-bearing in a physiological walking cycle, but will not withstand the stress of a running cycle.	0.5243733249458559
Voiding dysfunctions secondary to failure of adequate relaxation of the striated urinary sphincter or the smooth bladder neck should be considered in children with urinary day time incontinence and/or enuresis and recurrent urinary tract infections.	0.5335516160957998
The urodynamic findings resemble to those obtained in neuropathic bladders, but only a minority of the children suffer from neurologic disorders or anatomical obstruction.	0.6069770425289847
In the majority of cases a developmental delay of the central nervous system responsible for urinary control is assumed.	0.5323968081006434
Behavioural disturbances play another important etiological role.	0.19842757464814378
Therapy is based on behavioural modification.	0.3581568559145712
We report on two patients with granulomatous rosacea and another patient with granulomatous perioral dermatitis who responded well to dapsone.	0.5723831315076489
Dapsone has a pharmacological double function as both an antibiotic and an antiphlogistic drug.	0.34198072645880107
Before the introduction of isotretinoin, dapsone had its place in the treatment of severe acne.	0.5141098812396598
To date, its use in granulomatous rosacea has not been described.	0.7033205719004084
When hematologic parameters are monitored, dapsone is considered a safe and cost-effective drug, especially in countries where isotretinoin is not readily available.	0.664983383176883
However, the definite value of dapsone in granulomatous rosacea should be established by a controlled study.	0.5921633755091005
Anaesthesia both for adenotomy (AT) and for tonsillectomy (TE) frequently presents a challenge.	0.6191091286542222
On one hand, children scheduled for adenotomy often have upper airway infections and are thus at risk of laryngo- and bronchospasm; on the other hand the ENT surgeon and the anaesthetist have to share the "workspace" in the patient's mouth.	0.7747947593024305
Since the succinyl choline debate in the early 1990s, the question of the best muscle relaxant has gone hand in hand with that of the most appropriate means of securing the airway.	0.7022237655377609
The concept of the laryngeal mask as airway was initially greeted with scepticism.	0.46229125591598946
Following several years' use of the mask for this purpose in AT and TE in young children, we report our experience and summarise the literature on this topic.	0.7288844935777189
The laryngeal mask represents a safe alternative to intubation, provided there is close cooperation with the ENT surgeon.	0.6427127399740253
Topical corticosteroids (CS) are frequently used to treat of allergic contact dermatitis, so that their own potential for sensitization is rarely detected.	0.674115220814066
However, increasing numbers of hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids have been reported during the last 10 years, and allergic skin reactions to over 50 particular compounds have been observed.	0.7115871554682842
CS must now be regarded as a rather frequent contact allergen, the prevalence being twice as high in women as in men.	0.5994777656275265
Contact allergy to CS is clinically characterized by a chronic and persistent, corticosteroid-resistant dermatitis.	0.48266548100381934
In general, hypersensitivity to CS is a type I and/or type IV mediated allergic reaction.	0.5357975439223933
Cross-sensitivity between individual corticosteroid preparations has been described owing to their closely related chemical structures (e.g.	0.39317773574576725
hydrocortisone and tixocortol pivalate).	0.1229063027937644
Contact allergy to CS can be confirmed by patch-tests, intradermal injection tests or application tests; because of the delayed appearance of positive skin reactions a prolonged evaluation period of up to 120 h is recommended.	0.4785638816859658
For routine screening the use of the patient's own material and of tixocortol pivalate and budesonide as test marker substances seems appropriate.	0.5845040369907446
The development of further marker substances is a target for ongoing research.	0.3949457024475937
The alliance concepts are defined as being the description of the dynamic interaction of all cognitive and emotional factors which promote the analytic process.	0.561883385234363
The historical significance and the development of the three predominant alliance concepts, these being the implicit "standard alliance" of Freud, Zetzel's therapeutic alliance and Greenson's working alliance, are to be described.	0.6425416523027097
All alliance concepts refer to a general, essentially reality-oriented relationship anchored in the personal and the human domain, which forms the background for the therapeutic process and the basis for the analytic interpretation work.	0.6559873482863576
Nonetheless, the dynamic force of the alliances is substantiated by factors of the transference.	0.6350070317624866
The alliances are therefore not faced with the transference, but rather with the resistance.	0.6282326493852315
We report on a 15-months-old girl with a history of recurrent phlegmones of the lower eyelid, dacryocystitides, conjunctivities and mucositis together with growth-retardation, chronic obstipation and anal prolaps.	0.5861219541153746
During a period of 19 days absolute neutropenia was observed.	0.3047500258432699
Retrospectively, neutrophil counts were between 0-500/µl from birth on.	0.3439482422400468
Bone marrow biopsy revealed an arrest of maturation of granulopoiesis at the stage of promyelocytes.	0.45171751983960035
Continuous therapy with 10  µg/kg/d of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) induced 12-day oscillations of blood neutrophil counts.	0.5994122225022456
There were no oscillations of counts of other blood cell lines.	0.5495028030131152
Growth retardation and prolaps of anus normalized, and few intercurrent bacterial infections, pneumonia and impetigo contagiosa occurred.	0.4490089444618194
A mutation in the G-CSF-receptor gene was not found in this patient.	0.6852334970810671
After 2 years of therapy, a reduction of rhG-CSF dose (application every 2 days) lead to a severe neutropenia.	0.6714509808671202
We report a 31-year-old renal transplant patient treated with cyclosporin A who developed an unusual sebaceous gland hyperplasia accompanied by a disseminated follicular spiny hyperkeratosis.	0.570708157381347
Those alterations were most evident on his face and limbs.	0.3656489410050835
In some locations hairy hyperkeratosis with authentic hair neogenesis was found.	0.21079980384310157
The histology of these alterations showed a marked hyperkeratosis of the hair follicles with formation of hair-like spikes either alone or in connection with hairs.	0.6285133943537928
The presence of true hairs distinguishes our case from the morphologically similar disseminated spiked hyperkeratosis and other spiny keratinization disorders.	0.32138780569728254
Scanning electron microscopy helped to demonstrate the hair-like structure of these keratoses.	0.5162769097403633
Some of the sebaceous glands showed cystic widening of their lumina, which were filled with abundant amorphous eosinophilic material, a finding similar to earlier observations.	0.6170326784160043
Our case demonstrates that these skin alterations should be classified as side effects of cyclosporin A and that they are apparently dose-dependent.	0.5601686568294258
Background: Since increased intraoperative iris irritation can lead to increased postoperative inflammation, we are interested in postoperative reactions to several varied surgical procedures.	0.5982691070291553
We performed pupil stretching, iridotomy with iris suture, and partial sphincterectomy.	0.5008428609727874
Reports of accidental alkaloid-intoxications with plants of the nightshade family, in  particular Datura-species are well known in pediatric care.	0.4900885663431089
The intentional abuse as a hallucinogenic drug in adolescents became more frequent in recent years.	0.4056666861977654
Two patients, a 14- resp.	0.576992870961392
16-year old boy were admitted to the intensive care units of our hospitals  because of a severe central anticholinergic syndrome after ingestion of tea from Angel's Trumpet blossoms for experimental reasons.	0.6670526891775529
Patient's history in the first somnolent patient was not available at the time of admission, a routine immunological drug screening of the patient's urine had been negative.	0.8012557983323596
In the present case of a granular cell tumor an abdomino-thoracal resection of the esophagus was performed in a 41-year-old patient after preoperative diagnosis had suggested esophageal cancer.	0.7645813632797142
Granular cell tumors (Abrikossoff's tumor) of the esophagus are rather rare tumors of neuroectodermal benign histogenesis.	0.6210273518313205
Diagnosis can be obtained by endoscopic and histological study and immunohistochemical forceps biopsy.	0.5391475107725271
Because of the peculiar histological feature of the tumor, it can be mistaken for an squamous cell carcinoma.	0.7202653184539398
In the guidelines for determination of the blood alcohol level for forensic purposes, a correction factor of 1.2 has been established for the conversion of serum alcohol into blood alcohol based on the relationship of the water content between serum and whole blood.	0.796472718479582
The reliability of the determination of the blood alcohol level is dependent on the possible minimum and maximum values of this correction factor.	0.6031934958905859
In a comprehensive multicenter study consisting of 833 samples, which can be considered representative of persons involved in offences under the drinking and driving act, an average quotient of 1.16 was found with minimum and maximum values of 1.08 and 1.21 respectively.	0.6760636843175989
In 96% of the cases the quotient was between 1.13 and 1.19 and the deviation of the quotient from the average value was less than 3%.	0.7583987210109876
From these results it can be assumed that the determination of blood alcohol is obviously more reliable than previously presumed.	0.6097237688612365
In Germany, if the dermatologist has definite proof that a patient's skin disorder is severe or chronic, work-related and requiring a change in occupation, then he or she must issue a Berufskrankheitenanzeige (loosely translated as occupational disease notification).	0.5421905169938751
The patient's consent is not required for this mandatory form, which has to be submitted even if the patient is opposed.	0.8702889679070515
On the other hand, if there is only a possible connection between the occupation and the skin disorder, or if the skin disease is neither severe nor chronic nor threatening pursuit of the occupation, then the dermatologist needs only write a Hautarztbericht (dermatologist's report).	0.5927368666737436
The patient's permission is required for this less formal document.	0.6457370471896527
Bone marrow involvement is often observed in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors.	0.5200767233957839
Sensitive immunological and molecular biological methods allow the detection of isolated transformed cells in bone marrow samples.	0.5203251903693752
Like normal hematopoietic cells, tumor cells interact with bone marrow stroma through adhesion molecules.	0.4686073908455213
Since adhesion mulecules play an essential role in the invasion and proliferation of malignant cells, new therapeutic approaches involving the inhibition of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are conceivable.	0.5647881502885485
With the development of powerful computer systems, computer-assisted medical diagnosis and therapy have become common over the last 10 years.	0.6199743575663695
Even in the surgical field, computer- and robotic-assisted techniques are becoming practical but are not yet used on a daily basis.	0.6945599205597357
In the orthopaedic field, computer and robotic assistance is used in planning and performing demanding three-dimensional osteotomies, setting pedicle screws in the spine and milling the femoral medullary canal in total hip replacement.	0.5546488620246691
This article introduces a computer- and robotic-assisted system for performing arthroplasty in total knee replacement procedures.	0.5321116071963239
The hand is very exposed to injuries in the daily man's work.	0.5732269285988281
The multiple functions of the hand are based on vitality, sensibility, motor function and stability.	0.555249987884934
In severe hand injuries the functional results of the repair are often very poor.	0.6846839891936531
In a complex injury of the hand we are faced with the damage of the soft tissue and bone and the loss of vitality and function of the hand.	0.8039747534124339
The cause of hand injuries are mainly a crush trauma or the rotating saw.	0.464691837366799
Basically, we recommend an extended primary repair.	0.7419229900421634
After the radical debridement we have to reconstruct the damaged structures.	0.5009677185610487
We start doing the osteosynthesis and stabilization of the joints.	0.5042223696122092
Thereafter, suturing of extensor and flexor tendons.	0.25911609920870915
Then, we do the microsurgical reconstructions of vessels and nerves.	0.6032234471450038
In case tendons and bones are exposed we have to cover the defect with a pedicled or a free flap.	0.5736387285549118
In a long ischemic time we have to change our concept and do the reconstruction of the vessels first.	0.6669170200508816
Our results in vitality and sensibility are listed.	0.2764958472286424
In the result of a complex hand injury each single functional restoration is very important.	0.5794386753527853
Therefore, it is necessary that severe hand injuries are treated at well established centres for hand surgery.	0.6675151777702991
A 34-year-old women had a hen's egg-sized supernumerary mammary gland with no nipple or areola in the left anterior axillary line for the last 8 years.	0.486114267443527
The main complaint about the axillary "lump" was that it was aesthetically displeasing, and it was excised.	0.6486176069851619
The importance of an axillary breast lies in the possibility that pathologic changes could develop in its substance and that clinically it could be confused with a lipoma.	0.5159267644756443
Early diagnosis and correct excision are usually recommended.	0.42961400486068413
Paclitaxel and docetaxel are potent drugs that are effective in the treatment of malignant tumors.	0.49691832066144764
The cytotoxic action of these drugs is not fully understood, but it appears to be mediated mainly through mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis.	0.666841986286146
Because no information is available on the antiangiogenesis action of docetaxel, the investigations were performed to determine whether inhibition of neoangiogenesis plays a role in docetaxel's antitumor efficacy.	0.6793479124515971
Four different mouse tumors, two squamous cell carcinomas (SCC-IV; SCC-VII) and two adenocarcinomas (MCA-4; MCA-29) were assayed for angiogenic activity using the in vivo i.c.	0.6103482562285685
Tumor cells (5 x 105) were injected i.c.	0.7628021049601695
into the skin flap over the abdominal wall, and the number of new blood vessels at the tumor cell injection site was determined 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days later.	0.825821786766264
The mice were treated with docetaxel (Taxotere - 31.3 mg/kg i.v.)	0.600688658050342
1 or 4 days after tumor cell injection.	0.5165609970103677
The number of new blood vessels increased with time.	0.37198961853067664
Docetaxel reduced the number of newly formed blood vessels in MCAs, but not in SCCs.	0.7686387939895617
The reduction was associated with slower tumor growth.	0.3315562079298012
In a separate set of experiments we observed that docetaxel's inhibitory effect on the two MCAs was histologically associated with massive tumor cell destruction by means of both apoptosis and necrosis.	0.5020987833533295
This was not observed for the two SCCs.	0.7469663916181126
Since no reduction in blood vessels occurred in tumors unresponsive to docetaxel, the inhibition of neoangiogenesis in docetaxel-responsive tumors was likely the result of a decrease in angiogenic stimuli due to docetaxel's destruction of tumor cells.	0.5619249664528168

A measurement system was developed that permits objective comparisons of the sound conduction of middle ear implants.	0.4369704577552003
The implants are fitted into a mechanical middle ear model which approximates the impedances of the eardrum and the inner ear.	0.41692638029497303
A defined signal within the frequency range of 0-5 kHz is provided by a miniaturized loudspeaker at the input to the model and is  measured by a probe microphone.	0.5662026989377967
Displacement of an artificial stapes footplate at the output of the model is measured by a fiberoptic probe with a sensitivity of 5 nm.	0.5209138393128323
The transmission function is calculated as the quotient of the output and the input signal.	0.45785434369431766

In acute myocardial infarction intracoronary stenting is superior to PTCA regarding interventional success and occurrence of cardiac events.	0.35911475004971505
It is, however, uncertain whether myocardial function also improves with stenting.	0.32787165736165946
We, therefore, assessed angiographic parameters of myocardial function in patients with acute myocardial infarction who were treated with primary PTCA and received additional stenting in case of an unsatisfactory angiographic result (provisional stenting).	0.6615451622732544
In order to perform accurate low-flow anaesthesia ventilation, it is desirable to avoid the influence of fresh gas flow (FGF) and inspiration duration (ID) on the resulting minute volume (MV).	0.7039696514805782
The Sulla 808V anaesthesia ventilator (Draeger, Luebeck, Germany) is originally not equipped with a fresh-gas decoupling (FGD) device.	0.4875660741203449
Therefore, changes of FGF and ID settings applied during controlled ventilation may lead to alterations of the resulting MV.	0.5337474205042135
Recently, a low-cost FGD device (Carbamed, Bern-Liebefeld, Switzerland) has been developed, which can be inserted into the circle system.	0.6509400054625636
We investigated the effect of this device on MV in the Sulla 808V anaesthesia apparatus.	0.503706412573221

DRGs are finding ever broader implementation internationally.	0.17341001862646999
Targets for using DRGs are hospital financing and budgeting, cost accounting and quality assurance.	0.4123413419340526
The present survey covering 18 countries shows that so far DRGs are most frequently used for budgeting purposes.	0.5085860308345592
In addition to DRG-based reimbursement, further quality assurance is necessary, but this is only being implemented with hesitation.	0.6765933882116762

Sinde the introduction of the bladder drainage technique, the number of pancreas transplants performed has now reached 1000/year worldwide.	0.538850247078252
Most of these transplants have been performed in the United States.	0.7058266892044421
In contrast, the number of pancreas transplants performed in the Eurotransplant community has remained at a low level for several years.	0.5372575408992656
The results of a consecutive series of 20 simultaneous pancreas/kidney grafts (SPK) performed between June 1994 and October 1995 demonstrate that high graft function rates of 83.5 % for pancreas and kidney grafts can be achieved.	0.6153857262735708
Therefore SPK can be recommended as a standard procedure for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease in Germany, too.	0.6773459710855432
Intubation and Positive End Expiratory Pressure Ventilation (PEEP) is a well established therapeutic strategy for impaired lung function, particularly following blunt chest trauma.	0.6636412594882921
Complications of this regime are however also well known and pose the question why non-invasive forms of respiratory assistance such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) have only gained minor popularity.	0.5527838984228608
In a prospective study, 30 patients who had suffered blunt chest trauma were treated with CPAP administered by mask.	0.7575718214399138
The regime consisted of continuous administration of CPAP by a face-mask, with gradually increasing periods of spontaneous breathing.	0.46859439610522907
Initially a FiO2 of 0.33 (range 0,28-0,38) proved necessary.	0.7219538057942789
The initial CPAP level was 7 mbar (range 5-8) with an (Assisted Spontaneous Breathing) ASB of 15 mbar (range 13-18).	0.7535454846026366
FiO2 and CPAP/ASB levels were subsequently gradually reduced until no longer necessary.	0.28345877538187864
In all patients intubation and ventilation was avoided by this regimen.	0.5899071369949077
The treatment was well accepted by all patients and common ventilation associated complications such as pneumonia did not occur.	0.560404481237234
In comparison with the former standard method of treatment the average ICU stay was dramatically reduced, principally due to not having to gradually wean patients from ventilation and sedation.	0.5331122302668457
Other positive benefits include normal communication and feeding with active early mobilisation leading to faster recovery, both physical and psychological.	0.4641974660044907
We conclude that non-invasive respiratory techniques should be used more frequently and recommend further studies are undertaken to define the indications.	0.6456111451848334
Abstract:  Clinical findings and the correct assessment of the morphology and degree of stenosis is a decidant point in the conservative and operative therapy of carotid stenosis.	0.7148867675326871

Current methods for articular cartilage repair are unpredictable with respect to clinical success.	0.4222369392307364
In the present study, we investigated the ability of cells from articular cartilage, perichondrium, and costochondral resting zone to form new cartilage when loaded onto biodegradable scaffolds and implanted into calf muscle pouches of nu/nu mice.	0.5763427604337344
Prior in vitro studies showed that platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), but not transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor, or bone morphogenetic protein-2 promoted proliferation and extracellular matrix sulfation of resting zone chondrocytes without causing the cells to exhibit a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype.	0.6062667236307929
TGF-1 has also been shown to stimulate chondrogenesis by multipotent chondroprogenitor cells like those in the perichondrium.	0.5122305614803174
In addition, PDGF-BB has been shown to modulate chondrogensis by resting zone cells implanted in poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffolds.	0.49680944762253776
In the present study we examined whether the cartilage formation is dependent on state of chondrocyte maturation and whether the pretreatment of chondrocytes with growth factors has an influence on the cartilage formation.	0.6675896538127785
Scaffolds were manufactured from 80 % PLG with a 75:25 lactide:glycolide ratio and 20 % modified PLG with a 50:50 lactide:glycolide ratio (PLG-H scaffolds).	0.5218591009584049
For each experimental group, four nude mice received two identical implants, one in each calf muscle resulting in an N = 8 implants: PLG-H scaffolds alone; PLG-H scaffolds with cells derived from either the femoral articular cartilage, costochondral periochondrium, or costochondral resting zone cartilage of 125 g male Sprague-Dawley rats; PLG-H scaffolds with either articular chondrocytes or resting zone chondrocytes that were pretreated with 37,5 ng/ml rhPDGF-BB for 4 h or 24 h before implantation, or with perichondrial cells treated with PDGF-BB plus 0,22 ng/ml rhTGF-1 for 4 h and 24 h. At 4 or 8 weeks after implantation, samples were harvested and analyzed histomorphometrically for new cartilage formed, area of residual implant and area of fibrous connective tissue.	0.5272111506897423
Only resting zone cells showed the ability to form new cartilage at a heterotopic site in this study.	0.5357676519746577
There was no neocartilage found in nude mice with implants loaded with either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells.	0.39080524716895515
Pretreatment of resting zone chondrocytes for 4 h prior to implantation significantly increased the amount of newly formed cartilage after 8 weeks and suppressed chondrocyte hypertrophy.	0.585659283205814
The amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells decreased with time, whereas the amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing resting zone chondrocytes pretreated with PDGF-BB was increased.	0.44994180517080323
The results showed that resting zone cells can be successfully incorporated into biodegradable porous PLG scaffolds and can induce new cartilage formation in a non-weight-bearing site.	0.5677619878748437
Articular chondrocytes as well as perichondrial cells did not have the capacity for neochondrogenesis when implanted heterotopically in this model.	0.46488758308914546
Bone tumors represent a group of tumors of various dignity.	0.5271681091930875
In spite of this single tumor entities may display strong morphological resemblance to each other which can in turn result in profound difficulties in differential diagnosis.	0.40313145882045043
The biological behaviour of a tumor is mainly determined by its rate of proliferation.	0.6174354845791312
In this study the rate of proliferation of 64 bone tumors (30 high-grade central osteosarcomas, 6 low-grade osteosarcomas, 8 giant cell tumors, 8 aneurysmatic bone cysts, 5 osteoidosteomas/osteoblastomas, 7 fibrous dysplasias and 5 cases of a myositis ossificans) were analysed.	0.8497607142669132
Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections using the MIB-1 monoclonal antibody.	0.5449693069394602
MIB-1 recognizes the proliferation-associated Ki-67 protein which is expressed during the active phases of the cell cycle but cannot be detected in senescent cells.	0.5728998450301706
Among high-grade central osteosarcomas a significantly higher rate of proliferation (average value 30 %) was found in comparison with low-grade osteosarcomas and other benign intraosseous bone tumors.	0.8785160666286296
This approach proved to be very useful in the distinction between high-grade and low-grade osteosarcomas as well as bone-forming intraosseous tumors.	0.8279226003763253
However distinguishing low-grade osteosarcomas from benign bone tumors by determining only the rate of proliferation was not possible, although interestingly, the proliferative rate of myositis ossificans, a purely reactive lesion, was in the range of the values determined for high-grade osteosarcoma.	0.7642531567279728
Over the past century numerous graft materials have been used for the reconstruction of the cruciate ligament of the knee.	0.7204785112726906
Among the autologous tissues that are currently recommended as graft materials, the central bone patellar tendon bone graft, a quadrupled hamstring graft and the central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance.	0.5570023207184899
With some limitations, allograft materials can also be used.	0.48081048272822774
Each of the three mentioned grafts has specific features regarding morphological and structural properties, graft fixation and graft incorporation.	0.5128770427034343
Clinical studies have failed to identify any of the three grafts as superior to the others.	0.6875375146256982
When choosing the graft for surgery the different anatomy and function of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments have to be considered.	0.6193078242111746
For the treatment of multiple ligament injuries and for revision cases, thorough preoperative planning is necessary and modified graft selection may be required.	0.5890654680755821
Myasthenic crisis is a lifethreatening complication of myasthenia gravis due to respiratory failure and inability to swallow and cough up secretions.	0.4317803204849522

Early referral to an experienced neurologist is essential.	0.26831084096454494
Specific therapy consists of symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, crisis management with plasmapheresis or immunoglobulins and immunosuppression with clucocorticoids.	0.3804288136618721
Infections must be treated vigorously.	0.24321285686740382
Thymectomy in patients with previously unrecognized myasthenia gravis is never urgently indicated and should be postponed until the patient is stabilized.	0.5455140005647854
In cases of impending respiratory failure and severe swallowing difficulties, early and elective admission to a specialized neurological intensive care unit and elective intubation should be performed.	0.6033924621376517
Adequate nursing care of intubated patients and a set of prophylactic measures are essential to avoid complications adversely affecting prognosis.	0.4820493672063539

There was also no deposit that converted from a transparent appearance to a dense structure.	0.4396112258494357
Patients with disappearance of the calcific deposit postoperatively had significantly better outcome than patients with no change in the X-ray.	0.4696412783386439
An additional acromioplasty did not improve the results.	0.3410401695178089
The aim of arthroscopic treatment of calcific tendinitis has to be the removal of the calcific deposit.	0.8092958547537358
Acromioplasty does not lead to further improvement of the result.	0.6428776130736976
Preventive strategies aim to reduce gastric acidity (H2ms (sucralfate, antacids, pirenzepine) and to normalize gastric mucosal microcirculation (sucralfate, pirenzepine).	0.47457022959824485
Thus, the most important prophylactic measure is an optimized emergency and ICU regime aiming to improve oxygenation and microcirculation.	0.6200311774509042
All specific drugs used for stress ulcer prophylaxis have been shown to be effective in prospective controlled studies.	0.48201196854792794
Furthermore, pirenzepine has been found to be superior to H2-antagonists, at least in neurosurgical patients.	0.5997399181258424
Insufficient or no data exist to support the use of prostaglandins or omeprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.	0.4012615598947393
The most important adverse effect of stress ulcer prophylaxis is nosocomial pneumonia due to gastric alkalinization.	0.45972416920207104
This may occur in long-term ventilated patients with a gastric pH>4 and may account for up to 50% of all nosocomial pneumonias in certain groups of patients.	0.7629255126610593
Mortality is not influenced by antacids or H2-antagonists, while sucralfate has been shown to reduce mortality, most probably by inhibition of bacterial translocation.	0.604107029567796
Three years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy, a 66-year-old man suffered from dyspnea and showed symptoms mainly due to right heart failure.	0.5638890137289416

Infection rates are important markers for clinical quality assurance.	0.3608685438264239
For internal control, they may only be used under the condition of homogeneous data collection and evaluation according to identical standard operating procedures during the entire investigation period.	0.5536480095110599
For inter-hospital comparison, they may only be used if additionally the observed patient groups are well defined and comparable.	0.5543060824777738
A survey of the infection rates published during the last 6 years in the German traumatological literature (n = 71) indeed shows (concerning series later than 1985) similar infection rates for procedures in less and in more problematic anatomical regions and in clean and contaminated situations of about 2 - 3%, after open injuries sporadically max.	0.6496724233368357
Finally, it is demonstrated that conclusions concerning a general "risk of infection" based on infection rates for specific surgical procedures are not possible and vice versa.	0.7024508350544395
We strongly recommend the future application of a standardized definition of wound infection.	0.5032349793517131
The differentiation between deep and superficial infection should be abandoned.	0.5212704246677805
For all mentioned "infection rates" it should be indicated whether it is with reference to the risk of infection of a specific procedure or only a general statement.	0.630050832553757
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are useful techniques for the objective documentation of the relation between the femoral head and the acetabulum after closed or open reduction of a developmental dislocation of the hip joint.	0.7039325131890021
Before the ossification nucleus of the femoral head is sufficiently developed, MRI is preferred.	0.6515878291724256
For the evaluation of reduction from the 2nd year on, MRI and CT are equivalent.	0.5691509054987978
However, in older children MRI may also be indicated for the evaluation of cartilaginous structures or the diagnosis of femoral head necrosis.	0.7313048500491806
CT in older patients may also be useful for 30 analysis of bony structures, e. g. for planning complex osteotomies.	0.6174823635143328
Careful diagnostic and early therapy are especially important in cases of scaphoid fractures.	0.49734281511089623
This is due to the patients being mostly young and the high number of non-unions of these carpal bones.	0.6310662807772267
Conservative and various operative treatments are therapeutical options.	0.3147989160566749
Out of the patients who underwent surgery from January 1993 to February 1999 42 patients with a scaphoid fracture and 88 patients with a scaphoid non-union were, in addition to standard X-ray examination, examined clinically and by MRI pre- and post-operatively.	0.8882319773438524

Furthermore, the relationships between cognitive deficits and psychological and sociodemographic variables were examined.	0.5371980516133608
The following prevalence rates were determined: 13.5% for age-associated memory impairment, 6.5% for age-consistent memory impairment, 1.5% for late-life forgetfulness and 23.5% for aging-associated cognitive decline.	0.8118368974691623
Subjective cognitive complaints did not correlate with results obtained from neuropsychological tests.	0.4584918917924669
Significant correlations were however found between subjective cognitive complaints and higher scores on depression and neuroticism scales.	0.40751601651766156
Significant correlations were also found between a reduced test performance and a lower educational level and socioeconomic status.	0.5778711187292664
Longitudinal studies are warranted to further elucidate the predictive value of these diagnostic concepts.	0.46968053932068227
In a retrospective study, we evaluated 180 patients treated for painful spondylolisthesis with combined anterior and posterior fusion.	0.7086309777242963
Group I included 90 patients treated by anterior fusion with the transperitoneal approach.	0.5651301605472075
Group II included 90 patients operated on with a retroperitoneal approach.	0.4504268529916435
Group II showed a higher incidence of pseudarthrosis L5/S1 (4 %), tear of the common iliac vein (1 %), postsympathectomy syndrome (4 %) and reversible L4 nerve-root lesion (3 %).	0.7179238759826863
On the basis of our findings, we recommend the transperitoneal approach for anterior interbody fusion L5 to S1 or L4 to S1.	0.580799924901392
Coronary surgery is at this point of time the standard therapy of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis.	0.7287125059958232
Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is performed only in bail out situations.	0.5292574362825161
The number of publications of successful percutaneous intervention in unprotected left main coronary stenosis is increasing because of increasing use of stents and ticlopidine to avoid stent-thrombosis.	0.4522200838397491
Within the context of an extensive study of electroconvulsive therapy at the Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Bonn 15 patients suffering from therapy-resistent Major depression (DSM III-R) were examined with a detailed psychometric test battery, containing memory- and nonmemory tests.	0.6439621349662287
The test battery had been applied short time before, during and after the treatment with 10 ECT applied unilateral over the nondominant hemisphere.	0.6306104230561156
Comparing the test performances before and 1-2 days after the end of the series there were only few remarkable changes: a significant decrease was diagnosed exclusively in 30 min delayed recall of verbal items, while visual short-term memory and visual-constructive performance showed a significant improvement (in spite of unilateral stimulation on the right side).	0.7830203468519575
None of the other cognitive functions inclusively speed of performances and reaction time was detracted short time after the end of the ECT-treatment, instead all the measures improved albeit not significantly.	0.4931131937789
Between responders to treatment (50% improvement in HAMD) and non-responders no significant differences neither before nor after the treatment were detected.	0.6922985206952578
The non-responders had in nearly all of the tests some better (but not significantly) results despite being older than the group of responders.	0.5941982991865795
In this study we assessed the drawing abilities in 37 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria.	0.5568071336089521
Drawing abilities (drawing: house, flower, clock; Rey-Osterrieth figure; copying: MMST-figure; Rey-Osterrieth figure) were quantified with different rating schemes and related to other neuropsychological assessments.	0.3895250313797588
All patients underwent a positron emission tomography with 18-FDG.	0.6718507869453799
Drawing performance was highly correlated with severity of dementia - expressed in MMST scores (r=0.78; p<0.0001) - with visuo-spatial short-term memory (r=-0.69; p=0.001), and writing abilities (r=-0.77; p<0.0001).	0.5532514841499806
The summarized drawing score showed a statistically significant correlation with the rate of temporoparietal glucose metabolism measured with positron emission tomography and 18-FDG (r=0.39; p=0.017).	0.4694559189649372
In the drawings of AD patients omittings and simplifications were typical, whereas perseverations rarely occured.	0.4494381536958204
In severely demented patients closing-in phenomenons could be de- scribed, too.	0.3325165486954723
A subgroup of AD patients with visuo-constructive impairment as the leading symptom could not be identified.	0.5733273227267309
Since the first dermatological outpatient clinic was started in Dresden in 1869, it has seen the practice of dermatology in the broadest sense, with scientific research activity and innovation.	0.663816895779216
The good working relationship between the dermatologists in private practice and those in the clinics has been the main factor in this successful development.	0.5998556174307721
The traditional background of the following sectors is highlighted: outpatient clinic, X-ray and UV ligth treatment, allergology and occupational dermatology, psychosomatic dermatology, dermatosurgery, and phlebology.	0.5965487275077811
A 12-year-old girl from Zaire with Aids (CDC: P2 D1) presented with a generalized molluscum contagiosum infection.	0.5954193639327451
She had suffered from systemic cryptococcosis and from cryptosporidiosis several months before admission.	0.3896433889203
While molluscum contagiosum infection is usually a self-limiting disease in immunocompetent persons, a fulminant appearance and persistence of giant mollusca occurs with advanced immunodeficiency.	0.5091427697479435
Histological and immunohistological examinations showed a severe diminution of Langerhans and T cell populations that might enhance the dissemination of the infection.	0.43226888913454153
Molluscum-like lesions of cryptococci have been described, and cutaneous cryptococcosis is the main condition to be considered in the differential diagnosis.	0.7196806271823534
Further differential diagnoses should include American and African histoplasmosis, and the cutaneous manifestations of mycobacterial infections, of toxoplasmosis and of Pneumocystis carinii infection.	0.6522214641345817
The search for vascular structures in skin tumors by incident light microscopy has revealed a surprisingly high proportion of vascularized tumours.	0.4224405159134825
Characteristic vascular patterns, in some cases highly tumour-specific, have been defined.	0.7118820138261064
The vascular structure is a valuable feature for characterization and differentiation of skin tumours, especially for amelanotic malignant melanoma.	0.6912862312174384
We propose a flowchart procedure for analysis and diagnosis of skin tumours using incident light microscopy, which appears to be valuable for advanced image analytic techniques.	0.5313250879474252
Introduction: The treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects still represents a problem that has not yet been solved satisfactorily.	0.639942095979682
Current methods used to cover defects in the knee joint are osteochondral cylinder transplantation (OCT) and autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT).	0.6079415019541196
Methods: With a prospective clinical investigation, at the time being with 2-year results, we have examined ACT in comparison to OCT in 20 patients with regard to clinical and histomorphological (histology, immunohistochemistry, RES) outcome.	0.8665038869167785
Results: We found equally good results with both methods in Lysholm, Meyers and Tegner Activity Scores.	0.6242903342254514
Histomorphologic evaluation of biopsies obtained by arthroscopy after ACT showed a defect filling in all cases, mainly with fibrous cartilage, while localized areas of hyalinelike regenerative cartilage were documented near the base.We did not see any histomorphologically visible change in the transplants after OCT.	0.5055945151278888
Conclusion: At the time we prefer OCT instead of ACT given the correct indication.	0.6565997660234548
This case report intends to focus attention on hemodynamic TIAs as cause of repetitive involuntary movements (RIMs) as differential diagnosis of simple partial motor seizures.	0.5434539591598607
We report two patients with episodic unilateral limb shaking lasting up to several minutes and which could be triggered by orthostasis, heat or physical exertion.	0.5091275989399838
Repeated EEG recordings revealed no epileptic discharges.	0.2190846632876009
In both patients, duplex ultrasonography revealed an occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) contralateral to the side of the RIMs.	0.5429419868889024
Blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to ICA occlusion were reduced and vasomotor reactivity to hypercapnia was absent.	0.42412463726561517
After elevation of blood pressure both patients became asymptomatic.	0.524519008326842
We suggest that in patients with episodes of RIMs, Doppler sonography and tests of cerebral vascular reserve capacity should be performed to search for a hemodynamic origin of these symptoms.	0.6833872890668116
Ethylene dichloride (EDC) is used as a solvent and in the rubber, plastic, and insecticide industry.	0.6760319150845158
The fatal adult dose is below 20 ml.	0.2371247760831484
Poisoning can occur from inhalation, ingestion or skin absorption.	0.3467799350892522
EDC depresses almost all cells, but essentially those of the central nervous system, liver, kidneys, and heart.	0.7088140759744582

Retrospectively analyzing the history of three patients with gastrointesinal stromal tumors (GIST) treated over a period of 1 year in the surgical department of our regional hospital, we tried to answer the following questions: using the current recommendations in the literature, how are the macro- and microscopic features and clinical presentation to be interpreted?	0.7293042411605535
Which prognostic and therapeutic conclusions should we draw, giving special consideration to practice-orientated management of such cases.	0.5134904313756263
The patients were 65, 75 and 88 years old respectively, and in each case the GIST manifested as recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.	0.7797986549558252
During surgical treatment four gastric tumors ranging in cross section between 2.5 and 8 cm were found.	0.5690606423586109
The GIST diagnosis was established after light microscopic and immunohistochemical examinations.	0.379125232230497
Going through the current literature, a large number of structural and immunohistochemical criteria have come to light for determining its classification and potential malignancy.	0.5180567433384531
On the other hand, very few subsequent recommendations concerning therapy and prognosis can be found and follow-up recomendations are almost unavailable.	0.5517684645524915
We conclude that GISTs are difficult to diagnose because of their locality and that their clinical behavior is uncertain.	0.511080922343516
The potential malignancy, on the other hand, requires a well-founded diagnostic procedure in the form of the best possible pre-therapeutic staging.	0.5907280062242964
Furthermore, initially radical surgical treatment should be adopted and the follow-up should be adapted to the risk involved.	0.6278987443106171
The latter is arbitrary and further clinical studies are required.	0.5157004994484221
In animal experiments and clinical studies liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons improves gas exchange and breathing mechanics in damaged lungs.	0.5536094472534328
According to the data on the toxicity of perfluorcarbons available today, it could potentially be applied in infants in the future, too.	0.8586026641603293
However, the catalogue of unanswered questions is still too long for controlled clinical phase III studies to be conducted.	0.47484635673166803
Further possible applications of liquid ventilation offer hope of solving open therapeutic and diagnostic problems.	0.415034025308479
Taking into account all available data about liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons today, we still do not know whether it is a real alternative method for respiratory support; however, further studies to investigate whether the method is an alternative strategy for artificial ventilation in neonates are justified.	0.6991134159563046
The role of elective lymph node dissection (ELND) in primary malignant melanoma is controversial.	0.6005210374049269
Our purpose was to evaluate the benefit of ELND regarding survival and disease-free survival in malignant melanoma of the trunk and extremities.	0.7022272694832501
By matched-pair analysis, 375 patients treated by wide local excision (WLE) plus ELND were compared to 375 patients treated by WLE only.	0.548791580239473
There was no difference in survival between the two treatment groups; however, the disease-free interval was significantly higher in the collective treated by WLE plus ELND (P<0.05).	0.7101972602830828
Increased survival rates were noted for intermediate tumor thickness of 1.51-4.0 mm for the WLE+ELND group although the difference was not significant (P=0.14), and disease-free survival was significantly improved in this group (P<0.001).	0.7594415238780718
ELND elicited a higher benefit in male patients with intermediate thickness melanoma.	0.37874982148505015
Our results confirm the findings of several studies that ELND improves the outcome after primary treament of malignant melanoma of intermediate tumor thickness.	0.6608438722236017
7 patients (5 female, 2 male; age:  22-81 years; average age=58,1 J) with recurrent necrotizing ANCA-negative, non leucocytoclastic vasculitis, were enrolled into this study.	0.7717344201491178
Disease was resistant to prior conservative therapy, and therefore patients received high dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) - (dose: 1,0 g/kg body weight daily dose 0,25 g/kg body weight over 4 consecutive days).	0.6569742832983628
All patients responded rapidly to this therapeutic regimen.	0.32729164752232043
Specifically immediate pain relief was striking.	0.43878340996833004
Complete clearance of disease was observed in 5 out of 7 patients within 6 months while receiving IVIG (0,5 g/kg body weight) every 4 weeks for one year.	0.7602193630381211
In 2 out of 5 patients ulceration and vasculitis healed completly and therapy could be stopped after 6 months.	0.449959693684566
In one patient treatment had to be discontinued due to decreasing kidney function.	0.5346440755479117
The data presented demonstrate that IVIG is an  effective and valuable therapeutic modality in treatment of severe vasculitis resistant to conventional therapy.	0.5263248901402254
However consideration of costs, effectiveness and possible side effects is needed for this therapeutic regime.	0.5869143974433368
After orthopedic surgery, skeletal muscle will enter the rehabilitation process in weakened condition due to the following characteristics.	0.5462603451932958
After use of a tourniquet during surgery, the muscle suffers ischemia/reperfusion damage due to oxidative stress, resulting in structural impairment.	0.5753917198841152
The resulting immobilization leads to muscular atrophy, with a loss of calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress being of etiological significance.	0.5279644971899619
Degeneration of muscle fibers as well as regeneration occurs in muscle while still immobilized.	0.3925988123462745
After remobilization, the muscle has impaired functional capacity and frequently shows disturbances in its innervation pattern.	0.48635008038123095
High mechanical loading should therefore be avoided, and electrical stimulation may be applied to facilitate recovery.	0.600196950904904
Considering the role of oxygen radicals, supplementation with vitamin E appears generally recommendable.	0.38714557241386155
The timing of surgery and postoperative radiotherapy - especially if combined with chemotherapy - has been a subject of interest over the past years.	0.9418978998751251
This analysis was based on a literature review of mostly retrospective publications.	0.6258024000479845
Data concerning the interval between surgery and radiotherapy were correlated with the locoregional control, incidence of distant metastases and prognosis of breast cancer, lung carcinoma, and head and neck carcinomas.	0.7268783901842931
The reviewed data did not show a clear relationship of the time interval between surgery and start of radiotherapy and locoregional control.	0.6254007987812221
However, evaluation of the data was difficult, because in most publications, retrospective analyses were performed and other prognostically more relevant parameters may influence locoregional control stronger than the time interval.	0.6630075884558753
In patients with head and neck carcinomas, there is a negative effect of time interval between surgery and radiotherapy on local control if unfavorable factors exist, i. e., close surgical margins, unfavorable pathohistological parameters and low radiation dose.	0.5784104102671536
In patients with breast cancer who do not receive chemotherapy, there are inconsistent reports in the literature.	0.6366658265614163
If additional chemotherapy is necessary, the sequence surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy seems adequate.	0.6158377234109373
Although some data suggest that delaying the initiation of radiotherapy due to chemotherapy may increase the risk or local recurrences, there may, on the other hand, be an increased likelihood of systemic metastases, if radiotherapy is applied before chemotherapy.	0.6626736248707044
Concerning lung cancer, only one retrospective analysis exists suggesting a better survival of patients with an interval of more than 36 days between surgery and radiotherapy as compared to patients with a shorter interval.	0.827643962842846
The treatment of severely injured patients is a challenge for preclinical and clinical treatment concepts, causing financial aspects of increasing importance for the German health care system.	0.7573999907528477
A total of 32,500 polytraumatized patients (PTS III and IV) are managed in trauma center levels I-IV in Germany.	0.6920066093339529
Trauma center levels I or II are by definition capable of supporting the full range of treatment for the severely injured.	0.4676086925744746
With the baseline calculation of 64,000 DM per patient and 104 polytrauma treated per year in the Berlin Virchow Clinic, 6.66 million DM primary costs must be spent for treatment.	0.5372822148071346
The total annual costs of this center are nearly 24 million DM for emergency cases and 7 million DM fixed costs per year, for a trauma center level I.	0.49564335423788525
In Europe the distribution of trauma center levels I or II is sufficient and can be specified with 1 center per 1 million inhabitants.	0.4975548794318112
Nevertheless, the european air medical service could support more intensive use of these central trauma institutions.	0.5139318164514156
This was shown by comparing the number of polytrauma patients and the number of trauma centers.	0.6030944583068428
Less then half of these patients are treated in levels I or II trauma centers.	0.7375463966752334
The financial pressure on the health system and the rising quality must lead to better utilization of trauma centers.	0.5217508732515254
To meet this goal a annual treatment rate of 300-400 polytrauma patients should be aimed at.	0.38113923188966425
The claim of the American College of Surgeons that a trauma surgeon should treat 50 severely injured patients per year would then be possible.	0.4439912582975527
This report is a retrospective investigation of the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies given to adults in a private practice setting and furthermore a study of the stability of the therapeutic results achieved.	0.6493647713442412
In the spring of 1997 a total of 16 bioenergetic therapists (6 of them medical doctors and 10 psychologists), all members of the Swiss Society of Bioenergetic Therapists (SGBAT), provided upon request a number of data on 319 patients who had terminated their therapies after a minimum of 20 sessions 6 months to 6 years earlier.	0.5895830522721112
A self-evaluating questionnaire was then constructed, to be answered anonymously, and was sent to these 319 patients in late summer 1997; 290 of them could be reached and 142 (49%) returned it.	0.6443178854369498
The questionnaire contained questions related to the psychic and physical condition, to interpersonal and psychosomatic problems, and to the effect of body work on physical consciousness, cognitive insights and changes of the quality of life.	0.8103383281506508
Regarding the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies, the statistical analysis of the returned questionnaires showed significant positive changes in all areas questioned.	0.5780381214354274
Bioenergetic body work was judged to be important and indispensable by about half of the patients.	0.5948406133125139
Regarding the stability of the therapeutic result, 107 patients indicated a stable or even improved condition.	0.4937122155383015
Of the 35 patients who since termination of the bioenergetic therapy had chosen to undergo further therapy, 16 opted again for a body-oriented psychotherapy.	0.5125147330977821
Purpose: In a clinical study 35 patients with intracranial aneurysms were examined using CT-angiography, MR-angiography (MRA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA).	0.76380293734956
The aim of the study was to establish the ability of noninvasive techniques to detect intracranial aneurysms.	0.7495618281803743
"Classic" choroidal neovascularization (CNV) has a relatively uniform appearance in fluorescein angiography.	0.5404904395428866
In contrast, indocyanine green (ICG) angiography shows variable features of well-defined CNV.	0.4684269424998015
We examined 31 classic CNV patients secondary to age-related macular degeneration using a confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (Heidelberg Retina Angiograph) in order to determine ICG characteristics of classic CNV.	0.47972301212971086
Vascular patterns (97%), a hypofluorescent rim (84%), a hyperfluorescent margin (42%), late ICG leakage (32%) and "feeder vessels" were identified in variable frequency.	0.7030116343546795
Some of the ICG characteristics may correlate with histological features of the membrane and reflect proliferative activity.	0.5644050563482961
Extrafoveal "feeder vessels" may be amenable to laser photocoagulation in the presence of subfoveal CNV.	0.4074477008316986
In situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR in situ hybridization are new diagnostic tools in dermatopathology.	0.5251465647129433
These techniques can combine the sensitivity of PCR with the advantage of in situ hybridization to localize specific cellular structures.	0.5912142614199991
With optical control of the PCR reaction product in these techniques, false-positive results due to contamination can be minimized.	0.6260316305127901
Several working protocols have been established which allow detection of DNA and RNA sequences in a rapid and reproducible manner.	0.542706416186875
Two different methods have been established to detect the amplification product, the indirect PCR in situ hybridization (PCRisHyb), and the direct in situ PCR (is PCR).	0.708799299854149
An easy and reproducible method for PCRisHyb and isPCR in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue is described and the two techniques are compared.	0.4669950675674923
Using both isPCR and PCRisHyb, the amplification product can be visualized with an optimal morphological preservation of the tissue.	0.5458422114355647
Indirect PCRisHyb showed a slightly higher specificity whereas direct isPCR was the quicker, easier and less expensive method.	0.3099372525349328
In a randomized study 30 patients with chronic stationary psoriasis were treated with 3 different topical schemes.	0.6990568727120519
Group 1 (n=10) received monotherapy (dithranol (D) twice a day, D/D), group 2 (n=10) calcipotriol mornings/dithranol evenings (calcipotriol (C)/dithranol (D) C/D) and 3 (mometasone (M) mornings/dithranol (D) evenings, M/D).	0.5833980372322495
During the therapy period of 4 weeks we documented the PASI-Score as well as infiltration, erythema and desquamation weekly.	0.5274147717514079
The M/D group revealed in the first week a significantly faster reduction of the PASI-score (5,3) than in the D/D group (PASI 13,22).	0.8194297889971367
The C/D group (PASI 10,5) show a not significantly faster reduction.	0.5876758659261045
After 4 weeks of treatment and after a follow period of 6 weeks there were similar PASI-Scores in all groups.	0.8065492311931921
There were less side-effects in the M/D group than in the others.	0.7733198186913323
The beginning, more anti-psoriatic effectiveness was achieved by the mometasone/dithranol combination than the other schemes.	0.548928167423313
In the long term, the effects were similar.	0.8727327234629136
This report describes a distinctive pattern of findings in peripheral sensory-nociceptive afferent nerves after spinal injury.	0.4355487905752768
Subsequent to trauma there was segmental, multisegmental or hemilateral hypoaesthesia with refractory, intenseful painful symptoms.	0.30479143697346733
None of the classical neurological causes for such hypoaesthesia were present.	0.47175452280146807
"Normal" therapy resulted in more severe symptoms.	0.47083492663451404
Depending on the distribution of the hypo- or anaesthesia, there were also efferent symptoms (coordination problems, impairments of proprioception, etc.).	0.6817150434552025

Methods: After approval by our institutional review board, 62 patients (ASA I-II) were randomly assigned to three groups to receive either 3xED95 or 5xED95 cisatracurium, or 3xED90 vecuronium as a rapid bolus.	0.5790446520217213
A prick test was done the day before by scarification of the skin in the forearm.	0.6392136980738461
After premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam, anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone (4-12 mg/kg) and maintained with O2/N2O and isoflurane (1.5-2 vol.%).	0.6865030233538202
Six minutes after thiopentone, the patients received the relaxant, and after further 6 min 0.1-0.2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated.	0.8845120690695015
Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored every minute.	0.6610109061748038
Blood samples for histamine were withdrawn 5 min prior 3 and 5 min after each drug administration (thiopentone, relaxants).	0.46339735821972367
Plasma histamine was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 pg/ml.	0.6197771806906336
Additionally, serum tryptase was measured by RIA at baseline (-10 and  -1 min) and 15 and 60 min after the relaxant administration.	1.0092916121639934
Levels for histamine >1000 pg/ml and for tryptase >2 µg/ml were considered significant.	0.6495278961509823
Cutaneous signs of histamine release were documented.	0.3160263971193375
Results: Ten patients showed a positive prick-test reaction.	0.6315695928679543
Only after thiopentone some cutaneous signs (4 flush, 1 erythema) of histamine release were observed.	0.7563401246997717
There were no cutaneous signs of histamine release correlating with cardiovascular changes.	0.4917354384536286
Analysis of the blood samples demonstrated no significant increase in the histamine level in all three groups.	0.8616026935384716
Only in 1 patient was a significant higher histamine level (1133 pg/ml) measured 5 min after 5xED95 cisatracurium.	0.6787977634975523
All measurements of serum tryptase were within the physiological limits.	0.4424458635763212
Discussion: In this study, with the particular time course of drug administration, neither cisatracurium nor vecuronium increased plasma histamine levels.	0.7213619019446599
Only after 5xED95 cisatracurium was 1 elevated histamine level documented after 5 min.	0.3386463381468444
In several studies increased histamine levels have been described, but without clinical manifestations.	0.7645133517150551
It is known that cutaneous signs can occur without increased plasma histamine levels due to the structural heterogeneity of mast cells.	0.5381411625426338
The cutaneous reactions in this study were caused by thiopentone.	0.7545186567679252
The tryptase values were within normal limits even in the patient with histamine release.	0.6895887704921709
No relationship between the positive results in the prick test and the incidence of cutaneous reactions and/or histamine release for drugs used in the induction of anaesthesia was observed.	0.7469857624603096

After femorofemoral coupling on the heart-lung machine, right ventricular relieve was rapidly attained.	0.4490733644210686
During the course of a 3-hour period of extracorporal circulation, the initially significantly elevated pulmonary pressures were able to be reduced to moderate levels.	0.6840551540016315
Correspondingly, right ventricular recovery could be echocardiographically determined.	0.3780608186531084
As a consequence of this development, and after preclusion the presence of any large thrombotic masses which might have been situated in the pulmonary trunk, it was possible to forego thoracotomy and embolectomy.	0.7449824093049637
This procedure allowed, on the one hand, the avoidance of imminent right ventricular failure through the use of the heart-lung machine.	0.6990589845022835
On the other, due to the lessening of the degree of surgical intervention, the risk of grave hemorrhaging as a result of concurrent thrombolytic therapy could be minimalized.	0.6215386206597043
After an uneventful course, the patient was able to be transferred on the second postoperative day with normal pulmonary pressure values.	0.8327228088422755

We observed two patients with stone formation in the renal pelvis two and five years after pyeloplasty.	0.5801342206945629
In both cases there was no obstruction of the pyeloureteral junction detectable.	0.6242075559602961
We consider the use of Polyglactin (Vicryl) for the pelvis suture as reason for the stone formation.	0.6074294207180624
For stone removal we favourite an endoscopic procedure, in which a removal of residuums of the suture is even possible as the verification of the pyeloureteral junction.	0.632065223386569
Aim of the study: The aim was to determine the efficiency of a secure control of ventilation in emergency medicine by using capnometry.	0.7501892836134689

Starting a specific immunotherapy (SIT) and its maintenance may be lifesaving for the allergic patients.	0.5574764436860101
Performing a prospective study, we exactly documented effects and side effects during the induction phase of SIT using a purified aqueous yellow jacket venom preparation in 20 patients allergic to yellow jacket venom (clinical degree II-IV).	0.535810118497975
Indication for the therapy was defined individually for each patient and was based on a score incorporating the following criteria: a) clinical symptoms, b) in-vivo- and in-vitro testing, c) risk of re-sting.	0.9385050441892977
SIT was started under inpatient conditions following a standardized 8 day protocol.	0.31273560650051785
At the end of the induction phase all patients tolerated the maintenance dose of 100 µg of yellow jacket venom without complications even though all showed local side effects (threshold doses 0.01-10 µg, median value 0.2 µg).	0.6041097375751261
40% of all patients showed subjective side effects (median value of threshold dose 30 µg, range 0.2-60 µg) and 30% showed objective side effects (median value of threshold dose 55 µg, range 20-80 µg); however, all side effects were clinically mild.	0.8476091248972636
When objective systemic side effects were seen, the cumulative daily dose was 39-210 µg (median value 135 µg), exceeding 100 µg in 83% of patients.	0.692903947252209
Our prospective study confirmed that the chosen protocol for SIT is effective in inducing tolerance to the venom preparation.	0.4549111157333896
However, using a purified aqueous yellow jacket preparation did not result in reduction of side effects.	0.5200585942728227
A 76 year old patient with actinic reticuloid was treated with Cyclosporin A.	0.5664548027326605
11 months after beginning the immunosuppressive therapy, he developed lymphoedema and livid nodular skin lesions of the right leg, which histologically showed Kaposi's sarcoma.	0.7028435498955322
After stopping the Cyclosporin A and intralesional therapy with Interferon alpha, no regression of the Kaposi sarcoma could be seen.	0.5542468494740198
The characteristics of Kaposi sarcoma arising during immunosuppressive therapy and the differences in incidence, risk groups and distribution pattern compared to the classic sporadic and the AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma will be described.	0.6282464575129634
The development of Kaposi sarcoma during immunosuppressive therapy for actinic reticuloid has not been previously described.	0.4948189762858321
This analysis was undertaken to review the outcome and toxicity of postoperative adjuvant therapy for Stage II and III rectal cancer.	0.6093890047110154
We reviewed 112 patients treated with radiotherapy (44 patients) and radiochemotherapy (68 patients) after potentially curative (R0) surgery for rectal cancer (UICC Stages II and III), between 1983 and 1994 at the University Clinic of Würzburg.	0.7535044995698104
Median radiation dose was 56 Gy (range: 45 to 66 Gy).	0.5003429352279625
Chemotherapy consisted of 4 to 6 courses of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (420 mg/m2/d) and leucovorin (200 mg/m2/d).	0.7475645027809933
Median follow-up was 37 months.	0.6592060800732462
The overall survival was 84% for patients with UICC Stage II and 45% for patients with UICC Stage III disease (p = 0.0045).	0.7319021859622146
There were no statistically significant differences between patients treated with radiochemotherapy vs radiotherapy in terms of 5-year survival (63% after radiochemotherapy vs 53% after radiotherapy, p = 0.16), relapse-free survival (52% vs 50%) and locoregional control (69% vs 67%).	0.829655914104353
UICC Stage III disease was associated with high failure rates (40% pelvic recurrences and 53% distant metastases).	0.547703141117582
There was a statistically significant difference in terms of the incidence of distant metastases between the 2 treatment modalities for patients with Stage III disease (49% 5-year probability for developing distant metastases after radiochemotherapy vs 66% after radiotherapy, p = 0.047).	0.6767890810232793
In a multivariate analysis, the addition of chemotherapy, lymph node stage and grading were independent prognostic factors for survival.	0.6108142584277934
Severe late toxicity was documented in 5% of treated patients.	0.6515998164804907
Prognosis of patients with UICC Stage III rectal cancer remains poor after "standard" surgery followed by postoperative adjuvant treatment (pelvic radiotherapy and bolus intravenous injection of 5-FU and leucovorin).	0.599875676842871
Major efforts should be made in order to improve prognosis for these patients, including optimization of surgical treatment and systemic treatment.	0.8261791239601831
More effective multimodality treatment strategies should be investigated in prospective randomized trials.	0.5334431374661491

Invasive selective coronary angiography as a clinical method is about 40 years old.	0.46244086335052403
This article surveying this period, written by an R&D engineer, deals with four parts: first the situation before 1965 is touched upon.	0.38644844136794065
For the time after 1965 the second and third parts describe the development of the procedure and of the technique with special reference to the work of Prof. Dr. K. Bachmann and to the facility, which in 1967 was designed together with him and further developed.	0.7844800853548034
K. Bachmann had already taken up the method of invasive coronary angiography around 1965, which makes him one of the group of pioneering users who developed the fundamentals of the procedure and led coronary angiography to its self-evident use today.	0.624570573174106
The first clinical application of high resolution image intensifiers with the input screen produced from evaporated cesium iodide in 1971 appears as one of the highlights of the continuous improvements of the facility.	0.45075720061238594
The fourth part of the article sketches the status of today and, considering the new methods using MRI, EBCT as well as CT, it predicts that the invasive coronary angiography will remain an indispensable method at least for the medium-term future.	0.6362090908541153
Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole) have revolutionized the therapy of peptic disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract and reduced the indications for surgical intervention.	0.6980018093144248
These substances inhibit the H+/K+-ATPase in the parietal cells with an acid suppressing potency that is much higher than that of H2-receptor-antagonists.	0.4484712914073031
The first proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, has been introduced ten years ago.	0.5569390657491444
Since then, sufficient experience with this drug in children has accumulated.	0.6306447188329332
Omeprazole is released for children aged one year or older.	0.32089635304956743
A new formulation makes the drug applicable in tube fed patients.	0.3079393448083713
The main indications for the use of omeprazole are endoscopically verified peptic esophagitis and gastric and duodenal ulcerations of different etiologies.	0.4275144782589967
In the treatment of Helicobacter pylori-infection a sufficient acid suppression is essential for the efficacy of the antibiotics.	0.5264770741043399
The recommended pediatric dose ranges between 0,7-1,4 mg/kg bodyweight and day.	0.6663626885704519
However, some children with ulcerative esophagitis may need daily doses up to 3.5 mg/kg.	0.7398116611369957
Healing of the esophageal mucosa should be monitored by endoscopy.	0.4651621135034191

Nosocomial urinary tract infections (UTI) are frequent complications after transurethral prostatectomy.	0.6252579262293116
The resection itself, postoperative catheterization and the prostate are possible causes of these infections.	0.6389277989938255
In this prospective study we investigated the influence of bacterial prostatic colonization on the incidence of postoperative urinary tract infections and inflammatory complications.	0.6552267759893745
In 78 patients we observed in 42 cases (53,8%) a bacterial prostatitis.	0.727104573956791
In 14 patients (17,9%) we found nosocomial UTI's and in 12 patients (15,4%) inflammatory complications.	0.814367795124906
The incidence of postoperative UTI's increase significantly in patients with positive prostate-cultures.	0.6688248700995556
On the other hand we only found corresponding prostate- and postoperative urine-cultures in less than 50%.	0.7422165556079384
The presented data are not sufficient to conclude the kind of relevance of bacterial prostatic colonization for postoperative UTI's in transurethral prostatectomy.	0.5184636696058929
Under consideration of the significant increase of nosocomial UTI's in patients with positive prostate cultures a perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis seems to be required in general.	0.6559532935181482
Apnea, bradycardia and oxygen desaturation in infants with very low birth weight are common findings in neonatal intensive care.	0.4657558513032543
The prognostic significance of their intensity and frequency and the principles of treatment, however, are controversial.	0.5513280067754234
The universal aim, in order to prevent traumatization of the lung, is to ventilate infants with very low birth weight for as short a time as possible.	0.6250602060734262
Therefore drugs such as theophylline, aminophylline and doxapram and techniques such as nasal CPAP have been studied in our neonatal intensive care unit.	0.44408461067337873
In these studies we developed a treatment algorithm.	0.5535741149207245
In two clinically controlled studies performed successively we first proved that sodium acetate theophylline given intravenously has the same efficacy as aminophylline.	0.34643891611237854
As aminophylline has more side effects, sodium acetate theophylline is preferable.	0.30164299637907643
Bradycardia, apnea and desaturation were registered from the print-out of the monitoring system's trend analysis and in a polysomnographic study during steady-state conditions.	0.5134182728497663
In a historical study we were able to prove that intravenous injection of aminophylline is superior to oral administration.	0.487274498171122
We demonstrated equal efficacy of doxapram and theophylline; however, doxapram reduced the rate of apnea significantly more during the first 3 days of treatment.	0.5284721401958639
In a retrospective study we analyzed the efficacy of nasal CPAP as the third level of treatment.	0.6101588428347821
The rate of bradycardia, apnea and desaturation was significantly reduced during CPAP and respiratory rate and oxygenation improved.	0.45243025951323074
The algorithm developed established theophylline with 5 mg/ kg as bolus infusion over 20 min, followed by 3 mg/kg BID as the first line of treatment.	0.5151015351461171
Only if a quick therapeutic response was desirable was doxapram the first drug of choice (indication >=4 bradycardias below 80/min, 4 desaturations below 80% or 2 apneas of >=20 s over 2 h).	0.5605457989399052
After 48 h an additional second drug was added if we could still observe >=3 apneas, 15 bradycardias or 15 desaturations over this period.	0.4009473864991329
Nasal CPAP was introduced as the third line of treatment.	0.458607466551874
With this treatment algorithm we were able to reduce the time on a respirator of infants with very low birth weight from 4.9 to 3.4 days (P<0.01).	0.6415713195741166
An evaluation of similar treatment algorithms in multi-institutional studies is indicated.	0.3354642066453221
Background: Associations between back pain, the quality of sleep and the quality of matresses have not yet been investigated systematically.	0.6354649612790272
Methods: At check-out we asked 265 consecutive guests of a trade fair hotel about the subjective quality of sleep in the previous night.	0.4966915951233748
Nine rooms had been equipped with new mattresses of three different qualities and prices, but this was kept blind to the hotel staff and the guests.	0.5627926019802684
Sleep quality was assessed on an analog scale between 1 (very good) and 5 (very bad) and was analyzed in comparison to the remaining 8-year old mattresses of the hotel, but also with respect to social (e.g.	0.8696435608918032
private vs. professional reason for the stay) as well as personal (e.g.	0.4354960407708037
previous experience with low back and sleep complaints) characteristics of the guests.	0.5116069076716488
Results: The three qualities of the mattresses correlated significantly and positively with the perceived quality of sleep, but the difference to the "old" mattresses was most pronounced for those guests who were staying overnight for professional reasons, or who frequently were suffering from low back pain or sleep disturbances.	0.6099045653756788
Conclusion: At least for chronic sufferers from back pain and sleep problems, the association between sleep quality and quality of the mattress is significant.	0.8181783390459438
Body oriented psychotherapy is used nowadays in in-patient and out-patient settings, individually or in groups, alone or combined with other methods.	0.5536252928134208
These methods have special importance in patients whose body feeling is reduced, who are restricted in their emotions, or for those who are difficult to reach because of resistances of character.	0.6716789376713617
Short examples are given as an introduction to the methods used often the most nowadays, reference is made to other procedures.	0.5503700275657861
The connection of emotions to the vegetative and autonomic nervous system inter alia and the link between emotional and physical processes which is especially strong to the beginning of life and which combines with the specifically experienced form of interaction and has psychobiological consequences are mentioned as active factors.	0.4857289897262694
In later development, the body and certain parts of the body acquire a symbolical meaning too, which is important for the therapy.	0.8330862512494984
