LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2.	0.40647153792034985
LEADER + can cover all the regions of the EU, while LEADER 2 covered only the Objective 1 regions and some Objective 5b and 6 regions.	0.696188634914872
We must point out, however, that even if the actual appropriations available for LEADER + were increased, the Community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the anti-farming nature of the CAP that will be implemented in the context of 'Agenda 2000' and the WTO. The real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover-up, to lead people off the scent and to salve consciences.	0.8243022432214008
We disagree with many of the report' s views.	0.7917543395458221
Once more, we point to the negative changes of the CAP (1992 - Agenda 2000).	0.838682327236323
We do not think LEADER + will contribute substantively towards solving the countryside' s problems, which are characterised by the decline of farming, which was and should remain the countryside' s basic social and economic branch.	0.8936241657864038
For our part, we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes.	0.734243375255124
We will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wasted, and most important of all, we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous CAP which is disinheriting them and leading them towards economic decline and the desertion of the countryside.	0.7152824524904964
Unless this CAP is overthrown, no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside.	0.702632061691682
All the Members in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted in favour of almost the whole of the Procacci report on the LEADER + Community Initiative.	0.6656453526621763
However, we amended the draft report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain points which will make this Community initiative more effective.	0.8490225496268675
In particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the LEADER II initiative.	0.6045024973140779
It was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LEADER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density.	0.7189638672389647
Amendment No 10 which I tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of 'economic and social cohesion' rather than 'regional development' as the European Union does not have any recognised competence in this area.	0.8310990274093755
Amendment No 11 replaces 'government or municipal officials' with 'government officials' .	0.4075584688146246
Although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio-economic sectors of the territory concerned, government officials must be involved at decision-making level, whether they come from the municipalities, departments, regions or national governments.	0.7292145894808276
The rapporteur' s phrasing was therefore too limiting.	0.26745099456521115
Amendment No 12 responds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of this House.	0.6393043220415553
It specifies the necessary coordination between LEADER + and Community cooperation and partnership programmes such as INTERREG, PHARE, Sapard or MEDA.	0.39073089086904084
In the territory of Member States of the European Union, applicant countries or Member States of EFTA, there may be interrelations between the various Community initiatives.	0.8552507611749148
The real priority for the European continent is to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur.	0.918475279793052
The creation of organisations similar to the LAGs may be usefully encouraged by the European Union, provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners.	0.6564036561582323
In essence, we are, of course, in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative.	0.8006422549720278
The conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric, including infrastructure, public and private services and so on.	0.7050924351602681
In this context, in committee we regretted the paltry funding allotted to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increased budget for this Community initiative so that it matches the previous LEADER I and LEADER II initiatives.	0.7226286721526831
The budget allocated to LEADER + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to LEADER II for a period of six years.	0.48094129387692575
This is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements.	0.832529211296475
Finally, among the priority parameters to be introduced at European level to enable local involvement, particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been implemented by LAGs within the LEADER II initiative, but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified.	0.8286342920494251
(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	0.33028813644394045
Additives in feedingstuffs	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0015/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (COM(1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS)).	0.46418146248895137
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, under Directive 70/524, high-technology additives are treated differently, depending on the date of authorisation.	0.6670619830461414
The Commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances licensed before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now.	0.55112205218539
As far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned, so far so good.	0.9114647251292628
However, the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics, drugs, growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms.	0.6713204824867972
That makes it a question of health, not just approximating laws, which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article 37 - is not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 152, that is to say with codecision by Parliament.	1.083397381432796
We asked the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which pointed out that, as far as approximating laws is concerned, Article 37 is adequate in this case.	0.7740351579776635
However, we in the Committee on Agriculture have not confined ourselves to approximating laws; because this proposal also encompasses genetically-modified organisms, we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health.	0.9261255457670808
We negotiated with the Commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of genetically-modified organisms in the directive, taking the text on which Directive 70/524 is based as a starting point.	0.7470537096229342
Mr Byrne, we fail to understand why the Commission is not approximating the text on genetically-modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work.	0.9331662370433056
We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text.	0.81119908078886
Moreover, this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well.	0.9512466389578188
The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future.	0.6104825683594787
However, that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives.	0.9175403937268796
We are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically-modified organisms.	0.6976545453144808
Directive 70/524 still contains the old text because the seed directive was submitted to Parliament in 1986 and we then negotiated with the Commission until 1988, while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994 and Parliament obviously did not accord genetically-modified organisms the same importance then as it did later when I was rapporteur.	0.7297592343167889
We therefore assume, Commissioner Byrne, that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base.	0.9253028109701369
If you do not, we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you, exactly as we did with the seed directive. I should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise, both for your legal service and ours.	0.9330617972738303
In other words, we do not need to re-negotiate the text; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive.	0.7480157254647332
I can hardly wait, Commissioner Byrne, to hear what you have to say to our proposals.	1.161510608038404
Mr President, Commissioner, does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy?	0.6269393526056752
As far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned, it comes under competition.	0.9845987935355891
Of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988.	0.757867521938072
We want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle' s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support.	0.5847981365801449
However, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report, this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter.	0.9536661738633755
Food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions.	0.4143634305577531
When we talk of transparency in the food chain, that applies from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs.	0.7500596599006725
The antibiotics, growth promoters and genetically-modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain.	0.6052594763587287
The dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction.	0.7088144633785239
According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty, we are obliged to obviate sources of danger to human health, whereby the accent is clearly on sources.	0.6751407530926634
Consequently, we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger, i.e. harmful additives in feedingstuffs.	0.7292496049598517
Otherwise, in my view, we are beavering away at the symptoms, but not the causes.	1.0280109664522916
People are especially wary of GMOs.	0.19470933144044295
We must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly.	0.44180102558534345
First, if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms, then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment.	0.7353838611117096
Secondly, it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation, as the rapporteur has said.	0.9499186254321698
And thirdly, if we are to have a transparent consumer policy, we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs.	0.9246785695650894
A clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice, both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer.	0.6715022775355611
Responsible citizens should, in my view, have a choice.	0.863171577416792
We all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety.	0.4772113605629185
By regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently, we can help significantly to restore confidence.	0.8861678607850639
I too, therefore, can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments.	0.9723999899374355
Consequently, we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be.	0.7921917078803836
Mr President, this proposal to amend the 1970 directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs.	0.9110815032908822
In other words, we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months.	0.880195648973811
That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin, antibiotic, sludge and other scandals have attracted.	0.4889746437196235
In other words, this is an important facet of public health protection, which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base, not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission.	1.0789565133607566
The amendment which the Commission has proposed, namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987, is uncontested and has our full support.	0.8227466642793664
However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal.	0.9589124515562645
The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives.	0.5996973855461254
Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded.	0.6711384923894784
This sort of monopoly, which could lead, for example, to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs, should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998.	0.7724539761283791
This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed.	0.5214927015047345
The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion, as recommended by the rapporteur, of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives, taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point.	1.0292805283070876
This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs.	0.6054449580753509
It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case, just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas, such as forest reproductive material, to mention just one example.	0.8419984475172339
The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect.	0.7101277587382785
On the one hand, it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and, on the other hand, it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs.	0.8078632212563197
Finally, our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur, who has gone to a great deal of trouble.	0.9443079808174331
I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne' s reply.	0.8061033212708664
Mr President, the report deals mainly with formalities, in other words, the manner in which additives will be authorised. It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work.	0.8098609256223926
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview.	0.8490585242234061
We cannot carry on as we have done up until now, that is to say dealing with each detail on its own, often only after the harm has already been done.	0.8768081673700235
The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives.	0.4535461351385006
However, I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics.	0.9157213255589093
Certainly, five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned.	0.5874334243877382
It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four, both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves.	0.7930075797001438
We now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people's health, particularly in the case of small children.	0.6902521336445938
A number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary.	0.5362354448926215
Several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same.	0.5642483909688917
We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but, in the case of antibiotics, it has long since been forgotten.	0.8892277281104414
However, there is another environmental principle at stake, namely the exchange principle.	0.8262229557745977
I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats.	0.6914088905075014
They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary.	0.7735669218489644
There is a substitute, which is used to vaccinate chickens.	0.9035836945646083
Although it is a little more expensive, it does not harm the environment.	1.0706078402726817
Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields. In that way, they end up in our water supplies which, as we all know, are our most vital resource.	0.8965286365833197
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives.	0.6897191690085286
Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition.	0.6242279081206091
You may recall, even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public, that the Commission' s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil.	0.5699689028492869
We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals.	0.6642147625307213
Incidentally, it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs, cats and other domestic animals.	0.5919636894295243
Is it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry?	0.551931208150701
Such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate, even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters.	0.7980481052521312
The precautions which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates.	0.7371544242456591
As forcefully underlined by this report, labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock.	0.5778656828898787
He must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health.	0.3550623792973461
In any case, the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly traceable at all stages of their marketing.	0.5419353853255958
However, before labelling we need clear rules.	0.6765585109707897
Straight questions must be asked about the real end-use of animal meal, for example.	0.6071171818593242
Although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms, it is their use which must be questioned today.	0.7786041380315417
In this respect, the chapter of the White Paper on food safety which deals with feedingstuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions.	0.5571079124733546
The Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined.	0.6773574681486921
This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and, to do this, the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time.	1.0479771922759558
This is why it is essential to approve Amendment No 2 to Recital 4 which avoids the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re-evaluation procedure.	0.6862640906282657
Also, Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such, thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions.	0.6869113448093681
Mr President, because of the availability of high-technology additives in the feedingstuffs industry, detailed information on their use is needed from the actors, and as we know there are a lot of them, so that we can put a stop to practices which infringe Community law.	0.8785343175557808
This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own.	0.6308937690143335
Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them.	0.809382865572454
Up the point at which meat, milk, bread and other products are sold over the shop counter, feedingstuffs and additives are structured, mixed, blended, cut and transported several times.	0.42496507065661815
The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems, just as it does in the foodstuffs industry.	0.7069415601479393
The negative consequences are well known, the positive ones less so.	0.751632731556824
I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region.	0.8099200527068309
However, more work is needed on this.	0.7517858485697183
Mr President, may I commence by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on his report.	0.8165121885218316
It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality.	0.7900697337169958
The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health.	0.7195860898979998
The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future, for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform.	0.8700799634880768
But even in this crucial area of administration, Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility.	0.7861762566327299
In Agenda 2000, we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens: food safety, water quality, environmental protection and rural development.	0.913086100777801
If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence, the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs.	0.7696699551406873
I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds.	0.6022002627110986
Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely.	0.39150964836306223
I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety, Mr Byrne.	0.6168026887031977
He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House, as well as to the concern of consumers.	0.7399497298031883
I am particularly pleased that my own country, Ireland, is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability.	0.8565730469607151
This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production.	0.8527168863731484
Mr President, Commissioner, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group.	1.1016855447490745
It is therefore specified that, through the adoption of a regulation, the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation. This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question.	0.9504755467333142
A coherent legal framework must be re-established.	0.3476867508066087
As of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70/524/EEC for the replacement of the authorisations.	0.559206440920584
However, we must ensure that competition distortions are not created, as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi.	0.8428050315568423
Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this.	0.671677234420855
The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision.	0.688187668170797
This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget.	0.784478500139882
There must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety.	0.5866951714272542
I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	1.0179059910652841
Mr President, we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection.	0.9378666669358793
We therefore welcome the Commission' s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs.	0.7438628686248792
The Committee on behalf of which I am speaking, namely the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, decided in December, on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture would draft such a good report, that we could waive our opinion.	0.9911881361827042
Nevertheless, I should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points.	0.8721838431401258
First, perhaps, I should say something on the question of the legal base.	1.162512818303637
Even if we have new Rules of Procedure in Parliament, and it may well be that, with such an ambitious chairman in the Committee on Agriculture, problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment, one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict: cohesion in this Parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as I am concerned.	1.0227866122862916
Therefore, and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne, I reject your choice of legal basis.	0.9153850010605773
If it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives, then it is a mistake to keep it.	0.8551598145199654
The Treaty of Amsterdam states quite clearly that, where people' s health is concerned, Article 152 is the correct legal base, and may I say to our own Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it is simply not good enough to look at the Commission' s proposal and say, there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection, so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection.	0.9263828525967202
My group, as Mr Kindermann has already said, will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise.	1.0623133146009798
Mr Byrne, I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation.	0.9267150080892761
If we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee, we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation.	0.8314431164351216
The Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article 37.	0.7278774420209397
Allow me to comment briefly on two other points. First, genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs.	0.5973322760338804
We cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law.	0.7322496019616942
We do not have another law at the moment, and until we do, we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled.	0.8847403056208082
The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign.	1.1713025431264326
I say now, as I have said on numerous occasions in the past: yes, I too would like the Commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this House, but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs.	1.0638712109449948
It is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the Member States.	0.6589853549660355
There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet.	0.8796421173000324
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.	0.7364972681261222
This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future.	0.9616394855630096
What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers.	0.8182474885177721
We must strike a balance between them.	0.44328955132863834
We must resolve this issue, because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat.	0.8315773424292164
One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned.	0.8641097856038201
GMOs are the new challenge facing us.	0.45854137074681567
This is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so: I myself share these concerns.	0.7111716877997208
But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed.	0.6842179815921575
Indeed, we should not allow GMOs to obscure the fact that meat and bonemeal are still included in animal feeds in many countries in Europe.	0.7114616373329165
One factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food.	0.9137281380133067
These are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field: food must be of the same standard in all Member States.	0.9177903531882723
We have had the dioxin scare, BSE and many other problems.	0.8222199382148118
The main problem is a financial one, namely who bears the cost?	0.7924623430570499
The problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer: the producer has been forced to bear all the cost.	0.7273299066858926
We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred.	0.6353079770651618
We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union.	0.75902136230125
If we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future.	0.466748640379946
. I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur, the committee chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for examining the Commission's proposal.	1.1024089279500346
The Commission proposal is, as some of you have said, rather technical.	1.2620720441040638
Nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective: to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives.	0.598888887108584
At present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations, depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 January 1988.	0.4930769968455486
The purpose of the Commission's proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists.	0.9787083886720966
The scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited.	0.7865423759235436
Five amendments have been presented by Parliament.	0.6973245767182773
I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments, despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament, the Agricultural Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on these issues.	1.0113933561871165
I shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately.	0.5882458908381542
The first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing Article 37 with Article 152.	0.7206745354491468
I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection.	0.9624336379030827
The proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health.	0.626861257309658
I note that Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also accepts that Article 37 is the appropriate legal base.	0.5566865365161449
I remind Parliament that in Article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health.	0.5704733468292671
I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position, in my view, with precision, clarity and commendable brevity.	0.7491676917197658
Amendments Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives.	0.7015473402080162
I am the first to accept that GMOs are a very important issue.	0.9638376023890848
I also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiatives to update EU legislation in the field of GMOs are necessary.	0.5157106553577315
However, this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives.	0.9234204149392434
The Commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by Directive 70/524 on genetically modified additives at this stage.	0.8000568408938219
Instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90/220, which is currently in second reading in Parliament.	0.8231232798045139
The Commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments.	0.6017801951829588
I can also assure Parliament that I will ensure that the pertinent provisions of Directive 90/220 are included in the proposal for a recasting of Directive 70/524 that the Commission has proposed in the White Paper on food safety to present to Parliament before July 2001.	0.7728599001557186
I can also assure Parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account.	0.5707657264203042
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give undue preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted.	0.4623590182079269
The Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations.	0.34456021613957044
I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues.	0.9269138959428721
I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate.	0.6442399695568275
First of all, regarding the observations made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additives in the Additives Directive 70/524, and not in the Novel Feed Directive.	0.8465503438402464
This is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives.	0.5873553522798228
The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998.	0.7153513404565803
But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing.	0.5881396906904793
It is before Parliament for second reading.	0.45278549859254086
It is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90/220 and in particular, Article 11.	0.7664775012865145
Reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies.	0.7758351771273755
Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this.	0.44666551639752605
There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue.	0.9852939159900037
First of all, this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993, so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers.	0.9436101616921314
Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product.	0.40217207829221413
I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives.	0.8615086524033041
Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base, whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152.	0.7739646347443851
I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health.	0.8141465143127571
This is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the European Court of Justice, which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation.	0.8584001793420293
The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this.	0.7638423691610476
As an overall comment to the suggested amendments here, particularly in relation to the legal base issue, it would be inappropriate, in my opinion, to change the legal base to Article 152 in these circumstances, as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the Court.	1.0019333818394836
A number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling.	0.9403233072860032
Directive 70/524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives.	0.37197876664132024
It is already included now: "indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products".	0.7117075242460237
So this issue will be addressed.	0.544653153643798
That formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product, the subject matter of the application.	0.7173235929332428
Mr President, allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question.	0.7244026390200775
First allow me to point out, Commissioner Byrne, that the European Parliament has no right of legislative initiative.	1.078681990238788
But we do reserve the right, when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation, to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out.	0.8934731583287533
Nonetheless, we have confined ourselves in our proposed amendments to bringing the text into line with that of other directives and we have disregarded the question of content.	0.8339988491564273
For example, you did not go into antibiotics.	0.894623099156401
We are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives.	0.7145362806807745
My question, Commissioner Byrne is this: the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade.	0.7033007738659182
Do you really believe that, if we could, Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union?	0.879422373099128
Commissioner Byrne, it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament.	0.7299259411531726
We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years.	0.38573087656750193
I look forward to the next round.	0.8258839400323904
. I would stress that no GMOs have been approved under this directive; it applies only to additives.	0.8723093258409798
I would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue.	0.9164192876343508
It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way, particularly in Directive 90/220.	0.8453818886613224
This issue is before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it, which will also come under the legal base of Article 152 which gives Parliament full competence in the areas of codecision.	0.9679585578464996
I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue.	0.6347541686577232
It is my intention, as it has always been, to work in cooperation with Parliament, to ensure that the results we achieve are the very best results.	1.1633056517706741
The best way of dealing with this issue is through the draft legislation before Parliament at the moment, as well as the legislation in the pipeline, rather than in this technical document and in circumstances where the questions that are set out and to be debated in Directive 90/220 may not be fully taken into account.	0.7603000815282898
It is best to wait for that debate which, I understand, will take place fairly soon.	1.0847867104413969
All of these matters will be addressed in that legislation.	0.7178885172866328
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6002529528362665
Parliament has taken due note of your comments.	0.6182009832871731
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	0.23627004318223602
Scrapie	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0023/2000) by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/68/EC as regards scrapie (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0026/1999 - 1998/0324(COD)).	0.4782429593363792
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was and always will be one of life' s mysteries, one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis, that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep.	0.7837340683654653
In this respect, the Commission' s proposals to amend directive 91/68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the detection and control of TSE infections in general, comply with Parliament' s demands in the wake of the follow-up report by the BSE committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this.	0.6958403183042398
I should, however, like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them BSE-infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is indistinguishable from the symptoms of scrapie.	0.516192151261476
No new knowledge was needed, because the theory from the beginning was that BSE and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold.	0.5980290968247756
From this point of view we are slightly behind the times.	0.5069937270455134
I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission' s proposal on scrapie.	0.8914529718389775
I should, however, like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new TSE regulation allows a reasonable symbiosis between consumer protection and practicable suggestions.	0.7598566558193948
We therefore need to take consistent account of six or seven points in the coming debate on the TSE proposal, and that of course includes scrapie.	0.958640342480107
When we discuss the TSE regulation, Commissioner, we must also clarify that we shortly intend to discuss separate proposals under Article 152 as the corresponding legal base for products excluded from this regulation, such as cosmetics, medicinal products or animal feed.	0.6639949162116401
We insist on this.	0.20619982519238178
As far as I am concerned, that means that fundamental core provisions in this proposed regulation must not be relegated yet again to the Annex but included in the body of the proposed regulation because we here in Parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here.	0.7329628602584417
It also means that, when we are fighting these diseases, the problem of destroying whole herds in the event of an outbreak of scrapie or BSE and the question of defining geographical areas are items which also remain on the agenda.	0.7765926193876275
Although I welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie is included in the TSE regulation, I feel that the Commission' s proposals for fighting scrapie are still not consistent enough and I shall submit amendments on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to tighten up the proposals when the Roth-Behrendt report is debated.	0.8411817933595731
I should also like to address two other points. We expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of Member States as regards outbreaks of scrapie or TSEs.	0.7745159561195641
Here again the Commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by Parliament.	0.8979084752645529
Finally, in discussing the question of the future application of tests, we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reached the point where tests are generally applicable.	1.0067973067320724
But the tests available now are perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy, albeit not for every individual animal.	0.5772736287687226
But when we need to consider if a region can move from a negative epidemiological status to a better category, an epidemiological inspection of the situation in a region in the form of suitable sampling in abattoirs using such tests can provide useful pointers in the political and scientific debate as to where there is a need for preventive consumer protection and, basically, where such tests can be used to help us settle disputes on a proper basis.	0.7830270690621837
I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you would take these passing comments on board in the report on scrapie and in the general report on the fight against TSEs and bear in mind that we shall be calling you to account on these points.	0.9513091441254901
Mr President, over the years, the following situation has arisen: one subject has developed into a subject of many facets.	0.7347727348688259
Many of us here in this House have spent years, whether we intended to or not, dealing solely with the consequences of the BSE scandal right down to the last detail.	0.941690432255232
And it is still on the agenda today.	1.0208149597339797
It is therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr Böge are talking about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report.	0.7645835252665033
The cast is always the same.	0.41317314079517253
Although the cause was unfortunate, it was certainly not the worst experience of this Parliament.	0.8362382219093631
My task as draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee is a very simple one.	0.9635999274538295
I agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the Environment Committee has asked the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to agree to the Commission proposal.	1.088765392422155
That saves a great deal of time which I would like to use for other things and which I shall use now somewhat in anticipation, as Mr Böge has just done.	0.8588990980277249
I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House.	0.5403827584418642
At first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now.	0.37090283550943126
But I have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing.	1.0254357867914716
This debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity, Mr Byrne, to give the Commission a few things to think about.	1.0748809499313954
Although we did not have a very positive exchange on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf' s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree, things may be different with this report.	0.8740846131083517
Allow me to say from the outset that the part of the complex report which Mr Böge dealt with - and this form of collaboration between two committees, with one leading committee and the other giving an opinion and vice versa, worked very well and could perhaps be used as a model for the future - is relatively simple.	0.9033261885037216
It will become more difficult once we see the TSE proposal, Mr Byrne.	0.7904587311974155
When we have the chance to ask direct questions, the questions which Mr Böge referred to will be asked.	0.7986204898124434
Questions will be asked - questions which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries.	0.9920126976812271
How will BSE status in fact be defined then?	0.45888187796147795
Do you envisage circumstances under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test?	0.6460945937652107
And then there is my standing question to you Mr Byrne, a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you. What about the BSE test?	0.8027544457109825
When will you make it compulsory?	0.5175896078508352
Perhaps you will do so before Parliament debates the TSE report.	0.5964672039860736
Not that I want to put it off, but it would be a gesture, as it were, if you could say: here is the proposed legislation on the BSE test.	1.123784239035464
I know that I am a thorn in your side on this, but sometimes that is my job.	0.9643252497220732
I say quite emphatically, even after the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who is completely involved in the whole idea, that animal feeding, animal rearing, animal production must be suited to the species and must also, above all, cause no harm or danger to human beings.	0.7416875796346225
Cosmetic, medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous.	0.5800212300976976
That is, without doubt, too short, too sweet and too little.	0.9142819111289293
You are lucky that Mr Böge' s report only deals with this on the sidelines; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble doing so.	0.6670501880889418
Finally, just one more brief comment, Mr Byrne.	0.9711257622780427
We have a new Commission.	1.0026136030323567
Whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this Commission and the President of the Commission, only time will tell.	0.8132672440503427
But there is one thing we certainly will not let you get away with and I am sure that, as a lawyer and politician you will understand this. Important issues cannot be regulated in annexes.	0.9170754712106838
They belong in the legislative text. I might do the same if I were a Commissioner, because I could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and I would not always need to work with Parliament, which takes so long and is so difficult.	0.9638797889425241
But you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this.	0.6905351887708935
In other words, whenever I get the chance, I shall take everything out of the annexes and cram it into the legislative text.	0.752645505945497
And you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset.	0.7185569120643672
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it is for this chain to provide us with safe, healthy food which is produced, as a matter of principle, without any questionable or risky interim or end products.	0.7174848680666829
Over recent years, these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed.	0.5313154651128712
The European Parliament has already taken a clear stand on BSE and I think that we should do likewise on all epidemics in animals.	0.9603270306063361
We should not allow food safety to be compromised because, in the final analysis, it is our health which is at stake.	0.9096136058752983
The Commission' s proposal encompasses both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goats and a Community regulation to fight scrapie.	0.5563291026117806
This is even more important given that there is no clear proof that BSE and scrapie are unrelated.	0.6844387691953217
Animals are bought throughout Europe and transported over the entire continent.	0.43281234493083276
The spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers.	0.46777638188862414
And I should point out that, for the first time in history, a case of scrapie was detected in Austria about four weeks ago.	0.8661062001453576
Scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the pathogen can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food.	0.42172213550991783
The disease is always fatal.	0.26966377508596184
As there is no vaccination, farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie.	0.6080310454906606
Even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings, the connection with BSE has still not been clarified, as I have already said.	0.8897621092976502
As a farmer myself, I am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk.	0.9010433046938134
I am in favour of preventive measures, starting with feeding which is suitable for the species, rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out.	0.5807614238618085
I therefore welcome the Commission' s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie.	0.8454720709414845
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Böge' s report on measures to prevent TSE diseases is based on the proposals of the European Parliament' s temporary BSE Committee.	0.7810522182833727
Mr Böge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee, and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the BSE Committee in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has fallen to him: he is the one with the experience.	0.855430914778225
I would have liked my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treated the second part of the Commission' s proposal.	0.8655612087283976
I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is featured in the plenary session.	0.6958945369614352
In the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease.	0.4390604114556934
It is indeed.	0.49505484285179696
For me as a Finn, and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals, it is most important that those EU states where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals.	0.8064337318551461
I wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease.	0.6881744498698957
The possibility, if necessary, of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement, as there really is justification for it.	0.8081214049498381
The inspections must be seen as being fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the EU.	0.6493595799872005
On behalf of the European Liberal Democrats, we can support the Commission' s proposal on Mr Böge' s report, but in the forthcoming debate on Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where TSEs do not occur.	1.0569711747212547
Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur.	0.8472804092396921
There is no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field.	0.9272025299086013
It is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important.	1.0291669849620442
Regardless of the many other concerns we may have, BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved.	0.7313680380321278
It is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem.	0.7091089407413351
I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will, I hope, address this situation.	0.8648910693831473
We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future.	0.7432346817747438
No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again.	0.6967495156406869
We have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work.	1.2531879949474576
It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it.	0.8012949002695753
BSE has certainly not gone away.	0.2908089804218628
You can see it in different countries.	0.6494224711155587
I do not want to point the finger at any particular country, but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom.	0.8585614149882111
It will be there for some time to come.	0.9082905396972804
We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability, of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain, is part of that confidence-building mechanism.	0.8543260297050989
If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future.	0.850894278016583
Finally, I have certainly believed for a long time, coming from an agricultural background myself, that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had BSE in the first place.	0.811780603706072
It was never the responsibility of the farmer, it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again.	0.9296753055244754
. Mr President, I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, namely combating TSEs.	0.9954742691345172
I should also like to thank Mr Böge for his work on this issue.	0.766621281245201
Considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation under Article 152 of the Treaty on the prevention and control of TSEs.	0.8838646822278122
This proposal addresses all TSE risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain.	0.45464322394768997
I am here today to listen to your opinions on the first step in this process of establishing a truly comprehensive Community system for the control of these diseases.	0.8011759842840874
I have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing Community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation.	0.6906008563873072
The detailed rules would then follow in that framework proposal.	0.3411613385241088
I have been informed that you welcome this initiative, as appears from your contributions this afternoon, to formulate a single text.	0.7280688580196516
I am looking forward to discussing any further improvements you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation, especially after the reference made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue.	0.6753580701084101
I look forward to receipt of that document, which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue.	0.8562309678158283
Finally, I would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between Parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions, speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation.	0.7282864687591938
In the months I have been Commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system, I can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve, that is, the translation of policy into legislation.	1.0063686968816958
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6002529528362665
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	0.23627004318223602
Community policy in the field of water	0.3902069470042374
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0027/2000) on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	0.6984017992507405
- (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty-first century.	0.5667736686127326
Climate change, global resources, river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future.	0.4009308943361979
We will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet' s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions, the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even, more fundamentally, the global balance.	0.6881974507468623
To support this statement, I would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague, Mário Soares, in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans.	0.9552219547780528
When talking about climate change, we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere.	0.8327950970061856
Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet.	0.5938373761577161
Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent, both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, including its groundwater, surface waters and seas.	0.7500075110277176
Furthermore, Europe has signed international conventions, in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it made certain commitments.	1.0139327521744614
In this it said that in a few years' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances.	0.8104172739014248
Despite having signed these international agreements, this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened.	0.8008040419824126
This is why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy, the European Parliament has since the first reading demanded coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives, particularly with regard to respect for OSPAR. This convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action.	1.0205443097971743
The European Union' s water policy is not starting from zero.	0.6328003054972022
Many directives have already been adopted. Furthermore, the Commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives.	0.8447896687229548
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation.	0.6834055957431086
However, at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made, like OSPAR, but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs.	1.0315830813185285
For despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection, when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved.	0.9927371391589559
In many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts.	0.7275496954983809
We must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us.	0.6621330857637342
Yet we do not have much time.	0.5857327767522441
We could, as the Commission has proposed, accept these overlong deadlines which the Commission and the Council have extended even further. Yet if we do, we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public, but these efforts will be postponed until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be deferred again.	1.104530737869094
It is clear that in this event the objectives will never be achieved.	0.7371470409902017
I am stressing this point because, when disasters are being reported daily in the news, we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that Europe did not act when it should have done. Then, in our haste, we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time.	0.9093072415101815
The current example of the Danube and the pollution from Rumania shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development, clear requirements, controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers, this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time.	0.7551951384377616
It is also clear that if we do nothing, our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner.	1.0162675046078362
Even now, the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism.	0.6435763727401081
To conclude, the issues are clear at this second reading.	0.826976254509382
Do we or do we not want standards compatible with OSPAR, in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero?	0.7163719637783936
Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive?	0.8222764335795728
Do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water?	0.5845099207832796
Do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples?	0.4823972443065614
The majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives. I hope they will be supported by this House.	0.8934125686993304
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us, especially as the very source of life for human beings.	0.7227027620551632
The problem is one of both water quality and water resources, of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe, especially in very dry regions.	0.9418088751782702
I am sorry that Commissioner Wallström, who is responsible in this area, cannot be here now because this is, after all, a very, very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time, and water protection legislation, which we are debating now at second reading, affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join, who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede.	1.0276493624903191
We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994.	0.7110097138741526
A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers.	0.910278204399117
We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77, but another 30 have been added.	0.7073282537350819
You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different.	0.8226530732906564
Some want tighter legislation, some want more clarification, others want to serve national interests.	0.5716333917573496
Even within my group, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there were, of course, differences of opinion.	0.7152283731542957
Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions.	0.5790547077335261
In this sense, the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position.	0.8472831224931077
Some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the European Parliament' s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the Council of Ministers.	0.7860163116197145
We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament' s credibility.	0.525608718499991
For me, that includes the zero demand, i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020.	0.7850690189503535
That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings.	0.3263116116498131
I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and European water protection laws, however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the Member States.	0.8262164450380605
I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted.	0.8653113083596297
That does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money.	0.8056201267440886
Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days.	0.6078069983853994
You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water.	0.6235002304174264
The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too.	0.736552477247434
I am horrified that both Members of Parliament and the public have been misled by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter.	0.634573059717407
I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises.	0.47797373779830643
I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, for all her work and her cooperative attitude, even if we have agreed to differ on certain points.	0.8488574517210803
And I also thank the representatives of the European Commission, who stood by with advice and expert help at all times.	0.7927804458756205
If the representatives of the Council of Ministers take an equally constructive approach, then I have no doubt that together we shall find an even better solution to the problem of water protection in Europe under the conciliation procedure.	0.917644586272695
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work which she has presented and on her efforts in terms of overcoming the differences between us with regard to water.	0.7273844286665329
The framework directive on water is a necessary initiative.	0.7375691488678079
Nevertheless, given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction, this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion.	0.961432442198792
Nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us.	0.6548935382709059
However, in Spain and the other southern countries, which have an unusual climate, the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures.	0.9986408077548753
Therefore, we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and, to this end, I ask that you support Amendment No 95, which has been presented by our group.	1.0498305930378466
We wish to ensure that Article 1 of the directive promotes the sustainable, efficient, fair and considerate use of water.	0.722152215116679
I am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the Spanish Socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here.	0.6669682398237927
One example is water transfers.	0.33385228611993073
We would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to Community supervision.	0.5290590287907172
We consider that, given the hydrological characteristics of Spain, where transfers of a structural nature are carried out, the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources, and these decisions should, of course, always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water.	0.8684257977995076
With regard to one of the most controversial points of our debate, the application of tariffs, the Spanish Socialists have been arguing, in accordance with the principle that the polluter should pay, that the directive should propose policies on accessible prices for all levels of consumption.	0.9198844518607437
In Spain, a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe.	0.8871455927934682
The Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses, owing to the scarcity of water resources and the internalisation of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive.	0.770868916001173
We have therefore always argued for a progressive system of recuperation of costs. This system should take good account of social, environmental and economic effects, and its implementation should be modulated in accordance with differing geographical and climatic conditions.	0.7460633988041085
We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment.	0.765978702551641
However, an environmental Europe cannot, in any circumstances, be built at different speeds, but must be built from a point of view of solidarity.	1.04334151304512
Mr President, the ecological disaster in the Danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of Europe are and how important water is to us all.	0.9741284290385307
Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe.	0.6582734083831255
This brings home the connections which bind us together.	0.2559508283930224
This framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details.	0.7148933472716655
It is important for us to remember that this is a framework.	1.0501049397216198
These brushstrokes are indeed very broad.	0.22903806531433407
It is easy for individual countries, for individual sectors of industry, to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days.	0.859459601588311
There are many opportunities to hide.	0.5825791501117441
The reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in daughter directives in months and years to come.	0.7634187741344932
That is the time to debate some of these problems of detail.	0.9340244503534689
The broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept - the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater, the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals, which we all need in society in all circumstances, should not be finding their way into our water system.	0.8838872530565411
There is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation.	1.0330445944771387
I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing.	0.8735927451993611
This is something that they prefer to avoid doing.	0.7281225419887438
The principle also concerns water charging.	0.25650020284465497
The basic understanding which many of us now share is that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation, to use the carrot-and-stick approach to make best use of our assets so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water.	0.7238722254872834
I want to refer to the political position here.	0.6476599664772353
The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading.	0.6360064247281255
Some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless.	0.7394576829212811
It is a retrograde step.	0.8502537429155438
This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation.	1.0248901751854156
We need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation.	0.7665429378344428
We have seen vote after vote lost.	0.5718193972031334
Measure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee.	0.7865560265260576
We have failed to achieve a qualified majority.	0.6045880814981806
Our attempt to improve the environment of Europe has failed.	0.5384259224256105
We need to get into that conciliation position.	0.6183606611561933
We need, at the end of the day, to ensure that we end up with a sensible, balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost.	0.7398701374418701
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as long as nearly thirty years ago, the European Commission made attempts to draw up a European water policy.	0.8372022519208392
A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated.	0.4122924348154517
Eventually, standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances.	0.4655146649495493
The unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle.	0.4962669629125715
Some seven years ago, it still looked like the European water policy was going to be sacrificed on the altar of subsidiarity.	0.6433611500978297
The conservative government leaders Messrs Major and Kohl decided in a cosy fireside chat at the Edinburgh Summit that it was totally unnecessary for the Spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the Germans or English.	0.5227951942095702
This sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency.	0.5287932610937668
That position is like holey cheese, or to keep it the sphere of water, as leaky as a sieve.	0.7747968486822517
It explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment: nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading.	0.717912981930659
This is unusual, but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes.	0.7369506103753051
The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak.	0.3731054938237701
The chemical industry and, unfortunately, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance.	0.8153720918045081
This is very time-consuming, and, more importantly, there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances.	0.8822545564766442
Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable.	0.4956078367489579
This is what is meant by the term "close-to-zero" .	0.6569013258528505
The Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances, many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect.	0.7665557110989153
These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause, even in extremely minimal quantities, changes in the gender of animals and even humans, as is more and more being ascertained by scientists.	0.7473922526587286
This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020.	0.8315357412875507
I would like to mention two substances from the Commission' s list: mercury and tributyl, abbreviated to TBT.	0.5520145375531015
On the bottom of the Wadden Sea, the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value, to wit, ten and one thousand times, respectively.	0.6067325228651885
The chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes, and if this is impossible, to apply them in closed systems.	0.8470127592577217
For the substance TBT, this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance.	0.9513632467938571
A sound alternative would be to clean the ship' s sides mechanically.	0.5970006867459856
I would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substances by the year 2020.	0.6668854647079244
Mr President, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive.	1.0747982693374607
The Council's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas.	0.6358420806558993
Therefore, our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete.	0.9271968550671379
As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals.	0.6907732152959805
Firstly, we think that the time-frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the Council.	0.9772415122600914
We therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive.	0.9118493260922553
Secondly, I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently.	0.752823312026809
There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented.	0.6163424864653521
The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions, such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected.	0.7545960527460599
Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy.	0.9107973637573219
This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used.	0.905605048757315
Nowadays, taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming.	0.3467935422949007
The obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay, although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases.	0.6093698379865543
Fourthly, we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined.	0.9179306656151611
Fifthly, the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear.	0.647632225224818
Against that background, our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by Mrs Lienemann, the rapporteur, as adopted in committee.	0.9596561255469656
We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended.	0.897973275195433
We will therefore vote for the Greens' Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position.	0.833132586280954
As regards pricing policy, there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report.	0.6615137992388737
My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43, tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens' Amendment No 105.	0.8020729364695918
I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned.	0.5506840017259925
However, some people in our political group think otherwise.	0.8168719048806493
Consequently, Amendment No 107, on the same question, has been tabled by one section of our group only.	1.0398654076624378
On the whole, I welcome the committee's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise.	0.7321119334574144
Mr President, every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet, yet the abundance of water is an illusion.	0.7927020243257241
The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders.	0.5668873597541689
Water is a renewable but limited natural resource.	0.3314079051841972
It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable.	0.541525194604885
In the EU, this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas.	0.9904786075562336
The increase in vulnerable areas, both wet and dry, inequalities between countries, inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic, economic, geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need. However, these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community.	0.6819842518479825
We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land.	0.8716810609945298
Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive.	0.8447780149865547
It is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought. Last October in Turin, the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean.	0.8778715666136077
We are not, fortunately, at this point.	1.0063831288099143
However, we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods, which the directive underlines.	1.012222085992234
For example, France, the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding.	0.6055571408678584
We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other.	0.7667050629725165
Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water.	0.6830318721940739
The water issue will definitely not be settled today.	0.47590610379558945
In fact, the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects.	0.8457413138841411
Mr President, it is very likely that, during this century, good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil.	0.941468360432615
This is enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water.	0.6589894428324724
It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework.	0.31831147791360487
With the framework directive on water policy, we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the EU' s water legislation.	0.7971077566041948
But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies.	0.6593466419717234
More specifically, the possibilities for adopting a specific policy by Member States and water boards, which have been set up thanks to the catchment basin approach, need to be maximised.	0.8290528714920725
The key goals remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water, the protection of eco systems, the promotion of the sustainable use of water, the control of floods and droughts and the termination of discharging dangerous substances into surface water.	0.6868605863138858
As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned, I am of the opinion that the Councils' objectives lack both commitment and ambition.	0.6968658253214873
The Committee on the Environment' s present proposal to reduce discharges to close-to-zero is, in my view, to be welcomed and worthy of emulation.	0.9580771980139017
However, a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability.	0.7841846871768415
Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced, as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control, and which pollute the water quite substantially.	0.7342564683616436
Mr President, we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect.	0.938482633270007
In the 20th century, water was merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substances, special waste, chemicals and so on. And we can already see the consequences!	0.7614505494981152
We need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation.	0.586026680832025
The directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the Commission is planning here.	0.7501245615971435
In the final analysis, water protection is not just a social question, it is a decisive social question, which is why the polluter pays principle must be applied more rigorously as otherwise we all bear the consequences.	0.8853932678343235
Given the advanced state of pollution of water resources, it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements.	0.8026313563292429
Mr President, it must be some six years ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, assisted by Mrs Ursula Schleicher, put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety.	0.7254949965628443
It is not an easy topic and, in my opinion, the efforts made by Mrs Lienemann are very laudable indeed.	1.0290324864802216
The decision-making process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage.	0.6973218053188982
The topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result, we have been able to draft important, more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading.	0.809420756179557
In fact, the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal.	0.7647842660808724
It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge.	0.8977436580130421
I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect: in the North of Europe, we often face floods, but also polluted water, from industry, whilst the problem facing the Members in the South is often related to transporting water over long distances, simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture.	0.9255270308322427
I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail.	0.5968408137588561
I would first of all like to focus on quality.	0.5599460749607318
The Netherlands is significantly affected by the European water policy.	0.7796241834888359
A very important component, to wit, one third of our drinking water, is extracted from surface water in the Netherlands.	0.9412431346861106
The Netherlands is located downstream, in a delta, which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance.	0.8604832359233527
Another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality.	0.5334433005692656
In a number of amendments, the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question.	0.6692277538151166
Although I understand that, according to some, this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially, I do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure.	0.9931303248309339
I would now like to say a few words on quantity management.	0.5502286725372956
In his poem "Herinneringen aan Holland" [ "Reminiscing about Holland" ], a famous Dutch poet mentioned water too, which, with its never-ending trail of destruction, was feared and respected.	0.8258564882005169
In 1953, we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology.	0.7171355287206649
When our rivers flooded in 1990, we established that installing artificial works upstream affects the water-storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage.	0.5345685726609739
This means that in terms of quantity management too, we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it.	0.7166003673618748
Mr President, I too would like to start by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work.	0.7012680687865611
Water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right.	0.8758576676291189
Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident, as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too.	0.8955180803840563
Water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples.	0.5453421330917224
This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination.	0.7176698581507186
We need to recognise that water is a joint liability.	0.8629780628458917
Cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident.	0.3636209728750152
Too little operational capacity upstream or, in fact, excessive use, can cause problems downstream.	0.703740764197164
Coordination is the key word here.	0.5439755580240252
The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical.	0.8597044249407377
Changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation.	0.45477174764705086
Some areas are becoming drier, whilst many are becoming wetter.	0.5164244045079388
It is time for action.	0.7176079578519182
In March, the Second World Water Forum will be held in The Hague.	0.9028583961814498
This Forum stands for a worldwide vision.	0.2803109829531903
This vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control.	0.4357942521814595
The time for action is upon us.	0.597535537122674
The European Parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time.	0.7463789534121344
But we should not lower our standards too much either.	0.5971320402833179
The common position is not ambitious enough.	0.7620065284541582
This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements, or the OSPAR objectives.	0.9119168296452426
We need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020.	0.5642780205963799
This has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too.	0.7584074112307545
The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up.	0.6191265990996511
A list has been compiled, containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment.	0.48381868467753875
It is both technically and economically possible to reduce the emission of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again.	0.5923694376286344
Needless to say, the directive also needs to be binding.	0.7254783961276616
Countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives.	0.4377861845276579
Quality has a price, but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future.	0.6654093187028145
Mr President, Commissioner, my compliments to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive.	0.7332761396486112
I should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change, the depletion of primeval forests and overfishing, constantly affect our common and vital but, in some ways, unowned resources.	0.7712772630508542
We should also recognise that, in Europe, our fresh water sources may be said to be on the borderline between being owned by everyone and by no-one.	0.7858794075414227
It is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established.	0.6593854470426809
It is also important for the different watercourses to be kept together and managed as the totality they in fact are, irrespective of who owns one section or another of a common watercourse.	0.7022560641428927
Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive does indeed, as many speakers have already said, represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the jumble of piecemeal EU regulations and directives and achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe.	0.8146444489957555
However, I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation.	0.9831558891809915
I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental points.	0.8730466997306859
First OSPAR.	-0.0
We know that the Commission proposal does not go far enough; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment.	1.0049302348206908
Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough.	0.5487912104339447
What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR.	0.7086139233060945
Only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and, more importantly, objectives which are enforceable under the law.	0.6615627767815765
Anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters, such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary, from happening to us.	0.7596827132402518
I find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection, despite having agreed internationally on OSPAR.	0.6619037469159431
But I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament, in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised.	1.1388676694684465
It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth.	0.6425916996681487
We must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry lobbyists; on the contrary, we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and, hence, cost-covering prices.	0.8478949505452045
Water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the OSPAR convention.	0.6918293291847328
With closed production circuits this is possible; anything else would water down the directive.	0.4265629657876129
Let us grab our chance.	0.16207050620757765
Mr President, in the small amount of time allotted to me, I would like to welcome the Mrs Lienemann' s report and remind the House of three principles, to which all other principles must be subordinate, which are clearly expressed in the rapporteur' s amendments: water is not a commercial product, but the property of all the peoples of the Union; the ultimate objective is to eliminate all pollutants in surface water and groundwater, and to inform the public so that it can participate in the recuperation of water and not use water excessively given that it is such a precious commodity.	1.023421935219833
I know that this directive may have problems, given the differing situations of the various countries of the Union, as has already been mentioned.	1.0688371011824842
The situation in the north is different from that in the south, and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas.	1.1356081983275095
I understand this.	0.328041293612726
However, there are some amendments which attempt to help the countries of the south, specifically Amendment No 43 which, with regard to the recuperation of costs, also indicates that Member States must take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when it comes to decision making.	0.9820670182417558
There are also difficulties with the issue of transfers.	0.6604942621663831
In my country - I live in the north of Spain -, there is a considerable difference between the north and the south, and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another.	0.9599657108668191
However, Mrs Lienemann' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water.	0.7241122934750795
I know that this is a difficult report and that the differing situations of countries cause difficulties, but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what is happening on the Danube and what happened in Doñana.	1.0242764306858871
We cannot allow our European water to be polluted, Mr President, and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water, which is so precious to all of us.	0.9607762496088518
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report.	0.9091373058746129
As an Irish Member of the European Parliament, coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water, I support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive.	0.9174337765790843
However, I would now like to look at the areas of difference between Parliament's Committee on the Environment and the Council.	0.9917138293103249
The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter.	0.5903406137854895
According to the Council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force, whereas Parliament's Committee on the Environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years.	0.7683386771919835
I see no reason why European Union Member States cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible.	0.7266546665457025
I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage.	0.7492173152522916
The Council in its common position states that the European Union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage.	0.8028899995864337
No specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position.	0.7096013204937863
Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in Europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently.	0.6565696280502736
Moreover, an adequate contribution from different economic sectors, broken down into industrial, household and agricultural sectors, must ensure that this policy is implemented.	0.7203032259582846
Unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that metering and water rates should be implemented for households right across the European Union states.	0.6378297723016664
This is politically impractical from an Irish perspective, as indeed it would be from the perspective of other EU Member States such as Portugal, Greece and Spain.	0.7080376550670523
Mr President, I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report.	0.9571820597600045
It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come.	0.8939370803791707
We can do this by, as a Parliament, amending the Council' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment.	0.8861443045539651
In its unaltered form, the present directive could, in fact, have very unfortunate and long-term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water.	0.9524671047274662
It would be to send out the wrong signals both to European industry and to the European people.	1.078556449680665
It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters.	0.5674111757056968
The directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100,000 chemicals in circulation.	0.533959248119303
We cannot afford to wait.	0.3526775810604028
In this connection, I would ask Parliament to support Amendment No 108, in which the words "water pollution caused by individual pollutants" are replaced by "prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges" .	0.7623813499163243
We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment.	0.42644754726929085
The EU' s Ministers for the Environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the OSPAR Convention, which now already defines what is hazardous to the environment.	0.7285668890698934
This Convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and, not least, to our descendants.	0.8657122829800495
Mr President, it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive.	0.737625392892437
The Treaty of Amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention, for the implementation of the 'polluter pays' principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment.	0.7261674950808459
Clearly, the importance of recognising the economic value of ecological factors in setting prices and making operators accountable through the adoption of incentives for non-polluting systems, seems unquestionable in the light of events that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage, particularly our water resources.	0.6661207698048436
This situation is loudly echoed in many sectors of the economy, and especially in the agricultural sector.	0.90512282196667
The concept of good agricultural practice has been introduced in amongst the complexity of the current relationships between agriculture, environment and water resources, and between positive and negative effects, and amongst the wide range of local realities and production systems and so on. This concept indicates which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the Community expectation of an environmental protection of water resources that surpasses basic standards, along with the subsequent costs and reductions in income.	0.7278366378667307
The obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration derives from this notion, with the aim of keeping the management of water resources at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of current conditions.	0.7129680576824325
We must not, with this in mind, pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting, improving and restoring their quality, as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques.	0.7908437054214276
As regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment, an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community levels, which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities.	0.6805863330141144
Finally, we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances, using the increased information available on their chemical, physical and biological properties, in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage, which is fundamental to us all.	0.7918584791864891
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam seriously, then our long-term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption.	0.8200123659756952
We can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards.	0.6237729657094935
In this respect, I fully support the amendments proposed by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that, when people use water, they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks.	0.8866080225735468
This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting.	0.43166232765806595
First there is wide information for and involvement by the public, a rarity in a European directive.	0.712612986701885
Secondly, there is compulsory cooperation.	0.7268017960704707
I am glad a holistic approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality.	0.955002996282184
Thirdly, I should like to address the question of the timetable.	0.9580289247423993
I am firmly convinced that we need a strict, tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective.	0.7976571604660335
Compare it with what happens in December.	0.5749394200668846
We all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents.	0.49571357525510595
But what would we do if we knew in December that Christmas was in thirty years' time.	0.48081933067393795
We all know what we would do, which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy.	1.0893512202319509
I emphatically support the rapporteur' s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive, from the list of measures to the question of employment measures.	0.9421176924800948
Mr President, the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the Member States work together to protect groundwater, drinking water and surface water and that the level of protection corresponds to existing EU environmental legislation.	0.8546013406096749
May I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the Nitrates Directive have still not been implemented in all Member States, in spite of the fact that there is a common EU resolution.	0.7624441341997855
The present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives.	0.6027577600002437
It is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced synthetic substances.	0.5409464942062286
This cannot be done, and it also, in any case, goes against nature.	1.0175420191640845
Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment.	0.6379658977536716
European agriculture would not, for example, be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread.	0.7841367802744076
As a result, agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU, with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs.	0.7024514058698045
I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs.	0.5472381270030449
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is a precious raw material.	0.5968521622429735
Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal.	0.8627801501704377
It should, therefore, not surprise us that water is the cause of wars.	0.7225890219658138
The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs.	0.4077134518948533
General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation.	0.49607212510978044
Europe is therefore facing an arduous task; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation.	0.6161911536695376
I have to admit that in Flanders, where I come from, we still have a long way to go too.	1.0361053107639229
We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter.	0.6247648924823945
Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way.	0.7395056741603503
The common position is in this respect a farce, a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements.	0.8101532890321997
The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years.	0.4917391580027151
By then, my children will be older than I am now.	0.697418995675678
You have to admit: this is a joke.	0.9725591120622852
Tomorrow, we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children.	0.793228239084252
Either we opt for the amendments of my group, of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment.	0.8923219527990192
I would like to finish off with this observation.	0.48194619443187614
In the past couple of months, we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium.	0.8628158259785516
What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers.	0.5613094548469932
In our own country, this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations.	0.626738573868416
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament' s more drastic positioning.	0.6541479706141139
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware.	0.8699227888091902
Ladies and gentlemen, fine words are no longer sufficient.	0.5050285360571929
We need to change tack completely.	0.4787760527125457
During the vote tomorrow, we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy.	0.916950433985523
This can only benefit our credibility.	0.49305037590731915
The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.	0.4826749108787872
The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform	0.37265515563276097
The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform: the issues at stake.	0.9492567772356175
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today. I am basically here to speak to you, as indicated by your agenda, on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform.	1.0324910289136426
This reform must involve all the actors in European construction, with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner, the Council ministers and national MPs. It must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European construction.	0.8603219375194585
This morning, in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi, many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions.	1.010134498592161
Yet it is not just a question of who does what, as one of you said very clearly and forcefully.	0.9969126883995082
Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do.	0.7954074152753426
We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future, particularly with the countries which will be joining us.	1.174612435842753
We too are concerned about this lack of democracy, and the Commission has therefore decided to launch the 'Dialogue on Europe' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people. This initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.0076329083096915
During the IGC I will have the honour of representing the Commission together with Mr Prodi and of working closely with your two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos. All the Commissioners have undertaken to use some of their time when they go to any country or region, and not just their own, which in my case happens three or four times a month, to engage in direct dialogue with the public, and not just with the élite or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course.	0.8935653577804091
We also plan to establish direct contacts in universities, schools and factories, to meet the people, answer their questions and listen to them. In this way we will play our part, as will you, in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do.	0.8792355238039687
We hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament.	0.8765561827751485
We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work.	0.6264404283905172
We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organisations, socio-professional organisations and the media.	0.5873145050603114
Opinion multipliers, political groups and parties, MEPs and national MPs, elected representatives, as I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved.	0.8531711436104907
Need I remind you that the European Parliament itself took the initiative on 1 February? I must again thank Mr Napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are, of course, the representatives of the people in each Member State.	0.896871801463477
The Commission will propose that the Member States become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership.	0.742356990492106
We are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the European Union Presidency and the European Parliament.	0.8994467190707163
I have indicated the conditions under which the Commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits.	0.4677911208319043
We want to encourage debate among the people.	0.4956644425511322
Without presuming to lecture you - God forbid - or even advise you, may I just point out that, when it was my honour to be Minister for European Affairs in my own country, I saw the need to establish a direct dialogue with the people? Each week, when engaging in this dialogue in each region, I realised that there was a real need for the European Union to have a face.	1.015884679778623
I therefore took a European Commissioner, and not just the French ones, or ambassadors posted in Paris or MEPs to engage in this dialogue each week. This made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected, listened to and informed.	0.818616172021224
So this is what we are going to do.	0.8486968695860535
We will have a budget of approximately EUR 4 million for 2000 which you will hopefully approve.	0.8374721015661355
Financing from the 2001 budget must also be negotiated as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both 2000 and 2001. It will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the Intergovernmental Conference and the ratification process.	0.7965395501188134
We will launch this dialogue on 8 March in Brussels in the presence of 700 young Commission stagiaires.	0.46834958718155234
Your President, Mrs Fontaine, has agreed to take part with Mr Prodi and several Commissioners in this initial dialogue. I can assure you that, whenever a Commissioner intends to engage in dialogue, the most immediately available MEPs will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the European Parliament.	0.9774157881951068
That is all I have to say for the moment.	1.0179497307773724
I welcome any questions, suggestions or proposals from the Members present.	0.4089763430103379
Colleagues, you know the rules.	0.9053984975912657
You are expected to ask questions, not necessarily make lengthy statements.	0.7831820447963297
You have one minute each in which to ask your question.	0.547698069513525
Mr President, I think I also speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that I chair, in expressing my appreciation of this Commission initiative.	0.97204681176144
Moreover, this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November.	0.941511502025001
I have also heard Commissioner Barnier' s clarification of relations and links with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme.	0.7947293644216767
If I may make a suggestion, Commissioner Barnier, would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject, in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the European Parliament?	0.9664934396027108
It would be helpful to stress this convergence of intentions and efforts because I can see a particular problem with coordination, specifically between the Commission initiative - which certainly does not only address members of national parliaments, but also members of national parliaments - and our committee' s programme. Following the working meeting of 1 February, which Commissioner Barnier referred to and which benefited from the weighty contribution of the Commission, the committee intends to take stock of developments at the Intergovernmental Conference at all of its meetings.	0.9390556072241912
We therefore hope to benefit from the capable and consistent participation of members of national parliaments at all of our meetings, and this will be a channel which will ably supplement the ones in the Commission' s initiative.	0.8791186339951332
Thank you, Mr Napolitano.	0.7630598247463369
I can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of 18 November.	0.8122127551780259
I also want at this stage to say that I was able to propose this initiative to the Commission thanks to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague, Viviane Reding. This initiative was also established in conjunction with Günter Verheugen as it involves all the major challenges of enlargement, both its opportunities and risks, and of institutional reform.	0.9506632737330493
These challenges must be explained to our citizens who are concerned about them and questioning them.	0.6459835772668336
I understand your concern, Mr Napolitano, and an interinstitutional working group will be set up. Its first meeting should take place in March.	1.0878670952144596
I will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the Commission' s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other. I will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint.	0.8810573565115516
You realise that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned.	0.5284081009852255
Mr President, Commissioner, it is music to my ears to hear you use the word 'citizen' so often.	0.5315352681075445
We are increasingly concerned in this House about public opinion. The fear of public opinion is a rather paternalistic concept but our House is what it is and we must do what we can with it.	0.9291388264797121
In terms of the IGC issue, I have a specific question for you. I believe that the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and OLAF.	1.0634800764717538
As you know, there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens.	0.6995853586953388
Given the urgency surrounding this issue, has the Commission considered the possibility of completely changing the structure of the anti-fraud office by moving to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud, in the Member States and in the European institutions, coming under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice?	0.847866579223449
Mr Dupuis, first of all I attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word 'citizen' .	0.5993927058344692
It is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used.	0.8616083061025318
We will conduct this dialogue with our citizens, including the most disadvantaged and those isolated from decision-making or information centres.	0.7235020315128626
With regard to the IGC and this issue of the fight against fraud, and specifically fraud against the Community budget and interests, we have retained the idea in our proposals of creating a new and specific post of a European public prosecutor. We have done this in the spirit of this House' s work and perhaps by going down the same road.	1.0474823462638847
This public prosecutor would have the authority, recognised by the EU Treaty and therefore by the Member States, to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the Community budget and interests.	0.7664561696389407
We can clearly and almost clinically see that legal cooperation is now no longer enough to fight against this fraud whether it originates from inside or outside the Community. This is why we have proposed the creation of a European public prosecutor who could, having investigated a case from start to finish, then have this investigated and ruled on by the most appropriate national court.	0.7660387628090044
In reply to your second point on the Court of Justice, we have not yet established our position on the Court of Justice because we were waiting for the Dur report which was published a few days ago.	0.8078798509437722
The Commission, as I have promised, will complete its proposals on the IGC opinion about the legal system and the Court of Justice within the next few weeks.	1.000297503032292
Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the day before yesterday, there was a leading news item in the most popular Danish news programme, which I would ask you to comment on.	1.1148790334302792
The story went that an official in the Commission had apparently told an Austrian businessman that, because he was Austrian, he would possibly be excluded from being able to participate in a scientific development project together with businesses in other countries, including Denmark.	0.8116024776076294
I would ask you to confirm that, if an official has said that an Austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects, then this official has got the wrong end of the stick, and that, if he has not said this, then there is no story.	0.982719166977789
Will you confirm what is the case?	0.8856002930102733
Mr Haarder, to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing.	0.7042038010561885
My personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the Austrian people, businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in Austria of a new government coalition.	0.766487985586268
Therefore, subject to verification which I or someone else will give immediately after this sitting, I can confirm what you have just said, that the Commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort.	0.8333017009824556
Generally speaking, there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in Austria. I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957.	0.9301362296107419
This is an economic community, of course, but it is also, primarily, a community of values.	1.0720768272980565
This is why we are drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis. This is why we have Article 13 of the EC Treaty on discrimination which we proposed, in our opinion of 26 January even before the Austrian crisis, should be applied after the IGC by qualified majority rather than by unanimity.	0.8150285828879051
This is why I personally have an idea to supplement Article 7 of the EU Treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis. Finally, this is why we have public debate.	0.9129002553319192
The only way to eliminate misconceived ideas is to offer alternatives, which brings me back to the subject of our discussion. I firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate, particularly to fight against demagoguery.	0.8812162611453224
Commissioner Barnier, you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe.	0.7580450895768732
With reference to the IGC, as you know, under the Helsinki decisions the Portuguese Presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC.	0.86373505838093
Clearly, Parliament has its own representatives present, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos.	0.8381000260209337
But would you, Commissioner, also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the Council you would report this to Parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you, with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress?	0.8835055789876315
Mr Beazley, my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise.	0.6657814553016788
Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and many other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and even more MEPs in this House know that, on behalf of the Commission, I will be available to tell you how things are going as they happen throughout these negotiations, in a spirit of transparency.	1.0277749996853662
I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that, in many cases, we will say this together.	0.8577040337552856
It is very important that these negotiations is not secretive with the European Parliament or the national parliaments which, when all said and done, will have their opinions to give and their positions to take in the ratification process.	0.9523887979040834
This is why I congratulate Mr Napolitano' s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the Fifteen and the European Parliament.	0.8946391255678032
Having said that, the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions.	0.7827895686440975
I will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year.	0.7926957740866462
Mr President, firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach.	0.8602499090692485
I think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage. This did not really happen for the Treaty of Amsterdam or the Treaty of Maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust.	0.8551581067612398
I have two questions. Firstly, you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission.	0.9656507784547035
Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well, that is to say via the television and Internet?	0.6614288566378478
My second question is of a critical nature.	0.6619338466982374
The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency.	0.9580912197706621
If I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands, then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model, and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands.	0.8181060702294435
My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this.	0.9128288204756042
Mrs Maij-Weggen, given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC, it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now.	0.7779422345460102
The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible.	0.709886484543061
The documents will in the main be open working documents.	0.5433263688089895
Although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media, I am committed, as I must be at this stage, to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission' s viewpoint.	1.0307493316491387
I can confirm, and thank you for having asked me about this, that we will use all the most modern means, television in particular, to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe.	0.8943678448858168
We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums.	0.31456655526223604
The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised.	0.4978558597336467
These are the modern means to be used.	0.8760646007353707
However, I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people.	1.1682229217941102
Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal, I want a Commissioner, when he can, an MEP, a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe.	1.0733476431108195
I have evidence that this is possible.	0.7021724629335417
The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions.	0.4178580354523303
Although this may seem rather egotistical, I want the Commission, in the minds of the people, to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible.	1.066074229962509
Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say.	0.9420618459719371
I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire, a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding.	0.7761146926719551
He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner.	0.4324092228345232
I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign?	1.0273854147802792
In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be.	0.9000719112219756
That is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist.	0.7719200622822889
The Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign.	0.8789449364970638
Mr Corbett, thank you for your comments.	0.517166323447215
I willingly accept your invitation. If I have understood you correctly, you want me, when I come to Yorkshire, to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds.	1.034670879478773
I can perform this dual task.	0.25247870953775803
I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments, as I have already done, not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ.	0.8774576667002623
Ten days ago I was in Westminster, so you can see, Mr Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties.	1.127255022510391
Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin.	0.5219997396205162
I have already appeared before the French Senate.	0.6491739984791064
Therefore, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will go directly to see the national parliaments too.	1.0344543536928514
With regard to the dialogue with our citizens, it is not a question of propaganda or marketing, nor even of communication.	0.8869188949503464
I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue. So, after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform, those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion.	0.8697524712501047
I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States. I sincerely hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate.	0.9810206535949244
Mr President, I should like to join Mr Barnier' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with.	0.7087220683703829
It is not much fun, of course, having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself.	0.7474232424478374
In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier said, during his presentation in Parliament, that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but, when I look at page 63, I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say, the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination, the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and, with a few exceptions, of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting.	1.0654683228297015
Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States' election processes?	0.5605196823018366
It is, of course, these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments.	0.657833678519264
Can such matters be controlled from Brussels?	0.250352389050811
Is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning?	0.49678138068170435
I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference, not merely to relations between the Union and Member States, but also the Union, the Member States, regions and cities.	0.9608302397785363
I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe, Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears.	0.7627796605077348
Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms.	0.8743487874902295
Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this type, form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki?	0.84300170631123
I do not think so.	0.628295405983
Are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion, unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking?	0.4633782014856965
Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission.	1.0029416442383685
I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated.	0.8949463803471234
In terms of social protection, I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology.	0.8666295102399834
In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people.	0.84828340933502
This will therefore be our rule.	0.5470497132544343
We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic.	0.8245592731341478
I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues.	0.6417841011686978
I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical.	0.9360551392534091
This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27.	0.9807147908258648
Mr MacCormick, I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals.	0.8297026376930846
It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots.	0.8393724608996912
If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity.	0.925368351109641
We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions.	0.7041867017822847
Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this.	0.8664224228765589
It specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam.	0.7823009424092887
It also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies.	0.6337312080992114
The Commission is acting correctly if, on a particular point, it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions. I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7.	1.0640390620801259
However, if we do, this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the Union must mobilise together to give their response. We will also do this with regard for the future in general.	1.056634626684843
We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War.	0.9272344914704735
Everything which can be done will be useful. I am sure that you and I, Mr Berthu, can at least agree on this.	0.993577561356886
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6002529528362665
You have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to.	0.41305780452834984
You have set a very good example of time-keeping today.	0.7293177763899903
That concludes the debate.	0.1437775861795048
Question Time (Commission)	0.24375550524597958
The next item is Question Time (B5-0009/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	0.8070246634085795
First part	-0.0
Question No 36 by (H-0025/00):	0.19170796359300946
Subject: High infant mortality in Kosovo According to the latest UN data received from the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe; almost 50% of babies born prematurely die, while the war has produced a steep rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm.	0.5778015631354259
In the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the Union and the efforts of its envoy Bernard Kouchner, will the Commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of Kosovo's right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women, women in childbirth and babies?	0.8571918051376777
Mr President, the Commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in Kosovo, not just for pregnant women but across the board.	0.9026443166971125
This results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it.	0.45922699635424635
The statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable.	0.4827980020916707
However, the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population.	1.0155763227257744
The Commission' s response has been as follows: firstly, the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of ECHO funding.	0.6604053033746913
ECHO is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care, on support to institutions as well as vaccination.	0.6088790588656883
However, efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province.	0.6079404252743945
UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field.	0.6713859369774557
Secondly, under the reconstruction programme, urgent intervention at the hospital in Mitrovica has already been initiated with a EUR 1 million rehabilitation programme.	0.6354679203789045
Progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city.	0.5486495097852757
However, the Commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of UNMIK for this project.	0.9073985061508262
We hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation.	0.6200627095405444
Under the European Community' s damage assessment, estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million.	0.5701526405653833
The Commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds.	0.8316465405024102
We expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system.	0.43186342191374094
The emphasis will be on long-term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement.	0.5139742956750633
Work is already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise.	0.7282645203090512
Commissioner, this morning President Prodi, among others, stressed that the Balkans are testing our ability to act effectively, the very credibility of the European Union is on trial, and the gap between words and deeds must finally be closed.	0.9354094027303141
Commissioner, do you really think that the facts we have about high infant mortality in Kosovo - the highest in Europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevails in Kosovo, are not already damaging our credibility and casting doubt on our ability to live up to our promises?	0.7800616876147408
Besides, Commissioner, is so-called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in Kosovo?	0.6791198374960481
Do you think that so much inaction is excusable when, on the continent of Europe itself, the right to life is at risk?	0.764650528509912
I do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it, which have been working incredibly hard in Kosovo, would regard it as an adequate description of their labours to suggest that they had been standing idly by.	0.8131531964356775
I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that.	0.8118669101376337
Of course, she is entirely correct in saying that the Union' s credibility is on the line with what happens, not just in Kosovo but in the Balkans as a whole.	0.9542597997607739
I am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance.	0.778651872346373
I would just make two points about the situation in Kosovo which we are addressing as enthusiastically as we can along WHO lines.	0.8423125945066605
First of all, I am sure that the honourable Member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in Belgrade underfunded the health service in Kosovo, and many Albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all.	0.8523269690277412
As a result of that, a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society.	0.6754010723157141
So what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under-investment.	0.7515159312339629
Secondly, and I am sure that the honourable Member recognises this as well, some of the tragic stories to come out of Kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child mortalities during carriage of a baby, but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born.	0.7913579362224282
Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities, or before the hostilities, tragically killed their own children.	0.6054391485648721
We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo.	0.3706003621227724
We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour, but it is not going to be easy.	0.8551069958943475
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your response to the Member' s first question and the supplementary question.	0.9190847401138732
However, I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO, among others, are often of inferior quality.	0.651931222358555
In some cases, there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like.	0.5678457753084514
Are you aware of this?	0.4794511006815154
Are you prepared to act upon it?	0.3859942567670086
This is my first additional question.	0.6163404370961417
My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica.	0.5801986429574626
You are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the Northern part of the city and that, given the tense situation, Albanian Kosovars do not have any access to this section at all.	0.7345817375991164
What does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital?	0.6700408225299552
On the first question, I am going myself to Kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and I will certainly look into the allegation made by the honourable Member about the ECHO food package.	0.8105789548364439
I have not heard that suggestion before, but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there.	1.032416175094706
Secondly, I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica.	0.843188103013683
I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago, I saw the situation there for myself.	0.9037039653241454
I had discussions with municipal leaders from both communities, including the leader of the Albanian side who had himself in the past been a doctor and was generally recognised for the medical work he had done during the hostilities and subsequently.	0.5939064975115683
So I know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in Kosovo, whatever ethnic group they come from.	0.9187957855467643
The particular difficulties in Mitrovica - for example, it is not just a question of Albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital, Albanian staff have had difficulty working there - are particularly acute problems.	0.7165486559885319
We will try to address them, but it is not easy.	0.8777029538485266
Question No 37 by (H-0029/00):	0.21243904567250782
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Commission taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	0.6320618591128696
The Commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries.	0.7265480628446692
In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.	0.6397837932784606
Mr President, the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union.	1.0914673186721318
Will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because, in the final analysis, we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the European Union?	0.7767169650476776
My question therefore is this: will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions?	0.770793070811622
The key issue is to support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk group to find a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can.	0.7042125893907627
We have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia.	0.615536796801176
Let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union.	0.5200211545643465
The situation of Turkey's relations with its neighbours will, as the honourable Member asks, be closely examined in the framework of the pre-accession strategy.	0.8295241101701625
As stated in Agenda 2000 - and I quote: "Enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts".	0.7136503382634374
That statement could not be much clearer.	0.49900279289701155
But I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results.	0.901785055361813
Question No 38 by (H-0040/00):	0.18059097139939853
Subject: Implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey Given that Turkey has recently been granted applicant country status, what is the Commission's view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam, given the massive displacement of the Kurdish and the other people of the region that will result?	0.8515888465382411
The Commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the region.	0.8681642148596859
We will, however, consider raising the matter with the Turkish authorities, together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey.	0.7624922864264277
I have a related point.	0.6323864629843077
It concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole.	0.7657802290817803
As you know, the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to Syria and to Iraq in particular.	0.5673412870579262
Given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many commentators that we will see an increased incidence of conflict, of so-called "water wars", in the coming decades, what is the Commission's view about the potential destabilisation, both in Turkey and in the wider region, that will be caused by this dam?	0.9829665593181551
Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well?	0.5580222374063054
We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member.	0.6271693818064802
We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up.	0.7686976774469008
There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area.	0.6061037896719395
We will raise that, too, in the representations we make.	0.7028053315568812
A number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern, such as the effect on displaced farmers.	0.5876727558090699
On the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the Commission is participating in any form.	1.0778927291669322
Question No 39 by (H-0036/00):	0.15202025173930217
Subject: Drafting of Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	0.7677386175042273
What are the Commission's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	0.6253031131539553
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)	0.632327137417867
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	0.578362028317698
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	0.4518176650195623
What are the Commission's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	0.6617771681631979
Like the honourable Member, the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government to start the process of drawing up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In the conclusions of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even established the broad outlines of the Charter' s content.	0.7928131894933858
According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights. The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.	0.9133506314283387
The second is the rights reserved for citizens of the European Union. The third is economic and social rights, as contained in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the Union.	1.0150586902580812
The Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given by the Cologne European Council.	0.6915572636658899
Having said that, this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources.	0.7068551228734187
As I have said before in this House, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances, particularly technological and social changes.	1.0420680137424847
However, given the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submitted to the Heads of State and Government, this power must be exercised with caution and on a case-by-case basis.	0.7532499327923189
The rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary.	0.5295513842821132
Some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union.	0.629431075749623
It may also be envisaged that some economic and social rights could be guaranteed only for citizens of the European Union and third-country nationals meeting certain conditions.	0.7644682876809782
