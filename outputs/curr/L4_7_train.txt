The present consensus paper recommends diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in HIVE and HIVM and outlines the current research.	0.4474304310929499
Background: Prognostic data heart failure rely on epidemiological studies or large clinical trials.	0.40333165823622247
These data are not to transfer easily on everyday practice.	0.530854278509151
Forty-nine patients (mean age, 54 years) admitted for displaced ankle fractures were observed retrospectively to determine by clinical examination and measurement of plantar pressure distribution whether successful surgical treatment of ankle fractures had led to gait symmetry.	0.7184232155236066
The mean follow-up was 36 months (range, 19-54 months).	0.647718666276784
The deviation in gait was quantified using peak pressure.	0.2438656251166292
Using a clinical score, most of the patients had satisfactory results.	0.9403107909274268
The plantar pressure distribution showed significant load asymmetries of patients with satisfactory results and those with non-satisfactory results.	0.5097683534584108
Dynamic gait analysis allows quantification of gait asymmetry and clinically non-visible gait disorder.	0.32092761174689566
Comparison of radiation exposure applied by different types of CT scanners for the investigation of the chest and abdomen.	0.6123917867899938
Determination of radiation exposure applied by multi-phase spiral CT. Estimation of the dose in air in the system axis of the scanner, the CT dose index (CTDI) and the effective dose for electron beam tomography (EBT) and two conventional CT scanners (sequence, SEQ; spiral, SCT).	0.7043921041470461
For EBT, dose in system axis for investigation of the abdomen was above 50 mGy.	0.5189549275885371
Effective dose for investigation of the chest and abdomen was higher with EBT (11 and 26 mSv, respectively) than with conventional CT (SEQ, 4 and 20 mSv; SCT, 2 and 7 mSv).	0.7670321673887571
The effective dose for a biphasic investigation (liver 5 mSv, kidney 4 mSv) was below, for a triphasic investigation (liver 7 mSv) above the effective dose of the investigastion of the abdomen (6 mSv).	0.726989390669703
Investigation of the abdomen with the EBT should only be performed for certain indications.	0.7303910464829407
With spiral CT, effective dose is much lower than with EBT.	0.5519754822636487
Bone fracture, soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock are frequent complications in trauma patients, and these patients are known to be immunocompromised.	0.7818872899726771
Nonetheless, it is difficult to differentiate the effect of soft-tissue trauma plus hemorrhage from that of bone fracture and hemorrhage on host immune function in the clinical setting.	0.7257982713263386
To determine this experimentally, closed bone fracture (right lower leg) and/or soft-tissue trauma (2.5 cm midline laparotomy) were induced prior to hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial BP of 35  +/-  5 mm Hg for 90 min) in male C3H/HeN mice.	0.8043483960343536
All animals were killed at 72 h after initiation of the experiment and the spleens were collected aseptically.	0.4337680880690299
More significant depression of splenocyte IL-2 and IL-3 release occurred with the combined insult than after bony injury or tissue trauma alone with hemorrhage.	0.533299903797118
The present study suggests that different traumatic insults, i. e. bone fracture as well as soft-tissue trauma in conjunction with hemorrhagic shock, produce comparable depression of host immune function.	0.5700164452151106
Moreover, combination of closed bone fracture and soft-tissue trauma prior to hemorrhagic shock leads to even more compromised immunity.	0.5103261304861687
This indicates that different mechanisms of immune depression may be involved following soft-tissue trauma or bony injury coupled with hemorrhage.	0.4984248901711471
The markedly depressed immune function following bony injury, soft-tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock may contribute to the increased susceptibility of severely injured patients to sepsis and the ensuing multiple organ failure in the clinical situation.	0.6817651548692044
In the management of acute major vessel occlusion, the use of fibrinolytic agents such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), urokinase or streptokinase is widely accepted.	0.4796341635115878
Today, the spectrum of indications for thrombolytic drugs comprises acute myocardial infarction, lung embolism, ischaemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis and acute arterial occlusions of the lower limbs.	0.7142214473169484
In view of the histopathological and clinical features of retinal vessel occlusion, fibrinolysis aimed at early restoration of blood flow appears to be a promising therapeutic approach.	0.6732665180740404
Basically, it is of some concern that the systemic administration of fibrinolytic agents is associated with a haemorrhagic risk.	0.653076696542498
Since this includes cerebral haemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding, the choice of an appropriate intravenous thrombolytic therapy in a non-life threatening situation such as central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) should be based on minimising the risk of adverse events.	0.621734064711788
Furthermore, the fibrinolytic treatment of choice should be able to produce rapid and complete restoration of retinal capillary and arterial or venous blood flow and maintain patency long enough for retinal salvage to take place.	0.5869136834221089
In this article, we review several studies of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with retinal vessel occlusion to determine whether this treatment is likely to improve major clinical outcomes.	0.7399388036017013
Moreover, we review the large scale trials of fibrinolysis in myocardial infarction and acute ischaemic stroke to evaluate safety and efficacy of various thrombolytic regimens.	0.5829222630927644
Furthermore, we report on our results of fibrinolytic therapy with low dose rt-PA in patients with retinal artery occlusion and ischaemic central retinal vein occlusion.	0.8329728232052116
In light of the fact that the occurrence of bleeding complications constitutes a dose dependent problem, we conclude that the use of low dose regimens should be the ideal approach to fibrinolysis in retinal vessel occlusion.	0.6323619643608002
Although the results of our pilot studies must be interpreted with caution, we believe that the administration of low-dose rt-PA (50 mg) in a frontloaded manner ( = simultaneous administration of rt-PA and intravenous heparin) constitutes a reasonable treatment option in patients with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) or ischaemic retinal vein occlusion (RVO), recent onset of symptoms (CRAO <= 12 h, RVO <= 11 d) and severe visual loss ( <= 20/50).	0.8203413924105277
Because of these limitations and the numerous contraindications of fibrinolytic therapy, only a limited number of patients will be suitable for this treatment.	0.7566041866671026
In view of the poor visual and ocular prognosis in severe retinal vessel occlusion, controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the benefit of thrombolysis in the management of this disease.	0.7028677604426528
This study was designed to determine the relationship between the electroencephalogram (EEG) and clinical signs of depth of anaesthesia during induction of anaesthesia by slow infusion of propofol (18 mg/kg - h).	0.7881837906700266
The object of this study was to evaluate currently published data regarding extragenital neoplasia induced by HRT.	0.5492272685487504
Objective: This study was designed to investigate the differences between TIVA with propofol/remifentanil (P/R) and balanced anaesthesia with sevoflurane/fentanyl (S/F) in gynaecological laparoscopic surgery.	0.815882546143589
Emphasis was put on haemodynamic reaction, recovery profile, postoperative side effects and patient satisfaction.	0.6423023316483615
Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (CRP) is a rare dermatosis of unknown aetiology.	0.5978366186996583
Recent electron microscopic studies suggest that CRP is a disorder of keratinisation.	0.43015385774942677
In our case we could not confirm the previously reported ultrastructural findings.	0.5966820150535764
CRP is generally resistant to therapy.	0.2744165848771431
We treated a 19-year-old patient with typical CRP with oral minocycline.	0.6008408270964309
Within a few weeks the eruption resolved completely.	0.5405211363094458
A mild relapse 7 months later responded promptly to a repeated course of minocycline.	0.32988514019010623
Twelve months after discontinuatin of therapy there is no evidence of recurrence.	0.583603093783357
In CRP minocycline should be preferred to systemic retinoid therapy because of its minor side effects.	0.4565832791603988
Wound instillation seems to be an easy and preferable way to achieve postoperative analgesia in pediatric hernioplasty.	0.6081522205658502
This prospective, randomized and double-blinded pilot-study was initiated to gain preliminary information in order to define the appropriate concentration of local anaesthetic for efficient posthernioplastic analgesia.	0.6025991868822752
The recommended infusion time for i.v.	0.23669317496597017
prostaglandin E 1 (PGE1) therapy is 2 or 3 h, depending on the dose.	0.5617200362116652
The aim of the present multicentre study was to investigate, for the first time, whether the dose of 60 µg PGE1 is effective and well tolerated with shorter infusion times.	0.8824917311465996
A total of 118 patients with intermittent claudication and a pain-free walking distance between 50 and 200 m (3 km/h, 12%) were randomized to receive an i.v.	0.6904227570679764
infusion of 3 ampoules Prostavasin (60 µg PGE1) administered for either 1 or 2 h, once a day for 4 weeks.	0.6069471539351324
Primary variables were pain-free walking distance as well as safety, determined by the frequency of adverse events and the course of blood pressure.	0.67570748310604
The efficacy was comparable in the two groups.	0.45212690289214247
In the 1-h infusion group, the pain-free walking distance increased from 87 to 135 m, and in the 2-h group from 88 to 147 m, while the absolute walking distance increased from 124 to 200 m and from 147 to 238 m, respectively.	0.6870158142924672
The differences between the two groups were not significant, although an analysis of subgroups with initial pain-free walking distances of less than 80 m indicated a significant difference in favour of the 2-h PGE1 infusion (increase in walking distance 58 m as compared with 22 m).	0.6907956520516877
Course of blood pressure and frequency of adverse events were comparable in the two groups.	0.6881293117762637
Altogether, in intermittent claudication both the 1-h and the 2-h PGE1 infusion show comparably good results in terms of efficacy and safety.	0.677152649945732
Patients with an initial pain-free walking distance of less than 80 m seem to reveal a major benefit after a 2-h PGE1 infusion.	0.6142223753031193
The problem in the treatment of deep hyalin cartilage defects is due to the minimal regeneration potential of this specific tissue.	0.57297409452421
Several attempts were made to solve this difficulties experimentally and clinically.	0.35190970558411466

Fractionated irradiation with X-rays or megavoltage is an important therapeutic option in the palliative treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma.	0.6579491380579251
We report on three HIV patients demonstrating bullous cutaneous eruptions in the irradiation field.	0.5822743069075216
Three homosexual men (age 45-60 y) stage of disease CDC 3C, were treated with fractionated soft X-rays with the scheme conventionally used by us (total dose 30 Gy, single doses 3 Gy).	0.6111429473565694
Immediately to three days after completion of treatment large blisters appeared within the irradiation field, resolving after 2-4 weeks, leaving postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.	0.509231294556227
The cause of this rare reaction to soft X-ray therapy, potentially suggesting an individually altered radiation sensitivity, is so far unknown.	0.7502635447872005
Controlled prospective studies applying different fractionation schemes will be necessary to better elucidate this issue.	0.4231725344557953
Due to the decreased trauma in anterior as well as posterior surgical approaches to the spine, microsurgical techniques have been used more frequently in recent years.	0.707914603382396
This article describes two new microsurgical techniques to approach the anterior lumbar spine for interbody fusion as part of a posterior-anterior stabilization concept in various diseases like spondylolisthesis, degenerative instability; failed back surgery syndrome, fractures etc.	0.5248561962019898
The lumbar segments L 2-5 are approached through a blunt muscle-splitting retroperitoneal technique.	0.4328503630938946
The antero-lateral circumference of the motion segment is exposed with a frame-type retractor which is anchored in the adjacent vertebral bodies with anchoring screws.	0.4121281202315878
The lumbosacral junction is exposed via a mini-laparotomy using a special soft tissue spreader.	0.33587330623497336
Interbody fusion is described with autogeneous bone grafts.	0.36255303750231893
Preliminary experience with 83 patients treated between 1995 and 1996 show that peri- and postoperative morbidity is low.	0.7161633236980157
Clinical as well as radiological results are comparable to the standard techniques.	0.5214192423187947
Spectrum as well as rate of complications so far do not differ from those described in the literature for non-microsurgical approaches.	0.6609890932612065
The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is the strongest ligament of the human knee joint.	0.7503709876806851
Its origin is at the lateral wall of the medial femoral condyle and the insertion is located in the posterior part of the intercondylar area.	0.7720029891285167
The posterior cruciate ligament consists of multiple small fiber bundles.	0.3350520215701611
From a functional point of view, one can differentiate fiber bundles with an anterior origin and fiber bundles with a posterior origin at the femur.	0.5800649065969065
The anterior fibers insert in the anterolateral part of the tibial insertion zone.	0.4756270228952553
These fibers become tense when the knee is flexed.	0.2115823691776287
The posterior fibers insert in the posteromedial part of the tibial insertion and become tense when the knee is extended.	0.47267105077560434
The main part of the posterior cruciate ligament consists of type I collagen positive dense connective tissue.	0.5632948957398055
The longitudinal fibrils of type I collagen are divided into small bundles by thin type III collagen positive fibrils.	0.41049596582467063
In the center of the middle third region, the structure of the tissue varies from the typical structure of a ligament.	0.703594768555488
In this region, the structure of the tissue resembles fibrocartilage.	0.7654102383853754
Oval-shaped cells surrounded by a metachromatic extracellular matrix lie between the longitudinal collagen fibrils.	0.38587622365183616
The femoral origin and the tibial insertion have the structure of chondral apophyseal enthesis.	0.525356939476746
Near the anchoring region at the femur and tibia there should be various mechanoreceptors which might have an important function for the kinematics of the knee joint.	0.5923830000969303
The blood supply of the PCL arises from the middle geniculate artery.	0.5804586557286618
The ligament is covered by a synovial fold where the terminal branches of the middle and the inferior geniculate artery form a periligamentous network.	0.5671960703103452
From the synovial sheath, the blood vessels penetrate the ligament in a transverse direction and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network.	0.4914320412395356
The distribution of blood vessels within the PCL is not homogeneous.	0.489844736760495
We detected three avascular areas within the ligament: Both fibrocartilaginous entheses of the PCL are devoid of blood vessels.	0.42380922743604327
A third avascular zone is located in the central zone of fibrocartilage of the middle third region.	0.5083051387686955
Atrial reentrant tachycardias (ART) are a potentially life-threatening complication in survivors of congenital heart disease surgery.	0.6587839432366803
From July 1993 to December 1997, temporary transesophageal pacing was used to convert 29 tachycardia episodes in 19 patients.	0.48301096805526184
At the time of the first tachycardia episode, patients' ages were 1 month to 26 years (mean 9.8 yrs).	0.8279131843883442
Time from operation to onset of first tachycardia episode ranged from 1 day to 19 years.	0.4209539570991198
Onset was within the first 2 weeks postoperatively in 6 patients and occurred later in 13 patients (1 to 19 years after operation).	0.8122813908460789
Postoperative pacemaker implantation had been performed in 2 pts; 17 of 19 pts were receiving antiarrhythmic medication.	0.523729424527246
After placing a quadripolar transesophageal catheter, atrial and ventricular signals were recorded and atrial stimulation performed.	0.374882874830584
Atrial cycle length of tachycardia ranged from 160-380 ms with 1:1 to 4:1 AV conduction.	0.49405777557851366
Temporary transesophageal pacing was performed following an algorithm starting with 4 extrastimuli (20 ms below atrial cycle length of tachycardia).	0.45979333489274476
Tachycardia terminated in 27 of 29 cases (93%) without complications.	0.5609208008049578
In 3 cases, conversion was achieved by pacing after amiodarone 5 mg/kg i.v.	0.5428449614422661
After tachycardia conversion, sinus- or pacemaker rhythm was present in 20 cases.	0.6005024507558736
In 9 cases atrial fibrillation was recorded; spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm occurred after a maximum of 3 min (7 cases) or persisted and required direct current cardioversion (2 cases).	0.7288698585830476
In conclusion, transesophageal atrial pacing is an effective, relatively noninvasive method for conversion of atrial reentrant tachycardias after operation for congenital heart disease.	0.507602631331222
After elucidating the components and theory of neuroticism (N) as well as of psychosomatic complaints and their relationships to personality dimensions and to psychosomatic diseases, comparisons are performed between patients suffering from fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) or related pain diseases with healthy subjects scoring high on personality dimensions related to neuroticism.	0.5520068276724374
FMS and pain patients score high on depression, anxiety, and experience of stress although questionnaire scores on depression are higher in subjects not exhibiting somatic features of the disease.	0.5332999252182283
High subjective pain sensitivity and low thresholds for pain perception are also common features in high N subjects and FMS patients.	0.4098831717377234
On the endocrinological level cortisol responses to challenge tests with CRH as well as prolactin responses to TRH are higher in FMS patients than in high N healthy subjects indicating an endocrinological difference.	0.41873446817153104
A common feature, however, is the lack of adapatability in the two groups, since neurotics are in particular characterized by a low capacity to shift their behavior from one state to the other (waking-sleeping, working-relaxing), to re-adapt to baseline levels after endocrinological or physiological stress responses, or to adjust to conditions of shift work.	0.6125176623698194
This is reflected by chronobiological disturbances in FMS patients and could also explain their maintainance of pain perception, because they are incapable of correcting conditioned pain-producing muscle tension.	0.5049263547981238
Purpose: To document our experience with spiral hydro-CT of the pancreas based on a combination of pharmacologic intestinal paralysis and water distension of the stomach and duodenum with specific reference to tumor detection rate, differentiation of malignant versus benign tumors and assessment of tumor resectability in a prospective study on 211 consecutive patients.	0.6261309495175339
Since the publication of a case of Syphilis transmission by blood transfusion in 1915 the discussion about transfusion-associated bacterial infection is ongoing.	0.5591980027475019
For some time, virus infections through blood and blood products have been highlighted.	0.44780316954092236
However, in the last years the attention required has been drawn to the problem of transmission of bacteria.	0.8425191159425077
In this publication the present situation concerning the contamination rates through blood components and the frequency of transfusion-associated microbial infections is outlined.	0.4527570152121318
The bacteria involved are discussed.	0.22270852137502262
Furthermore, the state of the art for prevention and diagnosis as well as the methods for inactivation of bacteria are assessed.	0.6645765198173413
While working to develop a distal locking device, we analyzed distal nail position with reference to nail deformation and a radiographic-morphometric investigation.	0.5897160511546592
The amount and the direction of implant deformation in unslotted stainless steel unreamed tibial nails (Synthes) were analyzed.	0.5535419879913435
Measurement of implant deformation (3 translations, 3 angles) in the center of the distal transverse locking hole was performed with a 3D magnetic motion tracker system before and after nail insertion.	0.7680455409263247
Unreamed tibial nails (diameter 8 mm, n = 10; diameter 9 mm, n = 10) were inserted in paired human cadaver tibiae.	0.5857041450699724
The results showed lateral translations of -4.5+/-3.5 mm (mean and standard deviation, range 14.3 mm) and dorsal translations of -7.8+/-5.8 mm (mean and standard deviation, range 19.2 mm).	0.9506033953054227
Rotational deformations around the longitudinal axis of the nail were 0.3+/-0.7 ° (mean and standard deviation, range 2.4 °).	0.7275989995961935
The results showed, that a simple aiming arm, mounted on the proximal nail end, alone or even in combination with a large working channel (e.g.	0.6010433404283972
10 mm in diameter), was not adequate to the aiming process.	0.7006794880015812
A radiographic-morphometric analysis was subsequently performed in 40 tibiae after experimental (n = 20) or clinical (n = 20) implantation of nails 8 mm and 9 mm in diameter.	0.5137443458727078
These measurements showed a relatively constant distance between the upper distal transverse hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia (average 12.3 mm and only a narrow range (7.6 mm).	0.7379994864697518
These data were the basis for the development of an aiming technique that exploits the relatively constant distance between the distal nail hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia.	0.635794252835629
The goal of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Aging (ILSE) is to assess healthy and satisfying aging in middle adulthood and later life.	0.6038817587438032
In addition, this study compares adults from eastern and western Germany.	0.6471706939825234
The data for this study were collected between late 1993 and early 1996 as part of the first measurement point of the ILSE.	0.6875703828024671
Five-hundred and one participants from the Leipzig region were compared with 500 participants from the Heidelberg area on four specific dimensions: personality, cognitive functioning, subjective well-being, and health.	0.6017267462165273
Age differences were obtained for neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness.	0.5693595827290151
Differences were also obtained in cognitive functioning and health.	0.3984849281781161
Regional differences between eastern and western Germany were obtained in the personality dimensions neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness, as well as in subjective well-being.	0.5912429989240271
Significant age by region interactions were obtained for openness and some of the cognitive measures, as well as for the physicians' health ratings of the participants, suggesting selective historical effects.	0.5758014537336545
The results are discussed with respect to functional abilities and levels of satisfaction in midlife, as well as with respect to regional differences that might be due to prior political system differences in the east and west.	0.5664719903481837
Modern obstetrics must try to maintain high safety standards for both mother and child and, at the same time, satisfy the general desire of women for natural birth.	0.5237146459868762
Standards of safety are based on early recognition of high risks, allowing early intervention to prevent serious complications.	0.5352812252076454
A considerable number of diagnostic and therapeutic measures recommended on a prophylactic basis and therefore widely used are responsible for the medical-technical image associated with modern obstetrics.	0.6081032026161644
The benefits of most of these prophylactically recommended activities are unproven or low relative to the unavoidable side effects and the costs associated with widespread application.	0.565191107808681
There is good scientific proof that routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring during labor and delivery is associated with an increase in the rate of cesarean sections as well as operative vaginal deliveries without any clear benefit to the newborn in terms of a decrease in mortality or morbidity.	0.6100276370830938
In a population of healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies, the prevalence of perinatal mortality or morbidity is so low that even with meta-analysis of several studies the numbers remain too small to show significant differences for these rare events.	0.6408833947540731
In high-risk cases the routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring throughout labor and delivery is undisputed and leads to a significant drop in morbiditiy and mortality of the baby.	0.6598449372777093
With careful selection of pregnant women a combination of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and auscultation during certain segments of the first stage of labor provides adequate surveillance.	0.5300167964620579

The "eye-of-the-tiger"-sign, a bilateral hyperintensity in the rostral globus pallidus, was not observed in follow-up examinations.	0.7609310607097182
HSD is a rare autosomal-recessive or sporadic disease of unknown etiology.	0.6207639976485689
In one third of the patients a dementing process is the first clinical sign of the disorder, and is a rare differential diagnosis of early onset dementia.	1.0757157940680186
In 33 patients with chronic venous incompetence (CVI) caused by primary varicoses or postthrombotic syndrome stage I-III (according to Widmer) the therapeutic benefit of 6 months of medically supervised physical exercise training was documented.	0.6819945381632739

Epileptic seizures may alter autonomic functions.	0.20449588737630228
This is especially the case with complex focal seizures (of temporal lobe origin) and grand mal.	0.640401064926946
Most frequently, such seizures cause ictal tachycardia, sometimes tachypnea, probably caused by the propagation of epileptic discharges to autonomic cerebral structures.	0.5773670797495182
Ictal bradycardia and asystole are rare phenomena.	0.2415871085315603
However, they may be life threatening.	0.7822672611239676
Their differentiation from primary cardiac arrest is possible by the use of ictal EEG and ECG registration.	0.46417135366296475
Postictal serum prolactin measurement does not differentiate syncope from seizure.	0.22982569975715048
However, a postictal increase of creatine kinase is only measured after epileptic seizures and not after syncope.	0.4723054619517836
Treatment of such epileptic seizures includes an optimization of anticonvulsant drug therapy and the implantation of a cardiac demand stimulator.	0.6381513802887502
There is growing evidence that ictal asystole is a cofactor in sudden unexplained death in epileptic patients.	0.32125541367538063

Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rare semimalignant cutaneous neoplasm characterised by slow but locally aggressive growth.	0.4948747358147129
Its histogenesis and nomenclature are still a subject of controversy.	0.4597696760985647
Under-recognition and the tumour's bland cytologic features lead to frequent misdiagnoses.	0.29868136737262957
In addition, subclinical tumour invasion explains the high incidence of local recurrence.	0.4124821389623964
Thus, the tumour makes great demands on the planning of its surgical removal.	0.589755304024526
We report the case of an 81-year-old woman with a microcystic adnexal carcinoma of the lower lip, which was treated by micrographic surgery.	0.8992880712628667
On the basis of this case, differential diagnoses, histogenesis and micrographic surgery as the treatment of choice are discussed.	0.7411126011846778

Posttraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is associated with a poor outcome.	0.555546265962676
When evaluating the literature according to the Utstein method, there were only 2 survivors (0.18%) out of 1,135 CPR attempts after trauma (Table 1).	0.6612292047185018
Differences in the study populations and levels of prehospital trauma care led us to analyse the results of a physician-staffed prehospital trauma care system in Cologne.	0.7056527815115278
From January 1987 to December 1990, a total of 49,054 emergency calls were registered using a standardised protocol.	0.5904932521145726
Among 9,595 trauma-related calls, 636 patients were found to be pulseless on arrival of the emergency team, 412 of these were pronounced dead.	0.5010136693640705
CPR was initiated in the remaining 224 patients, who comprise the study population (defined as 100%).	0.6592957508289815
All patients who were admitted to a hospital were followed using a second protocol.	0.7587245134185531
CPR in the field was successful in 68 (30.4%) patients, who were then admitted to a hospital; 42 of these died within the first 24 h. Four patients (1.8%) could be discharged from hospital alive and were still living 1 year later, 1 with a lasting neurological deficit (Fig.	0.8356928123004995
In 156 (69.6%) cases resuscitative attempts were unsuccessful in the field.	0.5702547782837364
Even in a physician-staffed prehospital trauma care system, the chance of surviving a post-traumatic cardiac arrest is minimal.	0.5855735817940443
Survival has to be regarded as an individual fate; the overall results are discouraging.	0.7432094736559846
Even though this study analyses the largest population of posttraumatic CPR ever published, prognostic factors could not be identified due to the few survivors.	0.5521964772391713
Nevertheless, the result does not justify general omission of CPR after trauma as: (1) prognostic factors for survival have not been identified thus far; and (2) no significant additional costs arise from posttraumatic CPR.	0.6979006978330854
Functional voiding disturbances can be due to failure of the detrusor or to discoordinated sphincter function during micturition.	0.4078369968407517
Therapeutical options are directed either to strengthening the contraction up to an adequate magnitude or to lowering the voiding resistance or can be aimed at influencing both.	0.4109907767434979
In a brief survey mechanical, pedagogical, electrotherapeutical, and surgical measures as well as drug treatment are critically examined.	0.5715916241814539
Conservative methods should always be attempted before surgical procedures are performed.	0.4973126317388263
Depending on the degree of severity and the etiology of the disease, a combined therapy can be useful.	0.8674806096071469
In the case of resistance to therapy, intermittent autocatheterism is to be preferred to permanent deviation via an indwelling catheter.	0.5902235733394479
During long-term therapy of hyperuricaemia with allopurinol (300 mg/d) two patients developed generalized granuloma annulare.	0.5839237129457492
The diagnoses were confirmed by histology; concomitant diseases, especially diabetes mellitus, were not detectable.	0.7122229335639265
Following discontinuation of allopurinol therapy, cutaneous granulomas healed without relapse.	0.39443787263835256
Hyperuricaemia could be controlled by low-purine diet and medication avoiding allopurinol.	0.42213616250705416
The clinical history of our two patients suggested a causal connection between allopurinol therapy and generalized granuloma annulare.	0.47941305111377386
For this reason we rate the development of this disease in both cases as a rare but significant side effect of allopurinol.	0.8557018557899015
This should give rise to critical assessment of concomitant drug therapy during development of generalized granuloma annulare.	0.4035043303356993
Background: Aim of the present prospective longitudinal study was the statistical foundation and thus further replication of recent findings of Hasenbring [13], who postulated a significant importance of specific, within the psychological pain research long neglected pain coping strategies as risk factors concerning pain chronification: appeals to "stick it out" on the cognitive level and endurance strategies on the behavioural level.	0.5875264311997649
Intraarticular bleeding and muscle bleeding occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma in hemophilia A or B.	0.42943182610267544
The most common sites for hemarthrosis are the knees joints, elbows and ankles joints.	0.5057683017923471
Resorption of intraarticular blood induces reactive hemophilic synovitis.	0.2466644370850951
Hyperplasia of the synovium can be followed by recurrent bleedings.	0.4906378345458315
These early reactions can change to a chronic synovitis and cause cartilage damage, finally resulting in a complete destruction of the joint.	0.6180163975049711
Since 1981 158 adults and 61 children with a hemophilia A or B were treated at the Center for hemophilic disorders Frankfurt in an interdisciplinary approach.	0.5061702049752709
Consequent prophylactic treatment with factor substitution can prevent the incidence of severe hemarthrosis.	0.46603541782763136
Minor joint bleedings are treated by adequate factor substitution, temporarily non-weight bearing of the extremity, application of ice-packs and physical therapy.	0.5169288131066221
More severe joint hemorrhages should be aspirated in order to reduce the acute synovitis.	0.47393256664504196
This is followed by a consequent physical therapy (joint and soft tissue techniques) and anti-inflammatory drugs.	0.6472108951251635
The goal is a sufficient muscular balance of the joint, the improvement of the coordination, and the proprioception.	0.8587810587783098
The chronic synovitis is less painful and poorly responses to conservative interventions.	0.3709149595876467
Local ice application, sytemic and local anti-inflammatory treatment support the physical therapy.	0.4225784557410775
Soft heel shock absorber, elastic and semi-rigid bandages prevent recurrent bleeding episodes by shock absorption and decrease of synovial impingement.	0.3337515661011515
Synovectomy is indicated in cases of chronic persistent synovitis.	0.5550351041398089
Radiosynoviorthesis (RSO), which is an alternative in certain cases, has been performed with great success in 12 cases in our hospital.	0.8093979501514558
In advanced arthropathy joint mobilization should be the emphasis of the physical therapy.	0.5115951081922648
Bandages, crutches and ortopaedic shoe devices improve the walking capacity.	0.2267331270673856
Over an 18-month period findings of stress X-ray of the ankle and medical records of 112 cases were analyzed retrospectively as to indications, results and therapeutic consequences.	0.6695297437746331
The analysis showed that critical setting of indications can reduce the frequency of stress X-ray of the ankle and thus lower the total costs.	0.6438335891406352
The introduction of guidelines could be advantageous at medical training institutions.	0.33691398138003414
A 72-year-old patient received 0.1 mg morphine by the intrathecal route and 2x1.5 mg midazolam as adjuvant therapy.	0.665037063103359
Severe respiratory depression and somnolence supervened 3.5 h later, which lasted over the next 24 h and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation.	0.6645178758441982
Continuous administration of >6 mg naloxone to antagonize the supposed effect of the morphine had no effect.	0.5025421796109645
The patient's condition was not normalized until a single dose of 0.3 mg flumazenil was administered.	0.7632446345786986
For the time being, especially in the case of elderly patients, we recommend that strict indications are adhered to when intrathecal administration of morphine is considered and that less than 0.1 mg morphine is given.	0.7748295301077283
Respiration should be monitored for quite some time.	0.3804882177209977
In contrast to the often debated NYHA classification, the determination of peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) by cardiopulmonary exercise testing allows an objective assessment of the exercise capacity of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF).	0.6370676016806531
However, cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a time consuming and costly diagnostic tool, which requires sophisticated equipment and specially trained personell.	0.6359315332495192
Exercise capacity can also be determined by the 6 minute walk test.	0.5122226034936241
This test simply measures the distance covered by strong walking on a hallway level within 6 minutes.	0.381855555010967
The 6 minute walk test is a submaximal exercise test, which is associated with much smaller increments in heart rate, blood pressure and plasma catecholamines than cardiopulmonary exercise testing.	0.6569748555220242
It is characterized by a very small intraindividual variance.	0.5033738162576288
Furthermore, it can be easily performed and, due to low logistic and personal requirements, it is very cost effective.	0.6968986501446669
The results of the 6 minute walk test - as well as of cardiopulmonary exercise testing - are influenced by extracardial exercise-limiting disorders, such as pulmonary diseases.	0.6862928108105109
Independent from the etiology of CHF, the results of the 6 minute walk test are closely related to peak VO2.	0.6617508843881563
In serial exercise testing the distance covered within 6 minutes allow to predict the individual peak VO2.	0.49240265189745663
Like peak VO2 the 6 minute walk test has been shown to be a predictor of morbidity and mortality in CHF, with its predictive value being independent from left ventricular ejection fraction and other potential prognostic parameters.	0.645512477626671
In CHF patients a walking distance < 300 m is associated with a one-year-mortality of up to 50%, whereas the one-year-mortality in patients reaching a walking distance > 450 m amounts to only a few percent.	0.8457817015787332
In addition, the hospitalization rate of patients reaching a walking distance of < 300 m is several fold higher than in those with a walking distance >= 450 m. Like cardiopulmonary exercise testing, the 6 minute walk test allows to control the efficiency of specific treatments and to monitor the natural course of the disease.	0.7030427859802573
The 6 minute walk test is, thus, a cost effective alternative to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in CHF patients.	0.5720667936771253
However, neither the 6 minute walk test alone nor the results of cardiopulmonary exercise testing alone are sufficient for selecting patients, e.g., for cardiac transplantation, as each individual case requires a synopsis of all relevant facts and parameters.	0.6248699586193632
We report the first case of prurigo pigmentosa in the German literature.	0.7447308450926459
For over a year, a 16-year old white girl developed an immensely pruritic symmetrical reticular, papulo-vesicular eruption on the trunk, axillae and pubic region.	0.48496882740592673
Histologically a superficial  perivascular spongiotic and lichenoid  inflammatory pattern with prominent pigmentary incontinence in older lesions was observed.	0.37460065617957733
Topical corticosteroids and  systemic antihistamines had no effect.	0.3525752448462075
Systemic corticosteroids and diaminophenylsulphone (DADPS) produced improvement but could not prevent recurrences.	0.3665349192407086
Healing  occurred only after 4 weeks of systemic- minocycline.	0.5114017285835298
Following parenteral administration, clonidine has analgesic effects at both cerebral and spinal levels.	0.3718706057541226
Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) makes it possible to determine equipotent dosages of analgesics by relating analgesic consumption per time to the levels of analgesia obtained in comparable patient populations.	0.48793810501364276
Therefore, we studied the equipotency ratios of clonidine and piritramide and the incidence of undesired side effects in the treatment of postoperative pain in patients undergoing maxillo-facial surgery.	0.7008525627280389
The effects of glycerol are discussed in detail.	0.4837646132238818
Glycerol can lead to a transition of crystalline lipid structures within the horny layer lipids into liquid crystalline states.	0.4227081616151203
Especially if applied in oil/water-emulsions it improves, the hydration of the horny layers better than urea.	0.4649302389226285
In addition, if facilitates the dissolution of desmosomes within the superior layers of the horny layer enhancing desquamation.	0.4782014326806055
Furthermore, by using glycerol, the mechanical properties of the skin can be influenced; long term used leads to increased elasticity.	0.8009360430992385
The roughness of the horny layer is reduced, which can be explained by the abrasive and/or the hydrating effect.	0.662291432528946
Glycerol used in o/w-emulsions also protects against the influence of tensides or noxious lipophilic agents.	0.3195839926514605
Presumably a flux from the base of the epidermis towards its surface triggers the regeneration of the barrier.	0.4596827093843364
Finally,  glycerol can lead - similarly to urea - to an improvement in active agent penetration, as has been proven for hexylnicotinate.	0.8426078820394304
Background: An 18-year-old woman presented with thyrotoxic symptoms - right sided lid retraction and exophthalmus.	0.6727469011690733
She complained of diplopia on lateral gaze.	0.1933333219399357
Laboratory investigations confirmed Grave's disease with hyperthyroidism and TSH receptor antibodies.	0.25089326964252384
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.	0.6289455325710848
The safe and effective treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias is being intensively studied.	0.7258255594513184
Internal electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation has been shown to be an effective non-pharmacological treatment option.	0.7506562156769813
Cardioversion therapy has been applied in the absence of a clear understanding of the mechanisms governing the process.	0.6116660732557722
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using sophisticated optical mapping techniques reveal that internal cardioversion shocks cause changes in repolarization time that favor annihilation of wave fronts.	0.2997058920016527
Thus, mechanisms of atrial cardioversion appear to be similar to ventricular defibrillation.	0.45893863738089596
Further studies are needed to determine whether cardioversion mechanisms differ for chronic atrial fibrillation compared to acute atrial fibrillation.	0.49503679037299253
Plasmocytic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common tumor of bone and bone marrow, typically diagnosed by symptoms such as monoclonal paraproteinemia, proteinuria, anemia and hypercalcemia.	0.6031215587399784
In its progress, deposits of amyloids in  almost all organs can be observed.	0.4503717949836073
However, plasmacytomas which are diagnosed by macroglossia of primarily unknown etiology are rare.	0.39356130282469315
This case report presents a 61-year-old woman who suffered from a persistent swelling of the tongue with painful ulcerations.	0.7079319118600765
A biopsy led to the diagnosis of primary systemic amyloidosis of the light-chain type, which subsequently proved to be a plasmacytoma with lambda light-chains stage II after Durie and Salmon.	0.634602638572812
In the course of the disease the patient developed further deposits of amyloids in the whole gastro-enteric system.	0.66975984985396
Macroglossia as a primary manifestation of plasmacytoma is rarely described in medical literature.	0.4660815641901947
However, reports on deposits of amyloid in the tongue in advanced stages of disease are well known.	0.6379509629751816
Aim: Improved detection of pulmonary-venous pathologies by imaging the pulmonary veins without arterial overlay.	0.48253770314469624
For the histological verification of suspicious non-palpable small breast tumors, the three-dimensional breast biopsy applied as cylindrical extirpation using the ABBI system is the optimal solution at present.	0.5447124949416642
Because of the possibility of performing mammography during the operation, errors of localization can be corrected and incorrect incisions avoided.	0.4987858665173582
Taking the three radiomorphologically leading symptoms into consideration - suspicious microcalcification, focal shadow and structural irregularity - it can be stated that the digital mammography of the ABBI system is more sensitive than the conventional one for detecting microcalcification, but focal shadow and structural irregularity are detected less well by digital technique.	0.5695515998029439
These structures should be preoperatively marked by using sonography.	0.33699786327140313
After the complete removal of suspicious microcalcification checked by digital mammography during the operation, residual tumor might be found in a second excision when histologically invasive or intraductal tumor terminations reach the excision margin (R1 resection).	0.5524306350876087
Thirteen invasive and 8 intraductal carcinomas were found in 80 cases of cylindrical extirpation using the ABBI system.	0.4423246797481583
In 7 procedures carried out to exclude an in-breast recurrence, 3 intraductal carcinomas and 1 invasive carcinoma were observed.	0.5805605481464732
In 8 of 12 invasive carcinomas and in 1 of 5 intraductal carcinomas, breast-conserving therapy was indicated.	0.6014006230583849
Two cases of invasive carcinoma fulfilled the criteria applied (minimal tumor-free margin > 2 mm, no extensive intraductal component) to use the ABBI cylinder as lumpectomy without a second excision to follow.	0.7460110863019237
With the increasing number of patients surviving after therapeutic intervention for congenital heart disease (CHD), accurate and frequent follow-up of their morphologic and functional cardiovascular status is required, preferably with a noninvasive imaging technique.	0.6456025313413177
In a retrospecitve multicenter study we followed-up 30 fractures of the neck of the femur in children aged 11 years (1.5-15 years) for 4.8 years (0.5-20.0 years).	0.9097663291037701
It is the aim of this study to analyse factors possibly related to outcome, like age at injury, type of fracture, interval between injury and treatment, method of stabilization and postoperative interval until full weight bearing.	0.6913621156969132
At follow-up subjective parameters (pain, weather sensitiveness), clinical parameters (range of motion, claudication, leg length discrepancies) and radiological parameters (hip series) were investigated and medical charts and roentgenograms were reviewed using a standardized protocol.	0.7219805558323603
29 of 30 children (96.7 %) have sustained displaced fractures.	0.6524667050775261
Non-operative treatment has been applied in 4 children.	0.7316528184585468
26 femoral neck fractures (type I: 1, type II: 8, type III: 17) were stabilized by internal fixation using screws and/or pins.	0.8111056842988942
Following non-operative treatment one child suffered a coxa vara and another child suffered a avascular femoral head necrosis in combination with coxa vara and leg length shortening of 4 cm.	0.5560708351780497
Following operative treatment 9 of 26 children (34.6 %) sufferred a avascular femoral head necrosis and 3 children (11.5 %) suffered a coxa vara.	0.6495089701982256
In 6 of 26 children (23 %) we observed leg length discrepancies > 2 cm.	0.7411800689389553
We were not able to demonstrate any significant follow-up result differencies between the groups of children who have sustained type II or type III fractures, or between the groups of children aged < 10 years when compared to children aged > 10 years, or between the group of children who were operated on within 6 hours after the accident when compared to the group of children operated > 6 hours after the accident.	0.8120378466336423
We observed no significant follow-up result differences between the groups of children who had different intervals between operation and full weight bearing.	0.582598997489891
Operative fracture management remains the treatment of choice in the majority of displaced femoral neck fractures in children.	0.6506778759647646
However, in our limited study we were not able to demonstrate any significant follow-up result differences between the group of children treated by immediate open reduction and internal fixation (interval injury - operation < 6 hours) when compared to children who had been operated > 6 hours after the injury.	0.8141889674705972
Evidence based standards for structure quality in out-patient management of chronic pain states do not exist.	0.5897201088173485
Therefore we tried to evaluate if german standards for outpatient management of chronic pain states which are based on opinions of experts for pain management influence the outcome quality of independent physicians for treatment of chronic low back pain.	0.6844659294951592
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare low dose dopamine and dopexamine with respect to of liver-venous oxygen saturation, oxygen delivery and - demand, liver function tests and cardiocirculatory effects  in the reperfusion period during a hemihepatectomy operation with occlusion of the liver hilus.	0.6908594882320173

Due to this main etiologic factor, trauma to the facial skeleton is often associated with serious injuries, commonly involving the brain, chest or abdomen.	0.5573837455777256
As a consequence, the initial clinical management of these patients includes control of hemorrhage and immediate assessment of life-threatening injuries, including the maintenance of the airways.	0.887966044873691
Patients presenting with facial trauma are initially evaluated with a systematic clinical examination because many fractures can be accurately diagnosed by inspection and palpation alone.	0.44987589569106196
In these cases plain film radiographs serve only for confirmation and documentation of the diagnosis.	0.6473087557918678
In many other cases accompanying and extensive soft tissue swelling may clinically obscure fractures.	0.36812333735256886
A complete and accurate evaluation of these patients requires additional radiological imaging methods.	0.5713748553431779
A series of plain films may be generally sufficient but in most of the cases they can be regarded as initial screening methods for more thorough diagnosis with computed tomography (CT).	0.561936543407083
In trauma patients CT is the imaging method of choice because it shows more fracture lines and displaced fragments than any other imaging modality.	0.5690766229289733
CT delineates soft tissue and bony structures and can localize and even characterize foreign bodies.	0.4254190317120917
A complete and accurate characterization of the fracture type and potentially associated complications is mandatory for the appropriate treatment and can only be achieved by careful radiological (CT) evaluation.	0.6995949787363293
On the basis of the claims data of the statutory health insurance funds, surgery rates and small-area variations within the catchment area of the AOK Magdeburg were examined for the year 1997.	0.6357763413312951
Substantial variation can be constantly seen.	0.1983158497319209
The extremal quotient at the 30 most frequent ICPM groups ranged from 2 to 5.	0.3219497826964749
Generally, the extent of the variation was larger with elective procedures than with acute.	0.5469140099058709
Correlation analyses do not show clear associations with hospital bed supply and physician density in primary sectors.	0.34055202544331786
The extent of the small-area variation requires further research to evaluate possible determinants of surgery rates.	0.6589639825112835
Criteria for hospital admission and indications for surgery should be made explicit.	0.6223488674750924
Between 1984 and 1994 the legally required task force "Advisory Committee to the German Federal Health Office in Matters of Approval and Review of Existing Medicines B3-Psychiatry, Neurology, Anesthesiology" analyzed and evaluated the CNS-active compounds that until then had only possessed a fictitious registration.	0.4400604488803943
The evaluation was related to efficacy and safety within the indications claimed by the producers.	0.4822934040627878
Reviews and monographies had to be established for 445 basic compounds.	0.47109706585699646
One hundred positive and 30 negative monographies were published.	0.284747700498143
"Negative" indicates that none of the claimed indications could be accepted by the committee.	0.42272863331904686
It is regrettable that the Federal Health Agency did not notice a considerable part of these negative evaluations until the present date.	0.3919893146764878
The process of the "Aufbereitung" was stopped abruptly by the 5th amendment of the German Drug Law in August 1994, - a very doubtful political decision with respect to drug safety in this country.	0.7068686743861908
Background: We attempted to illustrate connections between selected metabolic parameters and the inflammation course in patients after cataract operations.	0.5891049805926266
Without a more detailed knowledge of etiology and pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis final conclusions regarding an association between physical trauma and the onset or course of multiple sclerosis cannot be drawn.	0.5780156605896491
Only a few prospective studies which are appropriately designed to prove a putative correlation have been published.	0.5673697093489916
A critical review of these studies and some case reports, in the light of the current pathophysiological concepts of multiple sclerosis, does not indicate a causal relationship between physical trauma and onset of multiple sclerosis or exacerbations.	0.694983731680094
We report on unusual presentation forms of Pneumocystis carinii infection of the lung in two patients with AIDS.	0.7627143067608028
A 36-years-old woman presented a cavitation in the lung middle lobe and bullous changes in the apical portion of the right upper lobe on the chest x-ray.	0.6601953800660274
The biopsy of these lesions was not diagnostic and the patient was operated on.	0.8231633426027616
The surgical specimen of the removed lung segment showed a cavitary lesion with a border of granulation tissue with giant cells, focal recent and older hemorrhages, rests of fibrinous exudate and dystrophic calcifications.	0.38709797695431214
In the surrounding tissue there were Pneumocystis carinii in the alveolar spaces and also in the alveolar walls, this tissue invasion through the organisms being most probably the cause of the cavitary change.	0.6310850171058773
A cytomegalic virus infection was also found.	0.4023030672376622
In aortic atresia, coronary perfusion normally occurs through retrograde blood flow in the ascending aorta.	0.4840003640866728
We report on two patients with antegrade flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia.	0.4981906863108149
In one patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (aortic atresia, severe mitral stenosis), an intact interatrial septum/premature closure of the foramen ovale was found.	0.5960892605267695
While no other way of left atrial or ventricular decompression was found, echocardiography, angiography and the post-mortem examination showed left ventricular to coronary sinusoids as the sole pathway for systemic oxygenation.	0.5166361591560963
In a second patient with complex congenital heart disease, including aortic atresia, antegrade flow in the ascending aorta was through a left coronary fistula with shunt flow originating from the pulmonary trunc.	0.6031292547066374
This report describes systemic perfusion depending on retrograde coronary flow due to coronary-cameral (sinusoids) and coronary arterio-venous fistulas leading to the phenomenon of antegrade blood flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia.	0.5315407893169255
The introduction of biosensor technology for near bedside measurement of plasma lactate concentrations has been a promising step for critical care profiling.	0.4592930312894157
However, methodological drawbacks and relevant inaccuracy have been reported.	0.3831146678371909
With the advent of a new biosensor (Chiron Diagnostics) and a revised NOVA Biomedical device, accuracy was expected to be improved.	0.6796005735026222
The goal of the present investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of both methods.	0.8197301608987043
The combined histological and microcomputed analysis of human iliac crest biopsies leads to major advances in our understanding of three-dimensional bone architecture.	0.42775174992470755
Microcomputed tomography avoids the time-consuming reconstruction and artifacts of serial sections.	0.4096700624690719
Furthermore, its high resolution allows the recording of structural differences as low as 10 mm.	0.5290107263903369
Thus, three-dimensional analysis in combination with histological evaluation of cellular dynamics facilitates earlier and easier recording of changes of cancellous bone.	0.5084538386144983
The aneurysmal bone cyst represents a tumorlike lesion, which does not occur frequently.	0.5183696715985683
Every site of the skeleton may be involved.	0.6186643208406052
Although it can be observed at any age, it distinctly predominates from 10 to 20 years of age.	0.7333633474656345
Distinction of aneurysmatic bone cysts from certain benign or malignant bone tumours requires subtle imaging techniques and an experienced bone tumour pathologist.	0.4220015478349283
Since the lesion shows a heterogeneous biological behaviour and typically occurs in the growing skeleton, a wide range of surgical procedures must be provided concerning tumour resection and defect reconstruction.	0.637188423865733
In the current retrospective study results of 41 surgically treated aneurysmal bone cysts, thereof 5 latent, 31 active, and 5 aggressive lesions, were investigated.	0.7208220817089434
While morbidity due to the therapeutic measures was comparatively low even in extended lesions and demanding reconstructions, a recurrence rate of 19.5% had to be observed in our series.	0.7387347331314271
Taking into consideration the biological activity of the lesion, analysis of the recurrences revealed inappropriate surgical margins had been chosen at the primary operation in all of these patients.	0.7133961775296115
Since the risk of a local relapse is linked both to aggressiveness of the primary lesion and to surgical radicality, therapy of aneurysmal bone cyst requires preoperative staging and stage-dependent surgical procedures.	0.6432863160539053
The RS3PE syndrome (Remitting Seronegative Symmetrical Synovitis with Pitting Edema) is a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis in the elderly with a good prognosis.	0.6274901707439496
It usually presents as an acute, symmetric polysynovitis with edema of the dorsum of the hands and feet.	0.3928193046106256
Anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids leads to prompt improvement.	0.46401026829001035
We describe the case of an 81 year old man with a primarily unilateral manifestation involving the right hand.	0.6964993003797667
A thrombosis of the axillary vein was suspected.	0.46651309942505775
Within a few days he developed a pitting edema of the dorsum of the other hand.	0.695844721255933
Movement of both shoulders and wrists was painful.	0.3690652253829159
Low-dose corticosteroid therapy resulted in a rapid improvement of the edema and the inflammatory symptoms.	0.7015066135716734
The objective of this study was to determine the usefulness, safety and acceptance of a new technique of percutaneous implantation of port-catheter-systems (PIPS) for locoregional intraarterial chemotherapy of the liver.	0.724679031167423
From October 1994 to July 1996, 128 patients (30 women, 98 men) participated in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program (phase II).	0.5868983207590969
Our objectives were to demonstrate risk-factor modification and increased work-load capacity resulting directly from the rehabilitation in terms of primary results and long-term effects, 6 months (n = 59) and 12 months (n = 30) after termination of the program.	0.7009586690473879
We observed how many of the patients were able to be occupationally re-integrated after completion of phase II rehabilitation.	0.6514117550662116
Here, we present the so-called "Vollmer retractor", which can be fixed on to the operating table.	0.7677689083003963
It allows an optimal transference of the traction force on to the border of the wound, both in upper and lower abdominal interventions.	0.5844144369425094
In this way, as shown by our recent experience, we gain an optimal view of the subdiaphragmatic area and into the small pelvis.	0.7191658129860141
The disaster management in Germany is embodied in the constitution.	0.46702002972015255
According to the German constitution the ministries of the interior of the federal states coordinate the disaster management by delegating it to the city and county administrations.	0.4564510663406531
These elaborate and update a special disaster management calendar, which allows a prompt flow of information to and from the administration and the person in charge of operations and guarantees a smooth collaboration on which the success of the operation depends.	0.622471069824141
The American-European Consensus Conference recently recommended the following criteria for diagnosis of ARDS: (1) acute onset; (2) PaO2/FiO2<=200 mmHg regardless of PEEP level; (3) bilateral infiltrates seen on frontal chest radiograph; (4) PCWP <= 18 mmHg when measured or no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension.	0.5593982032566355
Pathophysiologically, ARDS is characterized by pulmonary edema owing to injury of the capillary-alveolar membranes and increased pulmonary artery pressure.	0.46881357638198623
It is further distinguished by severe hypoxemia unresponsive to the usual methods of support for respiratory failure.	0.41341990099995046
Hypoxemia is caused by intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting due to to persistent perfusion of non-ventilated alveoli.	0.4129539118887678
Another characteristic feature in ARDS is the low thoracopulmonary compliance.	0.4216426362062515
Latest studies suggest that the incidence of the syndrome is in the range of 3-10 cases / 100,000 inhabitants / year.	0.8401347162701669
Mortality rates are a major concern: old and new reports continue to report mortality rates of 50-60%.	0.5312502659777402
Thoracic organ transplantation has evolved as standard therapy in end-stage cardiac and pulmonary failure.	0.508845823744713
Meanwhile more than 50.000 heart, 2500 heart-lung and 10.000 lung transplantations have been performed worldwide.	0.592836966591468
Improvements in patient selection as well as in the postoperative management have led to 1-year survival rates of 70-90%.	0.8428915255817521
Long-term results are still influenced by the development of graft vessels disease, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and malignancies.	0.6340651732203842
Furthermore, indications and results of different procecures will be presented and new developments discussed.	0.6063755767825219
The paper focuses on the cultural history of brain death in Germany in the second half of the 20th century.	0.6404848060644419
It analyzes scientific and public discourses on the relevance of brain death and the importance of medical innovations in intensive care medicine.	0.48131794585880344
The paper examines how the public reacted when heart transplantation led to an urgent need for a new definition of death.	0.5297954406286233
It will be shown how the concept of brain death was accepted by the public, introduced into clinical routine, and implemented through medical and legal policies.	0.6543204455962103
Finally, it will be analyzed why the public consensus on brain death was definitely questioned in the last ten years.	0.7078234226230972
An understanding of the use of the concept of brain death by scientists, lawyers, theologians, and the public during the last three decades may help to shed light on the social role of science in modern and late-modern societies.	0.658293257735353
Background: In the course of Graves' disease (GD) the extraocular muscles become fibrotic after an acute inflammatory stage.	0.6281065987566069
Differentiation of these two stages is important for therapy.	0.7810009712053411
Injuries of the joints of the pelvis and of the acetabulum are still a problem even today.	0.9063586603389757
When the joints of the pelvis are damaged the risk of complicated pelvic injuries, that is to say pelvic injuries with damage to the soft tissues in and around the pelvis, is increased threefold.	0.6888592764421659
The lethality, the overall gravity of the injuries, the probability of haemorrhagic complications and the proportion of associated pelvic injuries are also increased.	0.6706050835299242
Even when anatomical reconstruction of the lower limb girdle is achieved, long-term secondary conditions such as pain and genitourinary and neurological scquelae frequently persist.	0.5835282034943604
Complicated pelvic injuries, i. e. pelvic injury with concomitant damage to organs and soft tissues in the pelvis and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femoral fracture (floating hip) are special cases.	0.6019880242158594
Haemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the treatment of organic lesions must be the first priorities in the interdisciplinary therapy.	0.795134518317162
Even when these priorities are correctly observed, the lethality is almost three times as high as in the case of pelvic injuries not involving soft-tissue damage.	0.5798836749323746
Acetabular fractures are a particular challenge even compared with other joint fractures.	0.4204687979928509
Operative treatment with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has been shown to have the best results.	0.6789514118755826
In addition to the type of fracture and the personal experience of the surgeon concerned, such fracture-specific factors as the presence of further fractures of the posterior wall, comminuted fractures, joint depression fractures and intra-articular fragments increasingly play a part.	0.7479565744499282
The long-term result worsens with increasing number of these additional pathologies.	0.628138455947341
The primary cartilaginous damage caused by the accident seems to have a considerable influence on the long-term result following acetabular fractures.	0.7109256465762449
Two-dimensional conventional X-rays and computer tomographic imaging systems contribute to the diagnosis and surgical planning of patients with orofacial malformations.	0.8068037826038268
The ability to reformat CT scans into three-dimensional osseous and soft tissue surface images has a significant impact on the diagnosis and management of orofacial malformations.	0.5896053001576066
Cephalometric evaluation with teleradiography provides precise insight into both the skeletal structures and the soft parts, enabling the radiologist to assess the relationship among the different parts in a given subject, at any given time and in relation to the normal.	0.6109204948496315
The purpose of this study was to check the precision of the Dräger vaporizer model 19.3 when filled with three different preparations of isoflurane.	0.5367602950759698
Background: Since there is no epidemiologic assessment of the frequency of pain caused by tumor in Germany, tumor-pain-prevalence is estimated indirectly on the basis of mortality and median survival.	0.6411513983395892
Knowing that about 50% of all patients having metastases or incurable locoregional recurrence suffer from pain every day, the product of median survival times mortality was calculated to achieve the number of patients' days with tumor-caused pain per year (82.710.690 days in Germany 1995).	0.6139923974488151
By division with 365 (days), it is calculated that 226.605 patients require tumor pain related treatment at one day in Germany.	0.4679489324432593
Another calculation based on Bonica's publications that 60-90% of patients suffering from advanced cancer are having pain and based on an estimated tumor prevalence 1989/90 revealed a tumor pain prevalence of 221.826.	0.5066841730957892
Laser catheters which run eccentrically on a guide wire were developed for maximization of luminal gain by excimer laser angioplasty (ELCA).	0.3708758883779495
We investigated the safety and efficacy of ELCA with these new catheters plus PTCA in patients with restenoses or occlusions in coronary stents.	0.4643959445899919
The age of standardized instrumented scoliosis correction and stabilization began with Harrington instrumentation (HI).	0.37688130932984737
With HI, satisfactory long-term correction of the frontal plane averaged approximately 50 %, but without notable derotational capabilities.The distraction of the concavity leads to reduction of the sagittal contour of the spine (flat back), which is biomechanically disadvantageous.	0.7002863676776397
The newer multisegmentally attached implant systems avoid this disadvantage.	0.22427430939225107
The first prototypes of these systems were Luque- (SSI) and Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation.	0.672502354578241
Ideal indications for posterior instrumented curve correction are structural idiopathic double major curves and flexible single curves.	0.2913986345706035
However, even with these newer doublerod systems derotation is low, because derotation is, without any doubt, related to anterior release and thus decoupling of the segments by means of disc resection.	0.6483146154020644
Autoaggressive syndromes as causes of diseases underlying chronic blepharitis and keratoconjunctivitis that are refractory to treatment are often difficult to recognize.	0.4138691149160584
The surgical correction of a tandem stenosis of the carotid artery is sometimes difficult, especially if the second stenosis is near or above the skull base.	0.6975643018835156
Angioplasty and Stent implantation may offer an alternative to standard surgical procedures in the treatment of carotid stenoses in the future.	0.6593096164529397
However, the potential advantages of these endovascular techniques warrant continued evaluation.	0.7120263465218651
The application of these techniques in carotid artery tandem stenoses presents specific problems and dangers.	0.5608834736766213
We discuss the case of a 78-year-old man with severe carotid stenoses on both sides and an additional symptomatic tandem stenosis above the skull base on the right side.	0.6588462406199631
After the surgical correction of the left carotid artery using standard endarterectomy, we performed endarterectomy on the right side in combination with an open Stent implantation.	0.8727890536696241
The periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis are also known as Koenen tumors.	0.368883599360622
Joannes Henricus Maria Koenen was born on March 10, 1893, in Eindhoven and died in Bois-le-Duc May 29, 1956.	0.41002872744303814
From 1910 to 1918 he studied medicine at the University of Amsterdam.	0.35273121406722496
Then he worked as a physician at the "Coudewater" asylum in Rosmalen and from 1929 in the "Voorburg" asylum in Vught.	0.4103760723928848
In 1932 he published his publication concerning a family with tuberous sclerosis in which photographs of periungual fibromas are shown.	0.31882600507513764
His thesis in 1933 at the University in Leiden was titled "Imbecility in children.	0.37729330930245064
Its Importance in pedagogic and social regard, by reason of an investigation in some communities in Noord-Brabant".	0.47345588402048233
Later he was appointed director of a state mental institution.	0.31068815728396965
The periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis were first described by Richad Kothe in Munich in 1903.	0.3126450179661684
Parallel with the increasing number of coronary stent implantation procedures, new or more elaborate coronary stents were introduced into clinical use almost every month in 1996.	0.5643647202515389
We have studied the architecture, surface-morphology, and shape-conversion of 16 different coronary stent systems.	0.566039759815801
The objective of our study was to detect possible specific design and surface features which might influence the healing process, instent restenosis, and stent thrombosis.	0.5885956738081153
Using electron microscopy we found ultrasmooth surfaces on 5 stents.	0.2654347401175307
All other coronary stents revealed individually varying and partly sharp-edged surface irregularities.	0.3129412902170578
Video-based morphometry showed covering between 8.3% and 26.4%.	0.6622387850431442
Stent shortening after in-vitro expansion ranged from 0% up to 10.5% of the initial stent length.	0.7954198429479736
In some stent systems balloon dilation lead to over-expansion of the stent margaine.	0.43374382882795387
This over-expansion mounted up to 20% of the balloon diameter and the stents revealed a rather biconcave than homogenous expansion pattern.	0.5252461563142566
This phenomenon was also found after postmortal stent implantation in 20 autopsied hearts.	0.5325797411479102
Unilateral hearing loss (HL) caused by an acoustic neuroma (AN) is regarded to be neural ("non-cochlear").	0.5848223131751503
By using otoacoustic emissions it is possible to prove concurrent sensory (cochlear) HL.	0.45047468325577067
We prefer distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) because these are more frequency-specific and stable.	0.4252767753799805
From April 1994 to May 1996, we examined preoperatively 24 patients with radiologically proven AN.	0.6681388135211435
Pure-tone audiometry, DP-grams, brainstem-evoked response audiometry (BERA) and vestibular studies were performed in all cases, while special auditory tests (Fowler, Carhart) and short increment sensitivity indices were also performed in 12 cases.	0.625307618860118
BERA was pathological in 23 cases and latencies were borderline in one case.	0.44416852496863524
After comparing audiograms and DP-grams we found 13 patients with sensory HL, 4 patients with combined sensorineural HL and 7 patients with neural HL.	0.5894598025101425
There was a strong correlation between the results of DPOAE and the results of special auditory test (=0.63) whereas there was no correlation between tumor size and cochlear function.	0.7089715372849688
The result showed that the typical HL caused by AN was a combined sensorineural loss.	0.655615969473242
DPOAE were not suited for the detection of AN but were able to give exact information about any remaining cochlear function.	0.44128165080885123
The monoclonal dominant malignant T cells in mycosis fungoides (MF) carry identical TCR rearrangements.	0.338329001964688
Their detection is a useful diagnostic tool.	0.5205773402980922
Thus, in routine diagnosis we investigated the occurrence of monoclonal T cells in skin biopsy samples of MF-patients by TCR-PCR, followed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE).	0.560337755605167
In 188 out of 208 MF patients, at least one skin sample with sufficient DNA quality for PCR analysis was obtained.	0.539272987289182
Applying a consensus PCR for the TCR genes VI and J 1/2, we detected monoclonal T cells in 122 cases (65%).	0.5762031853731775
In the remaining 66 cases, we performed two multiplex-PCRs, covering rearrangements of the other TCR genes.	0.7437274413369322
Here we found in 11 cases (6%) predominant clonal rearrangements of VII-IV and J 1/2 and in 2 (1%) those of VI-IV and J P1/2.	0.7789640842174355
In patients with MF, detecting rearrangements of only VI and J 1/2 is sufficient for PCR screening analysis.	0.45413187429888546
In 53 of the patients (28%) the applied methods revealed no monoclonal T cells.	0.7009800195761655
This may be due to a low cell number, oligoclonal nature, chromosomal abberations or remaining of TCR in germline configuration.	0.45218105501664146
Despite significant improvements in early detection of hearing losses in children, a relatively long interval still exists from initial concern by families to definite audiological identification.	0.4814191147766066
The aim of our retrospective cross-sectional study was to identify parental factors contributing to the delay of early detection.	0.7249099442191231
The parents of 70 hearing-impaired children were interviewed.	0.3471935776872502
All children were fitted with hearing aids in our clinical and had no additional physical or cognitive disabilities.	0.5423738582182326
At an average age of 19.5 months, parents or family doctors noticed first signs of a possible hearing impairment.	0.7205067960142207
On average it then took an additional 7.2 months until hearing impairment was diagnosed by an expert and the necessary first steps taken for rehabilitation (fitting of hearing aids).	0.5503268613962892
Significantly, total hearing loss or profound hearing impairments were detected earlier than mild or moderate hearing impairments.	0.41890634158114015
In addition to hearing loss, parental education correlated significantly with an earlier start of rehabilitation.	0.5147390191404505
Statistical analysis revealed that children with hearing-impaired close relatives as well as first-born children tended to be diagnosed later.	0.594800856550564
To further improve secondary prevention of hearing loss, the competence of specific parental groups should be taken into consideration.	0.5723560000213057
After the incidental puncture of a sidebranch of the thyreocervical trunk during a subclavian vein catheterization, a symptomatic av-fistula developped.	0.45811134499816214
The diagnosis was confirmed by angiography.	0.4217634444839152
Using a microcatheter system the fistula was occluded with microcoils.	0.36085306559077535
This prospective study was designed to compare quality of life, life satisfaction, and subjective ratings of health before and at variable time intervals after heart transplantation (HTx).	0.5934150149895909
175 patients were included between February 1994 and December 1997.	0.6045938476909737
Every six months before and 1,5, 3, 6, and 12 months after HTx, they received the following standardized and validated questionnaires: German SF 36, heart failure and specific transplant symptom list, global quality of life assessment, Munich life quality dimension list, expected/experienced life changes after HTx, good command of the German language, and a minimum age of 18 years.	0.7903402489465687
During data evaluation, median (Me), mean (M), and standard deviation (SD) were created from individual parameters.	0.7122656946247599
Quality of life was rated as very poor by 84% of patients with congestive heart failure.	0.6961269483441983
Only 6 weeks after HTx, 74% rated their quality of life as significantly better.	0.5850265475186611
Before HTx 80% were very unsatisfied about their health status and 87% about physical performance.	0.5411703109828094
Six weeks after HTx, this parameter improved significantly and 76% were very satisfied about their health status and 50% about physical performance.	0.6348993374267176
While somatic changes expected before HTx corresponded well with experienced ones, psychological improvements were smaller than expected, but one year after HTx they were significant (before: M=3.66; SD=0.9; Range (R)=3.78 vs 12 months postop: M=4.61; SD=0.6; R=2.67; p<0.05).	0.494611474834009
Quality of life correlated before HTx best with subjectively rated health (r=0.61, p<0.01) and 6 months after with satisfaction about health status (r=0.76, p<0.01).	0.5480914318502572
Only in 25% were expected improvements fulfilled regarding sexual activity/satisfaction, professional situation, and recreational activities.	0.6197944694911776
90% of posttransplant patients reported physical compaints, most by effects of immunsuppression, but were coping well.	0.6968423013941154
The study shows that already 6 weeks after successful HTx all quality of life parameters improved significantly.	0.5758949669828813
Despite some unfulfilled expectations and complaints, the postoperative life situation of HTx patients appeared significantly improved.	0.4858426045997229
Sevoflurane is a "new" volatile inhaled anaesthetic.	0.4921046426125102
Owing to its lower blood-gas solubility coefficient, emergence from anaesthesia is faster with sevoflurane than with isoflurane, enflurane, or halothane.	0.5405489182273601
Sevoflurane undergoes metabolic biodegradation, releasing inorganic fluoride ions that could produce nephrotoxicity.	0.26418469672973305
In this study, we compared serum inorganic fluoride concentrations (IFCs) in patients receiving either sevoflurane or enflurane.	0.7803411172963489
Furthermore, indices of renal function were evaluated until the 3rd postoperative day.	0.4549500052241914
Background: Rarely, an additional Brown's syndrome develops spontaneously in cases of posttraumatic bilateral superior oblique palsy.	0.6129517194745078
Surgical measures are controversial and problematic.	0.27645761569124677
Metastasis formation is a multistep process that requires tumor cells to progress through many different stages.	0.41774115558165986
One of the first steps is a disturbance of the epithelial integrity through a decrease in intercellular homotypic adhesion.	0.7462152334053884
Proteolysis of the extracellular matrix, as well as increased locomotion, leads to intravasation and dissemination of the tumor cells.	0.6044279285702597
In the target organs metastasizing cells adhere to the endothelium, extravasate and form metastases.	0.3759263531162118
Finally, neoangiogenesis is required for the initiation as well as the growth of the metastases, providing the tumor cells with both nutritive agents and growth factors.	0.7322449602083348
This leads to the conclusion that anti-proteolytic and anti-angiogenic substances could provide effective therapeutic approaches for the control of metastatic growth.	0.5391932589087323
Whether or not this goal can be accomplished by synthetic or endogenous drugs must still be demonstrated by basic and definitive clinical research.	0.5010476067115945
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to present our experience and results with arthroscopic resection of the acromioclavicular joint.	0.7015324232746183
Urodynamic examinations were performed in 82 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer before and after radical prostatectomy.	0.6384761850874033
A significant decrease in bladder capacity (396 ml to 331.9 ml), urethral closure pressure (89.6 cm H2O to 65.,2 cm H2O) and functional profile length (61 mm to 25.9 mm) was noted.	0.8091059459182132
The continence rate after radical prostatectomy was 33.4 % after 1 month, 69.4 % after 3 months, 84.7 % after 6 months, and 90.9 % after 12 months, respectively.	0.8657347181270725
A correlation was found between urethral closure pressure and functional profile length and continence.	0.474407590493827
A second urodynamic examination was performed 6 months after radical prostatectomy.	0.5510257651627589
Functional profile length and urethral closure pressure increased.	0.3596747119763182
These data suggest that restoration of continence is based on sphincteric parameters.	0.4513591072739121
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound with biological tissue with regard to cancer therapy.	0.5651752531030204
The physical and biological aspects of this are reviewed and summarized in this paper.	0.7217781793020827
The preliminary results give reason to hope, as ultrasound is easy to focuse and might be applicable as a supplementary therapeutic technique in ultrasound-accessible tumors.	0.5226047479916784
The changes observed in biological studies are clearly a function of the pyhsical parameters.	0.4053936808195064
Therefore, it is possible to calculate and predict the biological effects.	0.7107397460512938
Recent results have shown the potential of magnetic resonance imaging in monitoring ultrasound therapy online.	0.6595647816950785
The capability of MRI to measure temperature will be an important tool for the safe and reliable application of this new therapeutic approach.	0.7532498569852245
The role of ultrasound therapy in the management of human tumors must be clarified in carefully conducted clinical trials.	0.4896254937518214
Posttraumatic deformities after pediatric fractures are either the result of incomplete or failed remodeling, complete or partial stimulation of the growth plates, or complete or partial closure of a growth plate.	0.6438186591058614
In contrast to fractures of the upper extremities, spontaneous remodeling should not be intentionally integrated in the treatment algorithm.	0.8330729605164836
In the context of the quality assurance program of the German pension insurance institutions, instruments and procedures have been developed in the past few years in order to assess the quality of structure, process, and results of inpatient rehabilitation, as well as patient satisfaction.	0.8197770940698037
The routine implementation of these procedures aims at providing rehabilitation hospitals with fast information on shortcomings in their current practice, so that concepts of treatment and - in the long run - effects of rehabilitation can be systematically improved.	0.7259067471359799
When the "quality profiles" of rehabilitation hospitals are compared ("benchmarking"), paying institutions of rehabilitation could gain information on the cost-quality-ratio of particular hospitals as well as important leads for improving the steering processes of patients and hospitals.	0.6678740513392464
In the present article, results of a first "field-run" of the procedures for measuring patient satisfaction and quality of rehabilitation processes are reported.	0.8831044231690159
A comparative analysis of patient satisfaction in four orthopaedic/rheumatologic rehabilitation hospitals showed high degrees of overall satisfaction in all hospitals.	0.4090423729188435
In several subdimensions of patient satisfaction, however, significant differences between hospitals were found.	0.5895471009556077
Quality of rehabilitation processes - as assessed by a standardized peer-review - varied substantially between 36 hospitals.	0.6906456907457973
Problems of quality were found especially in some dimensions that must be considered as crucial for rehabilitation, e.g., in the history and diagnosis of disabilities, in the consideration of psycho-social problems, or in the assessment of occupational capacities.	0.8006469431065015
The analysis of THR-failures showed that the acetabular component still is the main problem of total hip replacement.	0.7389035616483041
The acetabular cup fails more often than the stem.	0.3826498518855702
In the midterm analysis the failure rate is a little bit higher in cementless than in cement fixed cups.	0.5111203904005865
The known effect that the failure rate of cups fixed with cement increases exponentially 8 to 10 years after implantation, could of course not be seen in this study.	0.6491088188538876
The success of the cementless fixation was negatively influenced by the diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis, age over 70 and the fixation manner: the failure rate of threaded cups was higher than the one of pressfit cups although the Zweymüller-cup as well as the Link type V-cup showed good results.	0.6245644962241023
The midterm results of the stem were very good for the cementless as for the cemented technique.	0.5279478741585512
Some implants showed compared to others significantly worse results.	0.32437998043675254
The further implantation should be thought of, what partially has already happened.	0.4075650043370302
The results of cementless stem fixation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthrosis and dysplastic osteoarthritis is comparable, so that cementless fixation should be thought of in case of adequate conditions (ability of partial weight bearing for some weeks, age under 60).	0.5607292784037071
Type I and type II diabetes are the most common types of diabetes.	0.7957868795808443
The ratio of type I to type II diabetes is about 1:9.	0.6300781987155503
Type I diabetes is caused by an absolute insulin deficiency and is therefore referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes.The disease becomes manifest clinically in childhood or adolescence ("juvenile diabetes"), although manifestation in adulthood is being increasingly observed.	0.6408744958234734
Morphologically, a subtotal ( > 80 %) to total loss of beta cells in the pancreatic islets occurs.	0.7973513857404284
Lymphocytic insulitis, which disappears after the beta cells have been totally destroyed, is pathognomonic of type I diabetes.	0.6216190343946029
This insulitis is an expression of an autoimmune event that is triggered by a multitude of factors.	0.4494916357213738
An important factor appears to be a genetic predisposition (HLA DR3/DR4/DQ8) in connection with as yet unknown environmental factors (e. g., viruses).	0.6131007038023757
Autoantibodies, such as islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies (ICA), insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and/or autoantibodies to the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid carboxylase (GAD), are already detectable in a prediabetic phase, although it is not possible to predict the time of clinical manifestion.	0.6142727148244538
The course of the disease is dependent on age.	0.9380295213114597
Young children require insulin therapy sooner than juveniles or adults.	0.23999469297932147
This article summarizes data from recent studies on the prevalence, diagnosis and therapy of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children.	0.8845293168380622
The prevalence of this disorder in 4-6 year old children is 0.7%.	0.7997726271692205
Leading clinical sign in 90% of patients is habitual snoring, but this is rather nonspecific, as 60% of patients investigated for habitual snoring do not have OSAS.	0.8869329137327964
Other signs such as daytime sleepiness, failure to thrive, profuse nocturnal sweating or mouth breathing are equally nonspecific.	0.33105193040419656
The diagnosis, therefore, has to be confirmed by polysomnography, where OSAS is suggested by the occurrence of >5 obstructive apneas/hypopneas per hour of sleep in conjunction with a CO2 of >50 mmHg for >8% of sleep time and/or >1 desaturation to <=90%/h.	0.7805843683115914
Patients with progressive cancer and their families face a series of existential crises with each stage of disease up to terminal stages in which palliative treatment is begun, and patients come to accept the inevitability of death.	0.5587288031067997
This can lead to a unique, highly emotional situation with direct or indirect, open or hidden, varied and very personal manifestations.	0.4757677345791125
The dermatological clinic in Homburg was founded in 1945.	0.26130271114381315
In 1947 it was integrated into the Saarland University as a dermatology department.	0.3510243641504706
A review of the history of the clinic documents advances and challenges in clinical dermatology, as well as new developments in related basic research during the last 50 years.	0.6040166984448596
The coexistence of carotid artery stenosis with coronary artery disease occurs in a small percentage of patients requiring open heart surgical procedures.	0.7102193879607791
Whether the combined surgical approach favorably influences the outcome of patients requiring major cardiac operations remains controversial.	0.5337807703525649
We report the successful thrombectomy of the internal carotid artery.	0.5528665515647307
A 33-year-old woman suffered from ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome after treatment with FSH/HCG for in-vitro fertilization.	0.599544549291115
She developed a transient left hemiparesis.	0.2955956346948697
This was caused by a floating thrombus located in the internal carotid artery.	0.5175947886310769
Open surgical treatment with thrombectomy prevents recurrent neurological symptoms.	0.4219695584036255
The development of hand eczema is a relatively commonly seem dermatosis in housewives.	0.461896266940211
In 1986 we presented a first survey of potential contact dermatitis sources for a housewife.	0.39616068986025577
Now, we present an update in which we analyse the different contact sources in the household and grade them in comparison to the data of 1986.	0.6889990386537536
The results are based on the analysis of a large population of 2633 patients with the occupation "housewife" and the diagnosis "eczema" who have been seen in departments of dermatology belonging to the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK).	0.7334353099209175
Data for HIV infection on transmission probabilities per contact are of widely differing quality.	0.319110258083988
Estimates of infection probabilities after sexual exposures are the most problematic, even though sexual exposure is the most frequent transmission risk.	0.7235936712274875
Extrapolations of data from discordant couple cohort studies and from US seroincidence studies may be seriously biased.	0.31521829131769796
Infectivity of and susceptibility to HIV may be influenced by concomitant STDs, antiretroviral therapy, alloimmunization and/or subinfectious virus exposures and thus may show a wide range of inter- and intraindividual variability.	0.5279121548476283
Differences in factors influencing transmission probability of HIV most likely outweigh differences in sexual behaviour in explaining the differences in epidemic spread of HIV.	0.45274135691694034
Between January 1989 and March 1997, 175 patients with traumatic shoulder dislocations were treated by conservative means (median age 41 years, 39 F, 136 M).	0.6237527720830314
In 78 patients (17 F, 61 M) a clinical and radiological follow up (median 50 months, range 6-106) could be obtained.	0.8726661400565
Additionally, a diagnostic ultrasound was carried out in all patients.	0.8059176661501952
The recurrence rate in the group younger than 30 years (G < 30; n = 35) was 86 %; in the group older than 30 years (G > 30; n = 43) it was 21 % (P < 0.05).	0.8300442545501125
Persisting neurological deficits were found in 6 patients (8 %).	0.6962921037098961
According to the Rowe score, 16 patients (46 %) of the G < 30 achieved excellent or good results, in the G > 30, 29 patients (67 %).	0.8671145443960697
In 17 % of cases, a glenohumeral arthrosis was diagnosed be radiological means.	0.6311954599087687
18 % had radiological signs of a previous fracture of the greater tuberosity.	0.7437970425339002
Hill-Sachs lesions were identified in 19 % of cases.	0.6649595006111259
Rotator cuff tears were diagnosed in 9 % by ultrasound.	0.7335899091431232
No relationship between the duration of immobilization and the recurrence rate was found (P = 0.95).	0.6398666032711509
The recurrence rate following primary shoulder dislocation depends primarily on the patients' age.	0.6021459006041467
We analyzed quality assurance protocol records of 532 geriatric hospital patients in comparison to an administration database concerning data on "length of stay" information (LOS).	0.49092020410766407
Doctors handwritten quality assurance protocol records corresponded in 74.25% of cases to administration data.	0.5976621305740579
14.47% of cases were registered with different LOS; 11.28% of LOS information was missing.	0.7910571879450902
The increasing amount of documentation tasks in German geriatric hospitals is discussed.	0.3536152991353351
Conclusion: We assume that not only discrete well known information (admission and discharge dates, LOS) are contaminated by documentation failure but also data on functional status of geriatric patients which may have important influence on external data processing.	0.6032689222227
The majority of patients with symptomatic spondylolysis can be treated conservatively.	0.7965057001661048
Only when symptoms persist in spite of conservative treatment surgery may be indicated.	0.5091991226270346
In young patients, however, fusion of a mobile segment should be avoided, but a direct repair of the pars defect can be attempted.	0.7473598900079305
This procedure allows complete healing and possibly avoids degeneration of the intervertebral disk.	0.448388301391699
For this purpose Morscher developed the hook screw, which connects the arch with the anterior articular process.	0.5585647438572356
It allows compression of the defect without crossing the defect with the screw.	0.5379589336703802
A follow-up study of the first 33 patients with a follow-up time of 3.5 years on average showed a good subjective result in 79 % of the patients.	0.9974026111624946
In patients younger than 20 years of age, however, the result was good in 87.5 % of cases.	0.7204330802739236
The reason for the better results in young patients is that in older patients the origin of the pain is often not the pars defect, but the degeneration of the intervertebral disk.	0.8662502803291509
Direct repair of spondylolysis is therefore indicated when pain persists after 6 months of conservative treatment or there is a progressive olisthesis of not more than 10 mm.	0.6474516091131244
After the end of growth an MRI study of the intervertebral discs should show whether there is degeneration or not.	0.5888315132303091
Direct repair is indicated only in the absence of disc degeneration.	0.5915306220254773
After the age of 25 years this procedure should not be carried out.	0.6099922630972809
We are presenting a 47-year-old woman who was stung by jellyfish while bathing in the sea of Thailand.	0.46630759854182874
Immediately after the injury she developed sharp pain and urticarial erythema of the skin of the knees accompanied by muscle cramps of the entire body.	0.6491142234075168
After a few days a toxic contact dermatitis with edematous swelling and ulcerations developed, which did not respond to topical antibiotics or corticosteroids.	0.5556872112948942
Three weeks later the patient presented with a disseminated urticarial eruption, which at first responded well to topical treatment and systemic corticosteroids.	0.7192264561247839
Over the next few weeks, however, a relapse of the eruption and the ulcerations occurred.	0.6015020108391526
Raised titres of IgG and IgM antibodies against different jellyfish from the Indian and Pacific Ocean were detected in the patient's serum by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.	0.4921504158025863
Antibodies against bees (class 1) and wasps (class 4) were found by the radioallergosorbent test.	0.7686953436764945
The clinical features and the immunological findings led to the diagnosis of toxic and allergic contact dermatitis to jellyfish venom.	0.6564561677857069
First aid and secondary treatment of jellyfish injuries are suggested.	0.31306046458496867
The design of controlled clinical trials on prevention and therapy of arrhythmic events is a difficult task.	0.5892017888711529
In particular in ICD trials, false estimations and omissions have occured that can compromise the interpretation of a trial.	0.5101185510003764

Evaluation of the weaknesses of completed antiarrhythmic trials.	0.36801380743997014
Problems in the specification of indications and in the estimation of the effective sample size cannot be solved by the inclusion of mixed populations but require the establishment of development programs.	0.5849384540782685
Further crucial points are the appropriate choice of control and the identical concomittant treatment and observation of the groups to be compared.	0.5350164415499902
Technical mistakes as imprecise definitions, arbitrary decisions during the course or at termination of a trial, unclear responsibilities or an unscheduled flow of information can be avoided if these potential problems are anticipated in the trial protocol.	0.55588953584154
A prospective approach that anticipates problems at the time the study protocol is drafted is preferable to a reluctant reactive approach during the course of the trial.	0.6078881528533281
Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality after kidney transplantation.	0.4838627727160853
Its general availability and the absence of radiation exposure and discomfort for the patient also make it a suitable procedure for follow-up.	0.5949055847728706
Simple B-mode sonography provides comprehensive information on the morphology of the renal transplant and surrounding structures, while color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) additionally allows assessment of the anastomoses and organ perfusion.	0.5903004487483197
More recent technical advances such as power Doppler ultrasound appear to improve in particular the assessment of peripheral circulation.	0.4372000522341538
The possibilities and limitations of the various sonographic techniques in the evaluation of kidney transplants are discussed with special reference to the most important clinical aspects and some basic technical concepts.	0.7302579792746262

The operative realignment of mechanical axis deviations (MAD) is necessary to prevent early joint degeneration and to reach normal load-bearing.	0.562934672865419
Modern types of external fixation systems allow an alignment of the mechanical axis to exact degrees.	0.46640308229216504
Predominantly this are corrections of angular deformities.	0.24297500549376502
In some cases the analysis of the MAD does not show any angular deformity, but a parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines of a bone.	0.7196679009156186
Such parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines is defined as a translation deformity of the bone.	0.5698635793535956
In combined deformities with angulation and translation the centre of deformity can be established proximal or distal out of the limit of the bone.	0.5637956002919381
In translation deformities the realignment of the mechanical axis requires a parallel re-staggering made by a translation-osteotomy or by a counterangulated double osteotomy.	0.4294797796886546
In complex deformities with angulation and translation, the translation requires a separate corrective planning.	0.4591877447292136
By using external fixator systems to perform acute or progressive corrective osteotomies the position of the Axis of Correction of Angulation (ACA) in relation to the n-CORA of the deformity has to be considered.	0.6405394878083276
If ACA position is not conform with the n-CORA position relevant geometric effects in relation of length and translation occur.	0.4190700102077897
These geometric effects to corrective osteotomies can be calculated by using simple trigonometric formulas or graphical methods.	0.35490673941975903
Possibilities to compensate translation and length effects are shown by using unilateral external fixator systems.	0.4364196528215765
The employers' liability insurance association for victuallers and licensed victuallers has been controlling healing procedures with the aid of a computer program for several years.	0.379801386041122
The personal data of the injured patient and the precise diagnosis of the injury are used to prepare a forecast of the duration of the treatment and of the patient's inability to work.	0.9775991749459875
The basis of this forecast is provided by tables integrated in the program, which have been elaborated by experts on trauma medicine and also constantly refined by them.	0.6650349650658965
Meanwhile numerous insurance companies concerned with accidents and trauma have acquired the program and are intending to use it.	0.35697255033416525
The objective is a national database on trauma medicine covering the whole of Germany.	0.363257961956828
It is intended that its evaluation will help to guarantee the quality of concomitant treatment of trauma victims and also yield some indications on how best to realize the networking of institutions concerned with acute treatment and rehabilitation.	0.4767988840337445
Stroke and its consequences are under medical, sociologic and socioeconomic aspects one of the biggest contemporary challenges.	0.46115887512861065
Due to the demographic development the importance of this disease will further increase.	0.6341450590003236
Nonetheless acute therapy of ischemic stroke up to now was marked by therapeutic nihilism and adherence to empiric therapeutic procedures.	0.48172765876120494
Only the admission of rt-Pa in the USA in 1996 for the systemic thrombolysis in ischemic insults less then 3 hours old led to a change in therapeutic strategies.	0.5709757662618806
The good profit-risk-ratio of early thrombolysis with rt-Pa could be confirmed by further studies lately.	0.5574728438858837
In the meantime this therapy was officially recommended by the AHA in the importance of grade A recommendation.	0.44922114207104097
In Europe thrombolysis is equally promoted as the procedure of choice.	0.4208226819376593
At present only few patients receive such a treatment.	0.41083662933142645
A thrombolytic therapy can only be provided by a minority of centers due to high requirement in infra-structure.	0.4833507152145477
Furthermore clinic admission often appears with immense loss of time.	0.2239509231359239
Unfortunately also within the clinics there are relevant latencies until therapeutic intervention.	0.34741508034065544
Therefore fundamental requirements for thrombolytic therapy are the indentification of potentially suitable patients and the rapid transfer to an appropriate clinic.	0.5409081545294823
A 69-year-old patient with reduced pulmonary function was diagnosed as suffering from non-small cell lung cancer of the left lung invading the main bronchus, pulmonary artery and left atrium.	0.7341905883011333
Using cardiopulmonary bypass, an extended pneumonectomy with partial resection of the left atrium was performed.	0.7227931100386092
The cardiac defect was closed with a pericardial patch.	0.35395538411759253
The lower lobe was divided ex situ from the upper lobe and reimplanted with anastomosis of the lower pulmonary vein to the left auricle.	0.5682925017557385
After a totally uneventful course the patient is in good condition and free of tumor recurrence 2.5 years postoperatively.	0.7798724123098298
In this retrospective study we report the indications, complications and functional and cosmetic results after dermofat grafting into anophthalmic orbits.	0.6577681459853261
The method consists of implantation of autogenous dermis with attached subcutaneous fat from the gluteal region into the orbit.	0.37233764038261563
Twenty-four primary and 4 secondary grafts were implanted in 28 patients aged 12 to 49 years.	0.5042388046927041
In the explantation site one patient showed delayed healing.	0.2960055681362392
All implants became integrated, none were lost because of infection or extrusion.	0.5020984671602177
Eleven patients developed minor complications like central ulceration in the dermis, hair growth on the dermis or suture granuloma.	0.3999755842816595
In the primary implant group the functional and cosmetic outcome was evaluated by measurements of the lid structures, exophthalmometry (Hertel) and measuring the prosthesis motility (Kestenbaum).	0.6188967435126301
Three patients showed fair results; all the others had good or very good results.	0.6232209806788089
In one case of a secondary implant marked graft atrophy was observed.	0.5989634435421315
Despite the more extensive surgery and some minor complications the safety of this method with good functional and cosmetic results makes dermofat grafting an excellent alternative to heterogenous orbital implants.	0.5712985427052
Liver tissue from 14 female patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC; stages I-IV) was systematically investigated for the prevalence and distribution of dendritic antigen-presenting cells.	0.5847390883601723
Dendritic cells (DCs) were immunhistochemically identified by use of anti-S 100 protein and KiMlp antibodies.	0.5537741507487368
We confirm previous findings that, in early PBC, S 100 protein-positive DCs can be detected within the lining of bile duct epithelia.	0.6868483878691952
However, the present study disclosed that S 100 protein- and KiMlp-positive DCs regularly occur in piecemeal necroses (PMNs) developing in PBC-associated chronic hepatitis.	0.6077410408169642
DCs in PMNs were observed in all PBC stages, but were most prominent in late-stage PBC.	0.7058635975662593
These findings suggest that autoimmune tissue damage in PBC may not be limited to bile ducts, but may also ensue in hepatic parenchyma, producing the pattern of chronic hepatitis with signs of activity.	0.5365460249843931
Health care in emergencies is a social good and a hallmark of a humane society, the ethical foundations of which have to form the basis of all decisions regarding medical emergencies.	0.5503962274997188
The ethics of emergency medical care are part of general medical ethics.	0.5506625500594451
Their principles are outlined and put into perspective with regard to dilemmas characteristic of emergency care.	0.3481756199429464
Due to dwindling resources, the efficiency of emergency medical care is being increasingly scrutinized.	0.6563958417006621
Possibilities of rationalizing care without compromising its quality are being discussed, such as renouncing futile therapy and implementing measures of prevention.	0.3901578611008855
If emergency medical services are to accomplish their mission, however, observing standards of medical practice, legal provisions, and the given framework of society, they must not surrender to pure cost containment.	0.587506735295082
We performed a phase II trial with second-line chemotherapy in patients with refractory, metastatic cancer of the bladder.	0.5988431716820223
Second-line therapy consists of 2.6 cycles of mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil and folic acid.	0.708550459700864
Two patients suffered from WHO grade III side effects (nephrotoxicity, leukocytopenia).	0.38209697679261806
We did not find any complete or partial remission.	0.3622764915921778
Four patients had a stable disease; 3.3 months after therapy, patients developed tumor progression with a median survival of 9 months.	0.9347443048938073
Four patients reported an improvement in quality of life.	0.47922857170119376
Since all patients received supportive care, improvement in quality of life cannot be related to chemotherapy alone.	0.6190124040337712
In conclusion, second-line chemotherapy with mitomycin-C, 5-fluorouracil and folic acid has no effect on refractory, metastatic cancer of the bladder and is no alternative for cisplatin and methotrexate-based chemotherapy.	0.5163597393867455
Every form of active euthanasia is a punishable offence under § 216 of the Penal Code; nor is there any ethical justification for it from a medical point of view.	0.3673408181971263
The many strands of the movement in favour of making "death on demand" exempt from punishment in Germany as it is in The Netherlands cannot change this.	0.5237649787045924
The oral retinoid etretinate (Tigason) has recently been replaced by trans-acitretin (Neotigason) in the treatment of severe psoriasis, primarily because of its short half-life and the assumption that a shorter period of subsequent contraception would be required.	0.6780463748353897
After introduction of the new drug, however, circulating quantities of etretinate were detected in patients treated with trans-acitretin.	0.6135369052839631
Thus far, re-esterification has been detected in at least 83 cases.	0.5538168238520024
The 2-month period of strict contraception initially recommended after oral intake of trans-acitretin has been extended to 2 years, as with etretinate.	0.6367727856438896
We review some aspects of trans-acitretin metabolism, with special emphasis on etretinate formation.	0.5928903048094889
Re-esterification of trans-acitretin into etretinate takes place under varying conditions in volunteers and patients, as well as in animal models.	0.5127541941406536
Ethanol is a co-factor for the enzymatic re-esterification of trans-acitretin.	0.41366213979655875
It is unclear whether the introduction of trans-acitretin has been of any significant benefit to patients.	0.5129674558344129
Monitoring of plasma retinoid levels during and after retinoid therapy remains of decisive importance in managing difficult cases and or in approving decisions for pregnancy.	0.390820616908568
The purpose of this study was to compare the midterm results of the conservative treatment of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures in athletes.	0.5923456373037956
During 1989 and 1990, 279 athletes with ACL ruptures were treated in our Sports Surgery Department, and 221 of them were suitable for inclusion in the study.	0.570196778501169
The patients were divided into two groups based on management after the diagnosis of ACL rupture had been  made.	0.5705478570366387
Group I (n = 129) underwent ACL reconstruction using free bone-patellar tendon-bone autografts, while group II (n = 92) received conservative treatment.	0.6345964178755626
We were able to evaluate 92 patients during follow-up (42 from group I and 50 from group II).	0.5924431251907365
The average follow-up period was 86 months.	0.6832288762909758
There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the patients' age, sex, or level of sports activity.	0.8774519760716809
Follow-up consisted of clinical and radiological examinations and recording of the subjective opinions of the patients.	0.810266038012178
During follow-up, we used IKDC and OAK scores to evaluate the results.	0.6784880394972145
We found significantly better results in the group that was operated on if the patients took part in high-risk pivoting sports, but there was no difference if the patients were in the low-risk or no-risk pivoting group of athletes.	0.9606123857841924
Concerning reoperation and early arthrosis, the difference was significant between the two groups.	0.6960151963606158
Background: By depletion of stratospheric ozone, enhanced levels of UV radiation reach the surface of the earth.	0.4871941523715267
Exposure of the anterior parts of the eye to UV radiation leads to irritation of the conjunctival and corneal cells.	0.610200483511181
The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of a low field strength MRI unit (0.2 T; Esaote, Biomedica) and a high field strength MRI unit (1.5 T; Siemens) in detecting meniscal lesions.	0.7983501551676568
Twenty patients were investigated on a 0.2-T low-field MRI unit and a 1.5-T high-field MRI unit for meniscal lesions.	0.8455203680986653
Evaluation was performed of four meniscal compartments (anterior and posterior medial and lateral meniscus), for a total of 80 observations.	0.6769028266595062
The reliability of diagnosis was ranked qualitatively on a three-point scale.	0.5159727022147954
Investigations of the high-field MRI unit revealed a meniscal tear in 6 patients and ruled out a tear in 14 patients.	0.6847900556790397
Evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 58 observations and with moderate confidence in 22 observations.	0.3765392594036418
Investigations of the low-field MRI unit revealed a meniscal tear in 5 patients and ruled out tears in 15 patients.	0.6321594551137013
Evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 39 observations, with moderate confidence in 38 observations, and with low confidence in 3 observations.	0.6361450954637557
The diagnosis in high- and low-field images was identical in 98.7 % of cases; in one patient observations from the high-field unit changed the therapeutic management.	0.9715284462334847
Diagnostic reliability was significantly higher with highfield strength MR imaging.	0.44771697624435575
Low field strength MR imaging shows comparatively high diagnostic accuracy for meniscal lesions compared to high field strength imaging; however, we demonstrated a significantly higher confidence in diagnosis with high-field MR imaging.	0.704907458250558
The past decade has seen the successful application of genetic techniques in the dissection of the most important phenotypes of cancer cells.	0.6586729187295274
In the case of drug resistance mechanisms, the elucidation of the genes involved in resistance to anticancer agents has led to new and unexpected information about tumor physiology and may well open therapeutic options by virtue of reversing clinical chemoresistance.	0.4888264833852514
The experimental characterization of defined multidrug resistance factors, such as P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance associated protein, topoisomerase, or glutathione-S-transferase in urologic malignancies, is now relatively comprehensive, allowing for an initial analysis.	0.5157393229825075
Clinical studies on some of these concepts have been started and will be the subject of careful scrutinity.	0.6356540633233285
We expect that they will have a considerable impact on the way certain urologic anticancer strategies will be pursued in the future.	0.4696458255924107
A study was carried out to determine the risk of dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar and of the lingual nerve after molar surgery.	0.6707697967903189
A total of 1103 impacted lower wisdom teeth and 3 impacted lower second molars were removed in 687 patients, all of whom with unaltered sensibility preoperatively.	0.45831621027986286
Clinical, radiological, and surgical factors of each case were recorded.	0.7080464943746649
Postoperative disturbances in the sensibility of the lip and tongue were evaluated by neurological examination.	0.4885821022415579
Follow-up was carried out for a maximum of 35 weeks.	0.7388466352395885
Dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve occurred with an incidence of 3.57%.	0.5362620414908658
The lingual nerve was injured in 2.1% of patients.	0.6881207531270742
Most of the initially reported alterations in sensation resolved within the follow-up period.	0.5219337613869112
Dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve persisted in 0.91%, and of the lingual nerve in 0.37%.	0.6509613300344486
However, the extent of the prolonged impairment was slight in general.	0.5798714149739419
The effect of the documented factors on the incidence of dysesthesia was analyzed.	0.5503257406241037
For the inferior alveolar nerve, analysis revealed significant effects in older patients, for completely developed roots, for deeply impacted teeth, in the radiological relationship of the roots and the inferior alveolar canal, for difficult surgery, and for intraoperative exposure of the nerve.	0.8196020280116417
The surgeon and the anesthesia had a significant influence on lingual dysesthesia.	0.5231312456313105
Background: This review of radiological and other procedures used in the diagnosis of (chronic) low-back pain is not intended to provide a complete evaluation of the methods employed, because the validity, specificity and sensitivity of the various diagnostic measures are the subject of so much controversy that a comprehensive discussion would be beyond the scope of the present overview.	0.8605230043826202
The choice of method depends not only on the clinical symptoms but also on the localisation of the pain, the aetiology of which may also be related to the age of the patient.	0.8444598745301912
Enteritis and pseudoappendicitis are typical manifestations of Yersinia infections in children.	0.2989103489130432
This is a report on a child with localised tumourous mesenteric lymphadenitis due to Yersinia enterocolitica persistent for a long time.	0.5327827803345854
We found specific antibodies against Yersinia outer membrane proteins repeat-edly in the patients' serum.	0.5751084683975608
Only after a ciprofloxacin therapy for 16 weeks we observed a recovery of our patient.	0.47654689709336967
The present study investigates patients' expectations toward radiotherapy and their associations to quality of life and physician judgements.	0.6474730301017517
Fifty-five patients with tumors of different sites (30 with previous tumor-related surgery, 25 without surgery) admitted to the department of radiotherapy filled out a standardized questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30, PLC by Siegrist et al., therapy-related expectations and success) before and after inpatient radiotherapy.	0.6639934101805322
The corresponding physician ratings were collected.	0.2120960165675338
Fifty-eight percent of the patients expected the therapeutic goal "healing", whereas from the physician's standpoint this was realistic in only 7 % of cases.	0.7251232745758188
The specific radiotherapy-related expectations "tumor control" and "pain relief" reached almost the same levels in patients and physician (71 % vs 71 % and 40 % vs 44 %).	0.829470627635613
Patients with healing expectancy reported higher quality of life at the beginning of the therapy (53.4 % vs 39.9 %); patients expecting pain relief reported lower quality of life (37.1 % vs 54.5 %).	0.735030913509787
Surgical patients who had been operated on within the past year (n = 18) showed a particularly high healing expectancy (83 %), whereas patients whose operation dated back more than 1 year focused on pain relief as therapeutic goal (83 %).	0.6844107729743454
The surgeon, as the primary contact person for patients, can influence patients' therapy-related expectations.	0.8002207408360771
In explaining the overall therapeutic strategy, surgeons should also mention the scope and limits of adjuvant therapies.	0.44028054513188364
The meanings of the terms "quality", "quality of care", and "quality management" were clarified with common international definitions.	0.8563400967144178
Based on that, the basic ideas, concepts, and objectives of quality management in medicine were explained.	0.7109234491120403
Finally some future trends related to quality were viewed, which represent challenges for the medical profession and entire medicine.	0.5839954881350424
The papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome (PPGSS) was first described in 1990 by Harms et al.	0.4202103615438175
The syndrome is characterised by fever, an itchy erythema with edema, confluent papules and purpura of the hands and feet in a "gloves and socks" distribution.	0.5143719250904603
The skin lesions may be associated with purpura and superficial erosions of the oral mucosa.	0.6850152852821081
Viral infections, in particular parvovirus B19, are the most likely trigger.	0.986806686523725
In the present case PPGSS developed after taking trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.	0.6046228880471648
Since the patient developed identical symptoms after accidental re-challenge with the same drug, this case strongly suggests medications as another factor in the pathogenesis of PPGSS.	0.6432453209878014
Most fractures of the clavicle heal well with nonoperative treatment.	0.5198861802880917
On rare occasions, malunited clavicular fractures are associated with a pattern of disability that includes not only pain but also functional or neurovascular impairment.	0.4365601339088784
In these cases, clavicular osteotomy and correction of the deformity should be considered.	0.6159924600823041
In four patients with a malunited fracture of the clavicle following nonoperative treatment, we performed a clavicular osteotomy for deformity.	0.8264366833561488
In all four patients the clavicular fracture healed with shortening associated with pain and ipsilateral glenohumeral dysfunction.	0.48313299790983966
The deformity was not associated with neurovascular dysfunction.	0.3526476242121302
In preoperative X-ray studies, the shortening of the malunited clavicle was between 0.9 and 2.2 cm in comparison to the contralateral clavicle.	0.9074408782131104
All patients underwent an extension osteotomy of the clavicle with interposition of an autogenous iliac crest bone graft.	0.5945140570204369
The follow-up was 1 - 4 years postoperatively.	0.8851373413788347
The functional outcome was evaluated using the Constant-Murley and the UCLA score.	0.5597047579921649
All patients had immediate pain relief following osteotomy and correction of the deformity.	0.6201965496077156
The shoulder function rapidly improved, and the functional outcome was good in three out of the four patients.	0.835463439495535
If there is associated functional impairment in malunited clavicular fractures, extension osteotomy combined with autogenous bone grafting may produce predictably good results.	0.45299972279527895
As the importance of laparoscopic surgery for benign diseases of the gastrointestinal tract continues to grow, the application of this approach in cases of malignancy remains controversial.	0.6090533406946536
Although the concept of cancer recurrence in the area of surgical wounds is not new, the incidence of port site recurrence is the most obvious concern.	0.745943333178692
Indications and contraindications for surgery as well as a standardized nomenclature describing the type of laparoscopic procedures being performed are some other issues that need to be clarified.	0.5655925194803063
Complete laparoscopic procedures or the combination of laparoscopy with open techniques can offer advantages and disadvantages that surgeons will have to take into consideration when making decisions.	0.5212260518329578
The skill of the operating team and the extent of disease define the boundaries of laparoscopic surgery possible.	0.5231960978509398
The continued research as well as development of intelligent instruments and standardized techniques might give laparoscopy a clear role in the treatment of abdominal malignancies.	0.454690280320642
Background: The mechanical stabilization of the cornea in keratoconus may delay progression of this disease.	0.6673956818560822
The cross-linking techniques optimized in corneas of enucleated porcine eyes were investigated under in vivo conditions in rabbits to estimate the biocompatibility and duration of the stiffening effect.	0.48029730786183333
In the biopsy material of a polypoid intrabronchial lesion of a 54-year-old male patient with radiologically established lung tumor, spindle-cell neoplasia was seen.	0.4946855924552843
No clear histogenetic classification of the submucous tumor process was possible.	0.459233000316231
After resection of the right upper lobe of the lung, including the results of additional immunohistochemical analyses, the tumor was classified as biphasic synovial sarcoma.	0.8549716592632282
This was suggested mostly by immunohistochemical detection of the epithelial membrane antigene (EMA) and of vimentin.	0.6682353542707394
Extensive clinical examinations ruled out the possibility of a primary tumor with extrapulmonary localization.	0.6167598438600904
This case report shows the problems faced in correctly classifying the histogenesis or the direction of differentiation in extremely rare cases of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma.	0.5772162060106939
Especially in small biopsy samples showing a submucous spindle-cell tumor of the lung, apart from frequent sarcoma metastases, the presence of primary synovial sarcoma of the lung has to be considered in the differential diagnosis.	0.663100057013919
Necrotizing pancreatitis is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.	0.4812438698927774
Formerly, surgical treatment with early and extensive pancreatic resection has been the standard.	0.8068737968669265
Improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and progress in the field of intensive care therapy have made conservative therapy the initial standard in the treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis.	0.7585063798384077
A considerable percentage of patients with sterile necrosis can be managed with low morbidity and mortality by conservative treatment without operation.	0.7711272448258513

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of IP on skeletal muscle function after 3 h ischemia and 2 h reperfusion in a rodent model.	0.5493128382736919
IP protocols using one, two, or three preconditioning cycles of 10 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion each, were compared to non-preconditioned controls.	0.6813046388002422
IP was found to significantly improve force, performance, endurance, and contractility of postischemic skeletal muscle.	0.6122848428537361
The efficacy of IP- induced protection was correlated with the number of preconditioning cycles.	0.47371566825542905
Preconditioning with three cycles resulted in a more effective protection as compared to one or two cycles.	0.7036314439031436

With regard to molecular prognostic risk factors most of the reported data on proliferation markers, tumor suppressor genes, proteases and adhesion molecules have to be confirmed in prospective randomized trials prior to their widespread clinical use.	0.6268893934437556
Based on the available data on prospective studies percentage of embryonal carcinoma and vascular invasion appear to be the most significant prognosticators.	0.760231136568091
Investigation and identification of those factors determining the aggressive biologic behavior of embryonal carcinoma compared to all other histological components appear to be most promising in research for prognosticators of metastatic disease.	0.48042129541357453
After laparoscopic cholecystectomy, carbon dioxide (CO2) must be exhaled after resorption from the abdominal cavity.	0.41459803811671275
There is controversy about the amount and relevance of postoperative CO2 resorption.	0.4627352941885458
Without continuous postoperative monitoring, after laparoscopic cholecystectomy a certain risk may consist in unnoticed hypercapnia due to CO2 resorption.	0.4526763272949413
Studies exist on the course of end-expiratory CO2 (PeCO2) alone over a longer postoperative period of time in extubated patients during spontaneous breathing.	0.5708661404236478
The goal of this prospective study was to investigate the amount of CO2 resorbed from the abdominal cavity in the postoperative period by means of CO2 metabolism.	0.701174295101753
After giving informed consent to the study, which was approved by the local ethics committee, 20 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	0.8327344168682188
All patients received general endotracheal anaesthesia.	0.44339291913297574
After induction, total IV anaesthesia was maintained using fentanyl, propofol, and atracurium.	0.623208962109224
Patients were ventilated with oxygen in air (FiO2 0.4).	0.5289634484060535
The intraabdominal pressure during the surgical procedure ranged from 12 to 14 mm Hg.	0.4895943247282025
Thirty minutes after releasing the capnoperitoneum (KP), CO2 elimination (V.CO2), oxygen uptake (V.O2), and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured every minute for 1 h by indirect calorimetry using the metabolic monitor Deltatrac according to the principle of Canopy.	0.6244999913311262
Assuming an unchanged metabolism, the CO2 resorption (V.CO2) at any given time (t) can be calculated from V.CO2 (t)=V.CO2 (t)-RQ (preop) V.O2 (t).	0.7792006997634006
It was thus necessary to define the patient's metabolism on the day of operation.	0.6930555099586102
The first data were collected before surgery and after introduction of the arterial and venous cannulae for a 15-min period.	0.694541004663877
Measuring point 0 was determined after exsufflation of the KP and emptying of the remaining CO2 via manual compression by the surgeon at the end of surgery.	0.5230471757936089
Patient's tracheas were extubated and metabolic monitoring started 30 min after release of the KP for 60 min.	0.4733188659190974
Simultaneously, a nasal side-stream capnometry probe was placed and the PeCO2 and respiratory frequency (RF) were obtained by the Capnomac Ultima (Datex) and registered every minute as well.	0.6079186888452558
Values were averaged over four periods of 15 min each.	0.35322879226863085
An arterial blood gas sample was drawn at the end of every 15-min period.	0.5157961020793891
Postoperative pain was scored by a visual analog scale and completed by a subjective index questionnaire on general well-being.	0.47469044047185455
All data were analysed by the Friedman or Wilcoxon test; P<0.05 was considered significant.	0.47593478733531974
The findings do not indicate CO2 resorption in the postoperative period after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Tables 2 and 3, Fig.	0.6686850072470351
Arterial CO2 as well as PeCO2 were elevated postoperatively (45 mm Hg vs. 36 mm Hg intraoperatively), while V.CO2 and V.O2 were unchanged when compared to the preoperative measuring period.	0.654345363658675
The postoperative RF was comparable to preoperative values.	0.41272632412133475
Calculated CO2 was lower than 10 ml/min and within accuracy of measurements.	0.7227023549674296
The postoperative pain index ranged between 3 and 4, and 3.75 - 15 mg piritramid was administered.	0.835088474088484
All patients feld tired immediately after the operation, but scores improved slightly at the end of the 60-min period of metabolic monitoring.	0.583517238561175
There is no significant resorption of CO2 from the abdominal cavity later than 30 min after releasing the KP.	0.6165499524934102
Up to this time, any CO2 remaining in the abdominal cavity after careful emptying by the surgeon has been resorbed and exhaled.	0.5648194461214079
The gene of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)-inhibitor p16INK4A (CDKN2/MTS1) has been proposed as a candidate for a tumor-suppressor gene located on chromosome 9p21, a frequently deleted region in a series of human cancers including malignant melanoma.	0.5691983805323367
An increasing and sometimes conflicting body of data has accumulated regarding the frequency of homozygous deletions and mutations as well as the importance of p16INK4A in malignant melanoma.	0.4717158415559701
The purpose of this review is therefore to summarize the current knowledge on p16INK4A and to discuss its biologic significance in the pathogenesis of melanocytic tumors.	0.6967911446891163
The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in HIV-infected patients is high.	0.6151607048893993
The differential diagnosis includes psychoreactive disorders, acute psychiatric symptoms of an HIV-associated encephalopathy, and symptomatic psychotic illnesses due to secondary neurologic manifestations such as opportunistic central nervous infections and intracerebral lymphoma.	0.5959055553362989
Clinical aspects and psychopathological findings are not sufficient for differential diagnosis and identification of primarily psychiatric disorders.	0.6142177347972475
Secondary neurologic manifestations causing a symptomatic psychosis must be excluded as soon as possible by brain imaging (CT, MRI) and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid.	0.7292395077264633
In emergency situations, however, German law imposes strict regulations, especially in the case of sectioned patients.	0.5546557997175396
These medical and medicolegal questions are illustrated by case reports and propositions for an effective strategy are made.	0.4575758467172227
In simultaneous bilateral nerve recordings, patients with Sympathetically Maintained Pain (SMP) affecting one limb show similar sympathetic traffic in nerves supplying the affected and unaffected limb, also when the painful limb shows a marked regional autonomic (vasomotor) dysfunction.	0.45898374419485677
These findings argue against the notion that SMP must be mediated by a reflex change in the pattern of sympathetic discharge.	0.4511651556420647
In general, they underline the fact that autonomic effector disturbances may give little information about underlying nerve traffic.	0.4705513830015226
Intraoperative transluminal angioplasty (ITA) has considerably broadened the spectrum of vascular surgical reconstruction, fulfils the requirements of minimally invasive therapy and has thus experienced a rapid development within the past few years.	0.5823467532227092
Whereas the indications and clinical results have been described adequately in the literature, reports on the procedural management of ITA are rare.	0.7411781322071914
One of the basic prerequisites of this method is the correct and nontraumatic implantation of the vascular access sheath at the proper location.	0.7926429980736386
In the following, the technique of ortho- and retrograde sheath implantation, either through the vessel itself or through a vascular graft, is described in detail.	0.8021316384984413
By respecting particular standards for sheath introduction, ischaemia time and vessel wall injury during ITA can be kept to a minimum.	0.34816148001099845
The importance of the chronology of vascular reconstruction to angioplasty is also elucidated.	0.5055596617162926
In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of sheath implantation compared with direct vessel puncture are demonstrated.	0.5271100236906939
In spite of new developments, including intraluminal fixation of the sheath with an expandable balloon, the "ideal" angioplasty access sheath is, as yet, not available.	0.7071388136520946
In several cases of lupus erythematosus (SLE, SCLE, DLE), the Koebner phenomenon could be seen in the apparently normal skin of patients following traumas, scratching effects, operation scars, contact dermatitis, pressure from sock tops, application of liquid nitrogen, exposure to strong sun light, etc.	0.5215788652231409
The interval between exposure to such provocation factors and appearance of the isomorphic reactions varied from case to case.	0.4573862313426016
In SLE patients receiving systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids, the Koebner phenomenon could not be found, while it was detected in patients with generalized DLE who had never received any systemic glucocorticoid hormones.	0.7003873774187095
It was not seen in patients with localized DLE.	0.631978049522946
There was no direct relationship between the appearance of humoral autoantibodies and onset of the Koebner phenomenon.	0.6251208680029754
With regard to the histopathogenesis of the Koebner phenomenon, it is thought that disturbances of the local cellular repair processes and of the cytokine network, with expression of adhesion molecules, might be involved.	0.6707868324742093
The Koebner phenomenon may be a valuable model for the investigation of lupus erythematosus.	0.6578755924517224

We represent and discuss etiology, diagnosis as well as differential diagnoses of tuberculous orchtitis referring to an actual case of this rare disease.	0.5729734562856876
In the least of all cases one can conclude from the clinical symptoms on the tuberculous origin of the disease.	0.6914555744852608
Other differential diagnoses will set more frequently due to rarity of this disease.	0.39004379316628046
Quite a lot of cases a bacterial superinfection veils the sterile leucocyturia as main characteristic of genitourinary tuberculosis.	0.36897225834965963

As before the evidence of Mycobacteria tuberculosis is the most important parameter to proof a tuberculosis.	0.620959941165127
Despite required microbiological cultivation to make a resistogram the polymerase chain reaction is a high sensitive and comparable fast method for detection of Mycobacteria even from tissue.	0.5187255462711765
In such dubious cases we recommend to perform an operative denudation due to frequently difficult delimitation from malignant testicular tumours.	0.4030954046990259
In surgical procedures associated with high blood loss, such as vascular and cardiac operations, differential diagnosis and therapy of perioperative hemorrhage are of special importance.	0.6616227394690422
Preoperative screening for patients at high risk of bleeding and in particular for those with qualitative platelet disorders [drug-induced platelet disorders (in particular ASS), von Willebrand's disease and other congenital platelet disorders] is effective in minimizing blood loss.	0.7317471454416038
Bleeding in acute medical emergencies or during emergency operations may require treatment without specific investigations being performed in advance.	0.3738908202881269
Therefore, simple schemes are essential for the rapid management of acute hemostatic problems.	0.6573569267816786
The aim of this paper was to address the diagnostic and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis focusing mainly on diagnosis and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis due to blood platelet disorders and blood coagulation disorders and preoperative identification of patients at increased risk of bleeding.	0.7095207670625894
Although deep vein thrombosis now has a better prognosis than in the era before anticoagulation, a number of patients remain in whom ulcus cruris cannot be adequately controlled by conservative treatment.	0.6130678872600466
The case report of a 50-year-old woman with stage III chronic venous insufficiency associated with the post-thrombotic syndrome is presented.	0.6857590078887142
Progress in imaging techniques and functional diagnostics of the post-thrombotic syndrome make a reliable differentiation of the chronic venous insufficiency possible with respect to obstruction or reflux.	0.5876602255496609
If conservative treatment fails, autological valve transplantation is described as a suitable reconstructive management method in the treatment of reflux.	0.4841903946463037
Following this report, the results and limitations of this method are discussed.	0.9616180621195343
The neurobiological alterations commonly found in affective disorders (e.g., alterations in the nocturnal sleep profile, dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system) gradually recover with improvement of the depressive syndrome.	0.4503281552928893
Their persistence during full clinical remission, however, is associated with an increased risk for relapse and, thus may represent trait markers for affective disorders.	0.616144983967593
In order to test this hypothesis, we designed a prospective study in which healthy first-degree relatives (high-risk probands; HRPs; n=54) of patients with an affective disorder are investigated by means of polysomnography, the combined dexamethasone and corticotropine-releasing hormone (DEX-CRH) test and a variety of psychometric scales.	0.6858429988349595
In the present part of the study (index assessment), these HRPs, as a group, showed depressionlike alterations in both the sleep pattern and the DEX-CRH-test outcome; furthermore, their psychometric profile was characterized by elevated scores on the scales assessing "rigidity" and "autonomic lability".	0.7389841151403992
On a single-case level, 35% of the HRPs were identified as conspicuous (depressionlike) in at least two of the three areas investigated.	0.7953481901962649
A decision of whether or not this "conspicuousness" indeed represents a trait marker for affective disorders can be reached when the follow-up part of the study has identified those HRPs with their respective premorbide status who have developed an affective disorder in the meantime.	0.6107812590913324
Undifferentiated connective tissue disease with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome was diagnosed in a 33 year old woman after recurrent arterial thromboses, two miscarriages and myocarditis.	0.5802075227220532
