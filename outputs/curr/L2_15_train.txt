Mr President, Mrs Karamanou' s question is an extremely serious one, and I would not wish to conceal that fact.	1.0591936388549206
We are perfectly aware of the difficult and dramatic humanitarian situation in Kosovo and of the problem of displaced people in that region - and I mean people who originate from Kosovo - and of the particular effect of this on child health and on mortality rates.	0.9320669250443138
I think it is well known that the European Union has made a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid effort being made by the international community.	0.9636844096609488
As you know, the European Community has contributed a total of EUR 378 million for the province of Kosovo alone, and this has to be seen in conjunction with the contributions made by Member States at national level.	1.0331735763486116
This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification.	0.48439802296344264
Furthermore, as you know, the European Union makes a contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which came to EUR 66.3 million in 1999.	0.8951947674999344
I think that Mrs Karamanou is aware that, because of the need for division of labour between the international donors, the task of restoring health care in Kosovo has been entrusted to the World Health Organisation.	0.8547979891051481
The reports produced by the WHO indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation, and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and general hospitals.	0.686158822208523
Nevertheless, we are aware that this situation is far from a satisfactory solution and that there are widespread repercussions in other areas of health care, apart from child health.	0.8498728586413941
This is not just a technical situation, it is a political situation, and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation, because there are aspects to this, and we may as well be open about this, which are associated with the international community' s inability up to now to make a multi-ethnic society function in Kosovo, with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region.	1.0560846487890547
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for your answer which supplements what Commissioner Patten said yesterday on the subject.	0.7225628027870611
Yet, the sum of EUR 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999, was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even rudimentary civilised conditions in Kosovo, especially where the provision of health services is concerned.	0.7228767206505304
Mr President-in-Office, do you not think that the very fact of increased child mortality is an abomination for the continent of Europe, a shameful thing, which should motivate us all, so that the aid we provide becomes more effective and more generous?	0.810521496580559
Of course, the situation was not idyllic, even before the bombardments, anything but, I should say. However, since NATO' s intervention, there has been a very clear deterioration in the natural and human environment.	1.0252288161385257
So, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised conditions for the long-suffering inhabitants of Kosovo, and above all, keep our promises to them?	0.8326363579569255
Mrs Karamanou, I recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in Kosovo in this field have not been enough.	1.2627046592415552
I do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that.	0.7578778208500102
I do not want to link this question with your comments about the period "before" and "after" NATO' s intervention, as we will probably touch on that issue at another point during this Question Time.	0.7252935955093032
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the European Union is aware that the resources it has devoted to Kosovo reflect the financial limitations it has to work within.	0.9228291402073786
We have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community.	0.8520830034076565
The European Union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role, but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were, as you have said yourself, Mrs Karamanou, not the best before the military action in Kosovo.	1.0661826471380786
What is more, I do not believe, Mrs Karamanou, that the military action in Kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation.	0.9771631980191584
The present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations, and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in Kosovo' s administration.	0.6386628496287056
This is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole.	0.8816991616226475
And if we cannot solve the political problem, which must be done in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolution, then we will not solve the problem of child health, nor the various other problems faced by this region.	0.952948520753473
I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica.	0.8456580846284975
In cooperation with Europe, the international community rebuilt the hospital there too, but it is located in the northern part of the city, thus prohibiting access to Albanian Kosovars.	0.8435153782993223
This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars.	0.4796966891764934
This is also happening elsewhere in the country, causing tension between the Albanian Kosovars and Serbs, making for a situation where nobody trusts anybody anymore and where Albanians do not want to be looked after by Serbs and vice versa.	0.7146560748623546
I understand very well what you are saying and you are right: the European Union should work in a wider context of international cooperation.	0.8969239260684237
But where will you place the emphasis?	0.3056916226192133
What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital, including that in Mitrovica?	0.6829569367744378
Mr Staes, the situation in Mitrovica is well known.	0.973398472293819
This is a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of Kosovo.	0.5946407112591332
I perfectly understand Mr Staes' s concerns.	0.22202286555442696
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Bernard Kouchner' s work in this area has aimed to comply with the objectives of the relevant United Nations resolution, in an attempt to create multi-ethnic facilities which can serve the various communities, including the various aspects of the administration.	0.9244162789171182
I believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible, because there are various protagonists involved.	0.8956014491088505
The situation in Mitrovica is appalling, and involves very special tensions, and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed.	0.9820649755436867
Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals.	0.9772847645459244
Question No 3 by (H-0027/00):	0.22727784129443077
Subject: Indictment of NATO before War Crimes Tribunal Human rights organisations, such as the US Human Rights Watch, have already collected significant evidence of NATO crimes in connection with the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia with a view to bringing a case before the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.	0.5929409273249899
On the basis of this evidence, some of which has already been lodged with the Tribunal, NATO is accused of 'serious violations of international humanitarian law' and 'wilful murder'.	0.6870404584481037
Does the Council consider that such accusations should be put before the War Crimes Tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation?	0.5780694841889954
In the event of a judicial inquiry into the accusations against NATO, what will be done in respect of the High Representative for the CFSP, who was NATO Secretary-General during the crisis?	0.9237460710824542
Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed?	0.5228913980454692
Mr President, Mr Alavanos' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues.	0.6548314905139131
The Council has already, on various occasions, stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by NATO were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions.	0.6683070015569258
I am aware that there may be different views about NATO' s action and the legitimacy of that action.	0.7716322753427375
Everyone is free to hold such views.	0.2995318717510823
In my own country, the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter.	0.6721644276283735
That was how it was.	0.26704426558638744
In any case, the Council' s position is clear in that it considers that the objective of the air campaign carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo caused by the Belgrade regime.	0.8102775857260334
This objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April.	0.6131767729433766
I must say that these NATO measures were not taken lightly and were only carried out as a last resort when it became evident that all avenues for reaching a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the Belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces in order to expel the Kosovo Albanians from their land.	0.5214042909677802
I am sure you are aware, Mr Alavanos, that, during her recent visit to NATO headquarters, Prosecutor Del Ponte stressed that the International Tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it, including those made against NATO, in particular by pacifist groups from Canada.	0.8361232054656514
This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted.	0.5980431228557218
In any case, I have with me a statement made by Prosecutor Del Ponte according to which NATO is not at present under any investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning NATO' s actions in the Kosovo conflict.	0.8133516216116226
All information received during the past six months, either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of NATO' s actions during the Kosovo conflict, have been recorded by the Prosecutor.	0.6822802151698081
Any other information will of course be analysed by the Prosecutor, who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action.	0.7517053220968198
Until that time Prosecutor Del Ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of criminality made against NATO.	0.4589671840282801
I thank the President-in-Office but I do not agree with him that the purpose of NATO' s intervention was to stop a humanitarian disaster, because we have a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo today, we have the hell of Milosevic, followed by the hell of the KLA and the NATO forces.	0.8584705932895337
If the President-in-Office has noticed, almost half the questions he has had to answer today relate to Kosovo.	0.5973886824169139
Despite this, he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the War Crimes Tribunal against NATO after applications by Canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question.	0.5571803139607178
My question, which the President-in-Office did not answer, is this: if this inquisition procedure begins, in which the main or, if you will, one of the main people interrogated and probably found guilty will be Mr Solana, who is today the High Representative of the European Union' s Common Foreign and Security Policy, should it not be, if that happens, if the General Prosecutor of the Tribunal is determined to begin the process, that Mr Solana' s status is suspended at least until it is shown that his hands are clean?	0.9241758854799712
Mr Alavanos, if an action of this kind should be brought against NATO and if this action were to be brought against Mr Javier Solana personally, we would have to bear in mind that Mr Javier Solana held one post at that time and is holding a different one today.	0.9228820575995063
The duties that he exercises today have nothing whatsoever to do with the duties that he exercised during his time as Secretary-General of NATO.	0.5319816339293705
In the absence of any corresponding indication from any international judicial body which could justify any personal accusation against Mr Javier Solana - and there is no sign of this whatsoever - the European Union will not of course make any statement at all on this matter.	0.7199738504773343
Mr President, I believe Mr Alavanos is getting NATO and Mr Milosevic mixed up.	0.75534309930106
Mr Milosevic should be appearing before the war crimes tribunal and we should be awarding NATO the Sakharov prize.	0.5489792249104581
But I have a quite different question for the Council.	1.0500698700379338
How do matters stand in Kosovo with regard to the rebuilding of the administration, the judiciary and, most importantly of all, the police force?	0.8760126527904581
You mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done.	0.6422534646360987
Rapid action is called for!	0.2532918511672038
First of all, I would like to say that I agree with the priorities you have identified concerning personal responsibility, Mr Posselt.	0.8287528583384307
With regard to the judicial structure in Kosovo, we have already heard Mr Kouchner, on various occasions, describe the enormous difficulties he is experiencing in setting up administrative machinery and a judicial structure.	0.8170507466519998
As you know, the first steps were taken some months ago.	0.8135207361718624
We are all aware of the difficulties, and particularly the financial difficulties, that Mr Kouchner is facing in setting up this administrative machinery, and, in particular, we are aware of the special difficulty involved in recruiting police so as to ensure day-to-day public safety.	0.9469397370191291
This is a responsibility that the European Union takes very seriously, Mr Posselt, and I would like to mention that, at the General Affairs Council held on Monday, this issue was repeatedly stressed when we were discussing Kosovo.	1.0224742259107922
Statements were made and pressure was brought to bear on the various Member States who have undertaken to make police resources available to honour their commitments.	0.5925189254892095
Some Member States are taking refuge in the fact that they have provided military forces and that they cannot send the police forces, to which they committed themselves, as quickly as they would like.	1.0236365679568549
We are certainly very much aware that this factor is seriously compromising Mr Kouchner' s work and the normalisation of administrative structures in Kosovo, especially as regards judicial structures and police cover.	0.7157038855009068
This is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter-ethnic coordination, and we are all conscious that, if measures are not taken in the short term, we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago, and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of Kosovo.	0.9845312625012693
This is obviously a question which really has to be seen in a NATO context, but, as the European Union shares NATO' s view of these issues, it is not difficult for us to associate ourselves with this. I would like to make this clear on behalf of the Council, so that there can be no doubt.	1.0675524419766829
Mr Marset Campos, you will be aware, first of all, of how difficult it is to select targets during a military operation, particularly an air-based one, and you will also be aware that there is a category of targets that, whilst they are not military targets as such, are infrastructure targets selected with a view to hindering the smooth running of the military machine.	0.8862956989956965
We are of course entering a grey area here, and you may say, Mr Marset Campos, that these are civilian targets, such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure, whilst others will tell me that they are military targets, because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by Mr Milosevic' s forces in Kosovo.	0.8597026111481774
So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets.	0.5802827232939389
Unfortunately, and as everyone recognised during the military action in Kosovo, there were civilian sectors, and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public, and even inhabited areas, which were directly affected by NATO air attacks.	1.0554918590895552
This is generally recognised and this happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war was not a clean war, nor a model war, but a war based on the art of the possible.	0.8991844379872518
And, above all, it was a necessary war, and it was not only about what was possible, it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community.	0.9798610753389042
Mr Marset Campos, regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight, if you take no action yourself - I believe that, if we look at what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to, and the continuation of that impunity, then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light.	0.9067297146843081
Question No 4 by (H-0028/00):	0.23632493265594354
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Council taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	0.6469924623828899
Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	0.3918320435161448
Mr President, I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer.	0.9650357258516195
Nevertheless, I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when, ultimately, there is in fact a major tripartite relationship.	0.9382410633450603
We provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place, in order to help Armenia, and still the aid cannot come into play because Turkey has imposed an economic blockade, and so many things cannot get through to the Armenians at all.	0.8075299416381212
We are negotiating with Turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the Union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a Member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours.	0.8930073328057868
Can you not exert greater influence over Turkey, so as to enable there to be peaceful developments in this region, and so as to enable Armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front?	0.9301417516513732
- (PT) Mrs Schleicher, you are quite right to say that we should use our relationship with Turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and, particularly, that it becomes part of the solution rather than part of the problem.	1.0405898796332265
We feel that precisely because Turkey has embarked on a new type of relationship with the European Union, and also because Turkey now has to respond to the European Union' s positions on common foreign and security policy issues, we will, to be frank, be testing Turkey' s will as regards the European Union' s priorities in its foreign relations.	0.9505303947172883
Our relationship with Armenia, as evinced by the agreement we signed with that country last year, is of course one element in these foreign relations.	0.7958835272331922
We also feel that, if Turkey wishes to move towards sharing the fundamental values of the European Union and the general framework of the European Union' s relations, regardless of whatever special bilateral conditions may apply to its own relations with any other country, it must in general act in accordance with the basic standards demonstrated by the European Union in its foreign relations.	0.9028001981276089
We are, moreover, convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future.	0.7675890319911395
Question No 6 by (H-0122/00):	0.20229631828027908
Subject: Ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo Since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU aimed at preventing the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians by Serbia, and since the arrival of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200 000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 murdered, constituting ethnic cleansing on a larger scale than that carried out by the Serbs themselves.	0.6087991731485964
During the last few days we have seen Serbs murdered by Kosovar Albanian Mafia-type groups, also with impunity.	0.7810652489273301
What decision will the Council adopt to put an end, once and for all, to this ethnic cleansing and to guarantee respect for the human rights of the whole population of Kosovo, irrespective of race or creed?	0.8984107530366578
I thank the Minister for his response, but I would also like to point out that, statistically, there is now more violence in Kosovo than there was before the NATO bombing.	0.8637320255339036
It is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation, and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of NATO and the European Union to take such action.	0.9310835882706949
I agree with what the Minister very rightly said about the culpability of Belgrade, but we should also remember that the secret services of the USA, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have been supplying arms and money to the KLA, a mafia, which has contributed to the problems in the area.	0.9752961903425438
We are therefore all to blame.	0.7032635766512344
I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context.	0.7786141335302617
Do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia?	0.7059359780232229
Mr President, I am no friend of Milosevic or his government.	0.7243784384824263
Nevertheless I have the gravest doubts about the legitimacy of Nato's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, both in terms of the lack of authority from the UN Security Council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on Serbia's sovereignty at Rambouillet.	0.6740401222061874
The current situation in Kosovo, which is now ethnically cleansed of Serbs and Roma, speaks for itself.	0.8216614802856974
Should Nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the Belgrade TV tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists, which remains a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our Western leaders?	0.5762725609476156
Mr Tannock, with regard to the position adopted by the European Union, we do not have selective interpretations and analyses of what were military objectives, and in particular of the initiatives taken against certain types of infrastructure that were propping up Mr Milosevic' s political system and acting as propaganda for him.	0.7572482816743699
I cannot therefore tell you whether we agreed or not on a specific action carried out by NATO, but it was part of an overall plan with which we do agree.	0.8774353457492134
Some of these actions might have been questionable, and some were regarded as unfortunate by NATO itself, but others were justified for tactical reasons, with the aim of preventing Mr Milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former Yugoslavia.	0.7772128717113306
In any event, I, on behalf of the Council, do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carried out by NATO.	0.8117509647010918
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, since I know the history of the Balkans, I should like to remind you that, for many decades, the peoples of Yugoslavia lived in peace.	0.8529659915478798
Destabilisation began around ten years ago with the break-up of Yugoslavia, in which the European Union played a decisive part.	0.832614111557592
Yugoslavia' s crime was that it was the only Balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union.	0.8289169973442627
So whatever remained standing after the air attacks is now being destroyed by the supposedly disarmed KLA, under the very nose of KFOR, whose role as an occupying force is becoming increasingly apparent.	0.5737779991491498
Every day, new crimes come to light against non-Albanian speakers and against the cultural heritage of Kosovo, and there are hundreds of violations of the UN' s Resolution 1244.	0.8276338808587888
In my opinion, the best thing the Council could do would be to cease occupying that part of Yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides, with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another, independent country.	0.8979837977187558
I respect your understanding and knowledge of the Balkan region, Mr Alyssandrakis, but I find it difficult, quite frankly, to understand how respecting the characteristics of the region can, in terms of political stability, be a solution to the problem.	1.0512842618867042
If we look at the democratic stability of the region, it could perhaps be said that it was the break-up of Yugoslavia that caused the current situation, but let us not get involved in interpreting an international development.	0.9778718674085969
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Yugoslavia was what it was, in the sense that the state managed to harmonise some of its people' s ethnic differences to a degree. It must be pointed out that it did this at a time when its political framework was far from ideal in terms of being democratically representative.	0.7994427313805698
The division of Yugoslavia is probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept, regardless of the mistakes that may have been made along the way.	0.882168800898798
We do not feel that withdrawing international forces now would be any kind of solution. Quite the contrary, it would be a solution leading to calamity.	0.7278321870363385
Mr President, I was a little disappointed with the answer given by the President-in-Office to my colleague.	1.0249716657925902
It is very important, if we stress that Europe is to be a Europe of values, that we do not go down the road of saying that means justify ends.	1.1487554129110777
If civilian targets were targeted and destroyed, killing civilians is illegal by anyone's standards.	0.30155691725298056
It should not be defended even by those of us who deeply deplore the Milosevic regime.	0.5824954889321987
That, however, is not my question.	0.8884611510129173
My question is about political prisoners held in Serbia now.	0.5938118587670675
There are, I believe, around 5 000 Kosovar political prisoners held in Serbia at the moment.	0.6399962494585572
My question to the President-in-Office is twofold.	0.6051475072817224
Firstly, is the Council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners?	0.9661534227628203
Secondly, what does it propose to do about them?	0.8996762500020751
Mr MacCormick, first of all, I would like to answer your comments.	0.5523754543033363
I did not defend attacks on civilians.	0.37705551095926926
What I said and what I explained in a previous answer is that there are civilian targets linked with structures which are objects for military action, and you know as well as I do that some military actions not only go for military targets, but also for civilian targets and structures which are connected with military action.	0.8296114066282579
What is a legitimate target is obviously a grey area.	0.6099693248841432
As I said, we are not making value judgements about specific actions.	0.8459638110140443
We are making an overall value judgement about NATO' s action, and this overall value judgement is positive. We agree with the general view of NATO' s action.	0.9596408579070882
With regard to political prisoners in Serbia, Mr MacCormick, it is obvious that, when I say that in Serbia today Mr Milosevic is not acting in accordance with the rules of a decent society at international level, I am referring specifically, not just to the way he acts towards his fellow citizens. I am also referring to the way Mr Milosevic treats political prisoners, and the way he attacks democratic rights and the opposition' s rights of access to the media, and to his attacks on the facilities that should be granted to non-governmental organisations, particularly those protecting human rights.	0.9927895139507981
In spite of everything, all this represents only one of many kinds of highly pernicious action perpetrated by Mr Milosevic on Yugoslavian society, and the European Union is of course inevitably concerned about this situation.	0.8708058507972559
This is precisely why the European Union is maintaining all its sanctions until Yugoslavia' s behaviour on the international stage reflects the values that we have to defend.	0.8158050171205181
Question No 7 by (H-0035/00):	0.20709981710446915
Subject: Drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	0.7843810773908798
What are the Council's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	0.5595847878987901
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)?	0.6702706015595304
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	0.578362028317698
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	0.4518176650195623
What are the Council's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	0.5303405176528679
I thank the President-in-Office for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work.	0.6625848485641836
You will understand, Mr President-in-Office, that there was a point to my question, because the Council is a political body of the European Union and the citizens of Europe, men and women, want to know how it views the democratic and social model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	0.943006931186058
As a supplementary question, I should like to ask you whether, as the Portuguese Presidency, you have made provision for the rights of children, as such, to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the Charter.	1.1032385378277594
As I said, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.8760994601659672
This procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group, and the matter will only be submitted to the Council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter.	0.9776706951662675
I would nevertheless like to say, with regard to the rights of the child, that we consider this to be an extremely topical issue, particularly for the Council of Europe and in view of the existence of a set of relevant international texts to which we have signed up.	1.0356454005127307
This matter should form part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.4507402803366006
This will certainly be the guideline that my government for one will advocate for the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.5219066325700054
Furthermore, we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposals that we have on this issue.	1.1348093569140598
I do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not.	0.7110389634805029
I presume, however, that this is not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bringing together the currently agreed corpus of rights, which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be included in the charter and be shared by the Union as a whole.	0.8781126778343202
I would remind Members that, according to the guidelines for these sittings, questions must be concise and be worded in a way which will allow a brief answer.	0.8081452831713853
You know that there is a Parliamentary delegation chaired by Mr Méndez de Vigo and a Committee on Constitutional Affairs where these issues can be debated at great length.	0.6110248238027844
I therefore ask that both questions and answers be very brief.	0.6541182236515835
Otherwise, we would be in a way undermining the whole process of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.0538299496385217
I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything, but I must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers.	0.9280943316666266
Mr Rübig has the floor.	0.5030374758664496
Mr President, fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions on another Member State, because a democratically elected government was formed there.	0.7026685694724344
Both parties were once part of the government.	0.5509213307506022
So far there have been no infringements of the law.	0.5359026901724655
Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights?	0.5084017120399236
Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council, in respect of the formation of national governments, be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	0.6773388085289456
Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	0.3652867472105326
Mr Rübig, as President-in-Office, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union was adopted bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union.	0.8769139946054904
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States was actually a set of actions of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level. We feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which, although it has become part of a European Union government, does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the Union' s aims.	0.8617167208615173
I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency, because my government intervened at the request of, and in conjunction with, fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity.	0.9466564483585928
Mr President, I have the honour of being a member of the Convention drafting the Charter so I am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the Convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force.	0.8551048072031544
What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up?	0.8089780630547778
Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document?	0.9762626804231214
Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter?	0.5714520780904235
- (PT) The answer is neither yes nor no.	0.6521252419792163
I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council.	1.1616006630175337
Question No 8 by (H-0042/00):	0.1528935547282324
Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits.	0.5735134176914426
These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects.	0.5535314541526121
Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process?	0.33695620398561843
The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.	0.572836070026657
The World Bank has decided not to fund the project, which will displace 20 000 Kurds, potentially limit the fresh water supply to Syria and Iraq and cause ecological damage.	0.6567359768560552
What is the Council's view of the involvement of European governments and companies in this project?	0.8637926550148608
The process of agreeing these common standards may have started as long ago as 1978 but clearly the fact that the British Government appears to be going ahead with a massively environmentally damaging project suggests that it has not been very successful so far.	0.6374715235486577
I wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by EU companies in the EU applicant countries.	0.689351975991454
I ask this because of the issue of coherence, the subject of this morning' s discussion.	0.8016694862246133
On the one hand we ask applicant countries to take on board the environmental acquis and yet, at the very same time, the EU Member States are supporting and encouraging investment in those countries which is itself hugely environmentally damaging.	0.8972739524777681
Can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant countries has featured in any of the discussions to date to which you have been referring?	0.7806026090777857
- (PT) Mrs Lucas, I was not present at the debate you are referring to.	0.8828048576366463
I would like to say that the Council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing, at a later date.	0.9241755354801051
Question No 9 by (H-0044/00):	0.15496552040927533
Subject: Environmental problems caused by the Drogheda Port Company development project, and the role of the Court of Auditors A major conflict between environmental conservation and structural development interests has arisen in the area of the Boyne Estuary, Ireland, following a development project of the Drogheda Port Company.	0.764675377208263
The affected area is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. Many local and European associations have strongly criticised the project.	0.6062924859234927
Similar cases occur in other regions of the Union, where EU development funding conflicts with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measures.	0.5741072538995683
Is not the Council of the opinion that the Court of Auditors should be given more resources in order to investigate or review similar development measures where environmental conflicts arise?	0.8482222881710657
What kind of measures does the Council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the European institutions in similar cases?	0.8235869554635116
. (PT) In response to your question, Mrs McKenna, I would first of all like to highlight the fact that the role of the Court of Auditors was laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community.	0.9070378957702407
In accordance with Article 246 of the Treaty, the auditing of accounts is carried out by the Court of Auditors which, to this end, studies the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the Community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlying transactions. The Court also guarantees proper financial management.	0.8000208620107725
This is indeed also stipulated in Article 248.	0.5248679134349442
The Court of Auditors, therefore, already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role.	0.6818045129403272
With regard to your suggestion for increasing the Court' s resources, the Council considers that all of the Union' s institutions have, under the Community budget, the necessary financial means for them to be able to properly carry out their respective remits.	0.9526153900856194
In some cases, it would probably be desirable for their financial resources to be increased, but there are budgetary restraints of which I am sure you are aware.	0.986454305421125
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Budget of the European Union is approved by common agreement between the Council and this Parliament.	0.9397240232495198
The Council therefore, has no means of changing the role conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty.	0.7958759969679573
If extra resources were given to the Court of Auditors it would be money well spent, because it would ensure that EU funding was not going to something that conflicted with environmental concerns.	0.7479198169968616
For years the Council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes.	0.6753697401155786
I would ask you, now that you are President of the Council, will you push forward with this extremely important proposal.	0.9395225337867951
Secondly, as there is no mention of Structural Funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in?	1.0625188953612088
I would like to know what you could do about this as President-in-Office of the Council at the moment because it is the Council that has been blocking this for a long time.	1.0069364703217598
It is extremely important.	0.3089762243305619
If the Court of Auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development, it would be very important because the Court of Auditors could do an extremely good job.	0.7894941590882114
Their reports are extremely detailed and very important.	0.3469044432101112
This is the way to ensure that such conflicts are avoided in the future.	0.9601150407405047
- (PT) Mrs McKenna, a large part of the problem you have raised relates to issues which are the responsibility of the Commission.	0.913985284867717
It is therefore the Commission that must ensure that certain development projects comply with relevant environmental provisions.	0.7603864662589146
The Commission will have to provide specific answers to these questions.	0.7965434559688739
I do not think that I can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted.	0.8776601097843295
Question No 10 by (H-0053/00):	0.21261971896104503
Subject: Statute for Members of the European Parliament The Council and Parliament are going to try to reach agreement on a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament.	1.0162546235677525
One of the matters to be settled is whether Members are to receive equal pay, and where they are to pay tax.	0.9406405057333065
According to media reports the Portuguese Presidency considers that all Members should pay the same tax, to the EU. This is in conflict with the view taken by some Member States who wish to have the right to tax their Members in their home countries.	0.9699432472837861
Will the Portuguese Presidency clarify its position on this matter?	0.7369457877741645
. (PT) The Portuguese Presidency is particularly interested in this issue, as I suppose that this is the first time a presidency has made resolving the problem of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament a priority in its programme.	1.0134109175505919
The Portuguese Presidency made reaching an agreement on this statute one of its priorities, as furthermore, did the President of the European Parliament, when she stated this at the Helsinki European Council.	0.9097674793101564
We are therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter.	0.7143563902569507
We are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise, and we have already begun work on this matter.	0.9634508824804554
It is worth pointing out once more that this compromise will require the unanimous support of the Council, in accordance with Article 190, and the assent of this Parliament, to which it falls to approve this statute.	0.9302109422672512
The Presidency has engaged in intensive discussions with a range of Members of this Parliament and with the group to which Parliament entrusted the task of negotiating with the Council.	0.8219013117025606
I myself had an opportunity to meet this group, for the first time, in parallel with the January part-session, and I am trying to arrange to do so again soon in order to continue these discussions.	0.8783402003407439
These discussions have also recommenced more intensively in the relevant bodies of the Council, and I think that I can say, in a spirit of openness and greater flexibility, and because we all recognise the importance that this has, particularly for the general public, that drawing up this statute is a vital factor in ensuring both the dignity of the functions of Members of the European Parliament and the necessary transparency and good management of public funds.	1.024897271175165
With regard more specifically to your question, I would like to highlight the fact that it only makes sense to have a new statute if it represents progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensures that holders of identical posts are as far as possible treated in the same way.	0.7695669549399773
This has, from the outset, been the position of the Portuguese Presidency.	0.845925198897095
Nevertheless, our role as mediator means that we must take account of all current attitudes in the Council and I am sure you are aware, Mr Sjöstedt, that the tax issue poses problems for certain delegations.	1.121809930197744
As this is the case, whatever solution is found, I think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all Member States, regardless of their national positions on the matter.	0.9452349392175431
What I can promise with regard to this issue is that the presidency has the utmost commitment to working, for as long as it is involved with this matter, in an atmosphere of total transparency and openness towards Members of the European Parliament. We will also make the utmost effort with members of the Council, particularly with those who had most difficulty in accepting the proposal suggested last year, so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution, and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the members of this House.	1.050882060786594
Mr President, I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer. I want to ask two follow-up questions connected with the taxation of ourselves as parliamentarians.	0.8904256775171838
My basic view is that one ought to pay tax in the country in which one lives, in which one' s family lives and in which one benefits from public services.	0.9296403263050972
I intended to ask the presidency if there really is an argument for saying that we should not pay tax in our own countries just as other people do.	0.8186883336022128
Is there any argument for our being given a special privilege just because we are parliamentarians?	0.5937203431837645
That is my first question.	0.9656676128055971
My second question is about whether the Portuguese Presidency can accept a solution which involves the tax issue' s being solved in different ways for Members of different nationalities, or whether you want a solution which is identical for members of all nationalities.	0.7943210392086973
- (PT) Without wishing to show any lack of respect towards this House and particularly because of the respect that your questions deserve, I would rather not answer the questions you have raised immediately.	0.7800936573774538
We are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations.	0.598206744236374
This sensitivity is reflected in the way in which the Presidency of the Council of the European Union expresses itself in a specific context in relation to particular situations.	0.822551868897046
This has an impact of course, because it is read by other members of the Council.	0.8761822118764722
At this stage in the discussion, please forgive me if I cannot give a direct answer to the specific questions that have been put to me. I would ask that we be judged on our results, when we endeavour to reach a more concrete solution in the near future.	0.9515510839632627
I will be happy to come back to Parliament to respond to and clarify the problems which may conceivably occur if a result is not reached, or to congratulate all of you if this result is achieved.	0.8318714214877858
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, after his few hours working in this Chamber with these Members of the European Parliament, whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay?	0.835329808995042
Mr Purvis, as this discussion of salaries in the European Parliament does not relate exclusively to your country and even affects my country, I have a precise idea of what the salaries of the Members of the European Parliament are worth.	0.9984610907124083
I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem.	0.7657438364928412
Mr President, I want to thank you for your answer. I want to ask a follow-up question which bears some resemblance to the one Mr Sjöstedt asked.	0.8271841488342725
We both come from Sweden. In our country, we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local.	0.7611427964291254
We have extensive services, too. We have problems stemming from the lack of confidence in politicians and, not least, in European politicians here in Parliament.	0.9392098481566838
How do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education, health care etc - but, at the same time, did not pay any tax and did not contribute?	0.7038316957676677
How do you think a system like that would affect people' s confidence in ourselves as politicians?	0.5417801826635736
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question.	0.7230611600007263
However, if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy, go ahead!	0.7873397205071851
. Mr President, I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy.	0.851590230003671
These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society.	0.6800856495077001
I do not want to enter into this type of discussion because I think that it might, to use a French expression, préjuger the Portuguese Presidency' s views in the course of the negotiations in which it is involved on the Statute for Members.	0.9400618576080499
I would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter.	0.5389490232289471
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing.	0.6527094762040069
That concludes Questions to the Council.	0.5117553246197132
(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	0.34041027690150316
Address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic	0.3572105827510927
Mr President in office, ladies and gentlemen, I have great honour in extending a warm welcome, on behalf of the House, to the President of the Czech Republic, Mr Vaclav Havel.	0.8532929319372722
I should also like to welcome Mrs Havel, who is sitting in the gallery.	0.7904774894016262
You are most welcome.	0.26025603289109894
(Applause)	-0.0
This is not your first visit to our Parliament, Mr President.	0.8785180600463441
You addressed plenary in Strasbourg nearly six years ago, in March 1994, and many of us, who were already European Members of Parliament at that time, still have a vivid recollection of your speech.	0.9536567845103471
In fact, shortly after the Maastricht Treaty was ratified, you spoke in favour of strengthening European values, creating a European ethical dimension and opening the Union to the countries of central and eastern Europe.	0.6850293927029754
In other words, for many citizens, and not just in your country, you personify the European values to which we constantly voice our attachment.	0.9933238265956922
There have been extremely dynamic developments in relations between the Union and the Czech Republic following two European elections and a major new reform of the European Treaties.	0.8738747570570575
An association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the European Parliament and the Czech Parliament.	0.9151675473439749
Your country filed an official application to join the Union in 1996 and accession negotiations were finally officially opened in 1998.	0.5479377816580177
The process of European integration and enlargement has speeded up impressively since the fall of the iron curtain.	0.5598043063400925
The end of this artificial separation of Europe marked the start of a new era.	0.8424299321147781
We now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of Europe.	0.4956517964951787
Mr President, you are a symbol of these changes.	0.9084104400149658
You founded and signed Charter 77, the human rights movement which represented and called for fundamental values during a dark period in the history of your people.	0.5342009953396072
A Communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity.	0.4386491046761013
But you never lost hope and history proved you right.	0.2681146220264623
Ten years ago, the "velvet revolution" proclaimed Havel na HRAD.	0.5250481713391305
For ten years you represented democratic Czechoslovakia and, later, the Czech Republic, as its president.	0.7808740967880763
Reconciliation with your neighbours was, and still is, a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance.	0.8933468627492412
You are a first class European.	0.5439447843641761
Today, the Czech Republic is preparing to join our Union.	0.672241490838132
I am sure that you will agree, Mr President, and experience has shown us, that the process of enlargement of the Union is not without its pitfalls for both parties and the Czech Republic will need to make a great deal of effort in order to meet the accession criteria.	1.0138513638274957
The European Union, for its part, will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement.	0.9119904635528583
It has already taken a big step forward with Agenda 2000.	0.6114662554497389
The next step, i.e. institutional reform, will be taken following the inauguration of the new Intergovernmental Conference, in which the European Parliament will be fully involved.	1.0807557128468963
Our responsibility as members of the European Parliament is to ensure that the process of enlargement takes place in an climate of optimum openness and transparency so that, when the time comes, the citizens of the European Union and the citizens of the Czech Republic will approve the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union through their elected representatives.	0.9642886608159649
Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor.	0.9537457699523618
(Applause)	-0.0
Mr President, allow me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to extend our warmest thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation.	0.9036604620381541
Thank you. You are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a European identity.	0.8207436459498519
And you have used your personal experience to show us that your European identity was not decreed; it was a spontaneous and natural move.	0.6988924694683997
I have taken note of your words; this is something which we all feel very deeply.	0.9015212448884593
We find you faithful to the principles which have always guided you, which have always guided your actions; your attachment to fundamental values.	0.7254058832476009
You reminded us of your speech in 1994, which you yourself qualify as slightly provocative, but there is such a thing as creative utopia and we have been able to gauge together how far we have come.	0.8164708897627696
And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need.	1.0420430505612404
To summarise, perhaps what struck me most in your speech; above all, you wished to remind us that, beyond its economic aspects, the task of constructing Europe is a spiritual one.	0.7576825892928809
We of course look forward most keenly to continuing this task with you.	0.33865649780747553
Thank you, Mr President.	0.7403502137938218
(The formal sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)	0.4151623774157005
ACP-EU Joint Assembly	0.10320914847521043
The next item is the annual report (A5-0032/2000) by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the results of the activities of the ACS-EU Joint Assembly in 1999.	0.6402029007384987
, rapporteur.- Mr President, I had hoped to be rising at 9 a.m., not 9 p.m., to present this report.	0.934781537735992
I hope the number of Members in this Chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work.	0.9292681832352068
However, it is normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is put before Members of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing that tonight.	0.9841602769637036
Once again, I can report two highly successful Assemblies having taken place, one in Strasbourg and one in Nassau.	0.8866674560377857
In many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one.	0.8542978159957565
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly is a unique organisation in world politics.	0.49301593277410055
Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern?	0.42586548409576697
The Strasbourg Assembly was the last chaired by Lord Plumb.	0.3290279617006512
In honour of the tremendous work he carried out over a difficult period the Joint Bureau in Nassau made him an honorary president, and we wish him well in his retirement.	0.7024635305293928
The two Assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the Lomé Convention and I look forward to the signature of a new Convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned.	0.749529974945387
I remember that at the last mid-term review, when I was rapporteur, the then Commissioner Marin said that review would be the last.	0.9435754365608208
Well, he was wrong, and I pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new Convention in very difficult circumstances.	0.7893460765866558
I was also delighted to hear the report this morning from Commissioner Nielson who has worked untiringly to get the right outcome to the negotiations.	0.7167232338176871
I pay special tribute to him for his success.	0.35981736547093296
I also pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock and her working group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of Lomé.	0.6470001909298733
I am quite sure that Mrs Kinnock' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations.	0.9208117304518517
I also thank the Working Groups on the small island states and climate change and the Follow-up Group on Fisheries for their excellent reports.	0.5899118579934455
We have had question times to the Council and the Commission and to the ACP Council, and I would like to thank those institutions for their interest in our work.	1.0799017363115715
The main thrust of our work in both Assemblies was poverty eradication.	0.5432591926694483
The resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights.	0.643737578047839
It also emphasised the importance of abolishing gender inequalities and as I travel through Africa and see the work done by women I only wish there were more women in senior government positions and in presidential posts.	0.47693199991092006
We might then see an end to some of the fraud, corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some countries and that have to be stopped.	0.6834187573144563
We had, as usual, many debates on countries where there are war situations.	0.7824968496446593
I visited Ethiopia and Eritrea to gain first-hand knowledge.	0.33079502722377335
The OAU is doing its best to broker a peace deal there.	0.3932329606922842
But Ethiopia is still calling for clarification on certain issues and the humanitarian situation in both countries is serious.	0.47404570852799005
We were delighted to hear in Nassau that a trade agreement was being reached with South Africa after four years of negotiations.	0.4692673456114903
This highlights the problems of coherence between the EU and the developing nations, which came to a head at the WTO talks in Seattle.	0.848592874120783
Much work has to be done to convince the developing nations of the advantages of globalisation and world free-trade agreements.	0.8058185170119868
In Nassau, we had two interesting debates on East Timor and Cuba.	0.7478940097093084
Cuba has observer status but I understand has now shown a wish to join the ACP.	0.592714167577936
All nations from within the confines of the ACP territory who can live up to the requirements of democracy, human rights, governance and an independent judiciary are, I am sure, welcome.	0.8041656680887364
I await with interest developments in Cuba.	0.2719204747381405
When Mr Dalmau, the Cuban Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Assembly, he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known.	0.5946459712366512
On East Timor, Mr Da Costa, from the Timorese National Resistance Council, gave a very moving address indicating that East Timor would also like to join the ACP when it becomes a state with a government.	0.6978279506100509
We must give them all our support to reach that goal.	0.6184383442207003
Human rights is such an important issue within the ACP-EU Assembly that Joint Vice-Presidents have been appointed with special responsibilities for monitoring human rights closely and reporting to the Assembly.	0.6203001704407772
A number of cases have been highlighted, including the child soldier issue in Sudan, where many children have been abducted from neighbouring states.	0.6175689811654744
I had the honour of being elected the European Co-President at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President.	0.6652836813520211
I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly, particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May.	0.980374858149545
We must have more equality between our ACP partners and our European members and I want to get rid of the "them and us" syndrome.	0.6014814699146177
Firstly, I would like to see a Joint Parliamentary Assembly of elected members from ACP countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates.	0.6299987486478438
This I think is the new Convention.	0.949775292852524
Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work.	0.9930899559950523
These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly.	0.6547390230863819
We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive.	0.785667570899913
We are going to have one in Abuja in West Africa too.	0.554910783964772
I want the Assembly to stop being just a talk-shop and become a work-shop for the betterment of all the people in developing countries.	0.6702959702313888
I want to see civil society given a louder voice.	0.5660035908893218
But to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on.	1.0435696625300552
We must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance.	0.6493501866843918
Equally, we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand.	0.7541109119173786
I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe.	0.723004079370714
European taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used.	0.40026819870432423
A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to.	0.4369975465004098
The Joint Assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance, human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission.	0.781053889025526
I believe that as equal partners the EU- and ACP-elected delegates are up to that task.	0.7455309006089768
I beg to move acceptance of this report.	0.5234998928845342
Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report.	0.7527493401358228
Our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty.	0.7867093575107658
But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU.	0.7335154456394549
With regard to financing, we must look to the future and provide the Joint Assembly with additional funds so that, for instance, we can send delegations to the ACP states to oversee electoral processes, at their invitation.	1.0859012428489678
In future, the EU must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and, furthermore, must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively.	0.7809263451985289
An example here could be the field of education, which will deserve and need special support in the ACP states in future.	0.899821390265202
For instance, the very rapidly growing educational and technological potential of the Internet offers entirely new means of helping the developing countries, which at present still have modest resources, to move towards a global approach, as opposed to globalisation.	0.8461392637419851
I see it as a future task of the EU to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises in the ACP states, which can promote self-help.	1.0519041076923743
An example here is the problem in Nigeria, which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers.	0.7275934578949673
One way forward to promote the setting up of SMEs could be to train the Nigerian population adequately.	0.5352112380951737
It will be easier to take account of the developing countries' very diverse problems, and EU aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if, as the report makes quite clear, we take the urgently needed step of optimising our working methods, by introducing the proposed regional assemblies.	0.8600522677977458
Thank you, Mr Zimmerling: If I am informed correctly, this is the first time you are addressing this House.	1.0559863878976872
Congratulations on your maiden speech: It went really well.	0.4260978739191322
Mr President, it cannot be repeated often enough: since 1975, the Lomé Convention has constituted an important pillar of European development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects.	0.8394319837856907
Based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality, and on parliamentary control by the Joint Assembly, it is an example to the world.	1.1328917751577066
Most appropriately, given that this year we are celebrating 25 years of cooperation under Lomé, we will shortly be signing a new and more advanced partnership agreement, which also upgrades the Joint Assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both sides.	0.81849422959603
So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999.	0.8896097880043575
The rapporteur, Mr Corrie, has already done so most expertly.	0.8471959856369592
Much of what concerns us today is the outcome of fundamental processes of transformation in all parts of the world since the late 1980s.	0.7282555678249908
They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries.	0.36550421760627255
The after-shocks can still be felt.	0.3126709095772196
ACP cooperation is a dynamic process.	0.3250581111515737
The content of the agreements has progressed steadily between Lomé I and Lomé VI.	0.46786929654490467
At the same time the number of partner states has increased considerably, now standing at 71.	0.6636627581765728
All those involved were particularly moved by the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa.	0.551941566872937
Cuba has just knocked at the door, and, if Cuba is also accepted into the ACP-EU community, that will be a momentous step and will bring in its wake processes of change in Cuba itself.	0.86625038463476
So ACP cooperation remains very exciting, and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new Convention.	1.1277395130075467
Fighting poverty and promoting sustained economic, cultural and social development are important objectives in the endeavour to build up democratic societies, based on respect for human rights, in the ACP states.	0.7513784821790842
That also means strengthening the democratic institutions.	0.333401819705842
The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction.	0.6641794404034225
In the past, the representatives of the ACP countries tended to be government members, government officials or ambassadors; but today at least three quarters of the ACP delegates are elected members of parliament.	0.809496257199027
We ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100% in the near future, which is indeed what the new Convention is aiming at.	0.749017666961704
Unfortunately there is far too little appreciation of the steady advance of processes of democratisation which, unlike the various crises that arise, largely pass unnoticed.	0.5929733550085855
One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP states is regional cooperation and integration.	0.6873555648932705
There is one wish on the European Parliament' s long wish list that will be fulfilled: as we have already heard, the Joint Assembly will soon also be able to hold regional assemblies.	0.9135213766002885
Enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic, economic, social or religious factors, i.e. have a preventive effect.	0.6246154452260866
For the same reason the European Parliament has always called for civil society to be involved in the decision-making processes and in cooperation management, and emphasised the importance of decentralised cooperation.	0.8305465863507473
The enhanced contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners provided for in the new Convention are another step in the right direction.	0.796139177352392
But I am a little sad that the European Development Fund has still not been incorporated in the Community budget.	0.9923826196700753
I hope it does not take another 25 years before we finally achieve that too.	0.5663932286231287
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Corrie on his report.	0.8631745122242823
The Lomé Convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the EU and the ACP countries for over 25 years.	0.8917379396539707
That it has continued at all in the face of overwhelming pressure against it from many quarters, including the WTO, is a triumph of sorts.	0.7851154824355269
But of course the new Convention must be measured not by the fact that it exists but by the extent to which it can contribute to the EU commitment to poverty eradication and the achievement of the international development targets.	0.958106879735032
Measured by this yardstick there are a number of serious shortcomings in the new arrangements. For example, the agreement is particularly disappointing for those ACP countries suffering from short-term fluctuations in export earnings.	0.6750096445891736
During a marathon negotiating session in December a compromise was reached which provided that, in respect of least-developed, landlocked and island states, assistance would be provided in the event of a minimum 2% loss of export earnings rather than the level of 10% for the other ACP states.	0.7013564006472871
But at the final negotiating session the EU claimed that it had never actually agreed to the inclusion of islands and landlocked states among those which would qualify for the support on the basis of the 2% threshold.	0.6176437362677243
This change has been devastating for the Windward Islands in particular which may be the only ACP state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangements.	0.5874264540751116
This seems a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the ACP states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new Lomé arrangement.	0.7668284531386906
Meanwhile, on the trade side, pressure from the WTO to ensure that any Lomé Convention is WTO-compatible has meant that there is a huge momentum behind the idea of the so-called regional economic partnership arrangements or free-trade agreements.	0.6516774692240929
Non-least-developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements.	0.49763301536717525
Yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the chill winds of free trade without wrecking their own domestic economy.	0.5841588343830575
We therefore need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that genuine options are open to those countries which are not yet ready for free-trade arrangements.	0.8568185593641712
We need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the ACP are pursued in their own right.	0.6707858440101455
Finally, during any new trade round the EU and the ACP states should press jointly for a reform of GATT Article 24 in order to explicitly provide regional non-reciprocal trade agreements between structurally and economically dissimilar groups of countries.	0.5927025292891227
The Lomé Convention is a unique partnership; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of Lomé and involve a participation of the WTO and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora.	0.7990772984496439
Mr President, what I want to do in this debate is condemn the fate reserved for the poor countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.	1.0127515095919328
People have the gall to say they benefit from the Lomé Convention, but even looking at trading relations alone, the Lomé Convention has done nothing to protect those countries; their already feeble share in trade with Europe has been halved.	0.6804632818151534
That reflects the growth of inequality between EU and ACP countries.	0.37006240679425684
The Lomé Convention essentially benefits a few large industrial or financial conglomerates, which continue to pillage those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence, notably on the former colonial powers.	0.5862559521905578
When it comes to so-called development aid, given that underdevelopment in the majority of these countries is getting worse rather than better, development is clearly not what the aid is for, even when it is not just a disguised export subsidy for European manufacturers.	0.8768399898183711
The aid is primarily a windfall for incumbent regimes, and the poor majority does not benefit at all.	0.7413112346130797
Even if it were properly redirected this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care, education or drinking water supply.	0.7892042047686343
For some years now the great powers have been reducing the amount of this already derisory aid, and it is the height of cynicism when this is done on the pretext of human rights violations or corruption.	0.8042301060474288
After all, who protects these deeply corrupt regimes, if not the governments of the rich countries?	0.878570566685153
They turn a blind eye to the masters of corruption, the big groups controlling oil, water supply, or public works. They could clamp down on them since their head offices are here in Europe.	0.7672561356761508
The debate about either extending the Lomé Convention with its quotas and protectionism, or, instead, gradually winding down the special relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries in the name of free trade, is a warped debate between two ways of perpetuating the pillage and impoverishment of those countries.	0.7812331194692875
I protest against an ignoble and inhuman organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a wretched death to enrich a minority.	0.38321510516031965
A mere fraction of the fantastic wealth accumulated by the big groups could lift these poor countries out of extreme poverty, but, until we have the courage to take on those big capitalist groups, we are just covering up the real problems.	0.7595619496428291
Mr President, I want to thank the Co-President of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly, Mr Corrie. It was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the ACP-EU Assembly.	0.9885244564008007
In this speech, I will confine myself to addressing certain points I consider fundamental.	0.7153451433465583
I believe the European Parliament should call for the Assembly to become truly parliamentary, urging all ACP countries to send members of their national parliaments as their representatives, so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric.	0.7657140217749263
My next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the WTO, which is seen by the ACP countries as an enormous danger to their development.	0.8504241867336702
I do believe the ACP countries need a transition period, but they also need support in the context of the new logic of regionalisation of aid, not only in agriculture and fisheries, but also in the exploitation of mineral and underground resources, some of which are being exploited, with slim economic returns to the ACP countries themselves.	1.0123133042541097
Thirdly, the European Parliament - through a joint working group within the Joint Assembly - must make a major effort to achieve stability in ACP countries' budgets through the selection of budgetary items to permit economic and, above all, social development, and by monitoring income and fiscal policies in force in the ACP countries.	0.896006828295467
We must put the people of the ACP countries first in our relationship with their rulers, who need to be fully aware that development aid from the European Union is intended for the people and not for the oligarchies that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries.	0.9677906071757617
Fourthly, and finally, the prevention of inter-ethnic conflicts between States must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals I have set out.	0.7768956578771662
Mr President, I agree with the positive evaluation Mrs Junker has just made and I want to add that Mr Corrie has started his term as Co-President of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly with effective and impartial work deserving of our full appreciation.	0.6543282023212607
I shall restrict my speech to one particular act which took place a few days ago, partly as a consequence of events alluded to in the report we are debating here.	0.768045508029198
I refer to Cuba' s expression of intent, of 2 February, to become a full member of the ACP group of countries.	0.9403947163009413
A Cuban delegation attended the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, and Vice-Chancellor Dalmau spoke in the plenary session, engaging in a lively debate, and afterwards held conversations with many of us.	0.7255009224426267
Following Nassau, a delegation from Parliament led by Mr Corrie and the Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Joaquín Miranda, visited Havana and a series of very illuminating exchanges of opinion took place.	0.6069906933236761
It is my impression that this mission from the European Parliament was the final push which convinced our Cuban friends that the time had come to move forward on mechanisms of cooperation with the European Union.	0.8107100648489886
We are witnessing events of great political significance and I hope that we in the European Parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union, so that Cuba' s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible.	0.818345069637527
That is important, for at least three reasons.	0.8463866580735843
First, it is important for Cuba, to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the United States blockade, which has been repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations.	1.0400884288775383
Secondly, we must bear in mind that Cuba' s application has the support of all the ACP countries.	0.9443945856424957
If the European Union responds positively to the recommendation of our associates, we will be proving our respect and consideration for those associates and this will have positive effects on the whole framework of our cooperation with them.	0.8402499729181165
Nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter.	0.7617596452331387
By accepting Cuba into the ACP community we will be demonstrating that our Europe is not involved in the shameful process of 'playing but not paying' , and that, when we get indignant about absurdities like the Helms-Burton Act, we are not being hypocritical but are ready to act and take all the consequences.	0.7987420743128041
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly meets again in a few weeks time and I am sure this subject will be dealt with there.	0.783353046600919
Ideally the European Parliament' s representatives should be able to support Cuba' s intent at those proceedings, as our parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries will no doubt be doing.	0.7539301384686432
Of course, Cuba must meet all the standard conditions, just like any other member.	0.7290995263359032
The Cubans know that and I am sure they accept it.	0.8521458860856276
It must also be made clear that Cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners.	0.7762610721269338
Cuba' s wish to join is welcome and Cuba will be welcome in our circle.	0.5217854040800505
I say that wholeheartedly, but also with the deep conviction that, just as the blockade has produced nothing but poverty and, as a consequence of that, extreme tension and a hardening of the Cuban position, the integration we are supporting here, and the prosperity it will produce, will translate into the détente and openness we all seek and from which all of us, especially the Cuban people, will benefit.	0.8985363587672054
Mr President, I also want to begin by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Corrie, for an excellent report which I think very well describes and summarises the work which has been done in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in the course of 1999.	0.9899138575584889
I do not have very long in which to speak, and I really only want to take up two questions.	1.0538534365510408
The first is about the fight against poverty, which I think is becoming an embarrassment both for the EU and the Member States.	1.1480595585731295
In spite of the fact that, both in the Treaty and at the UN' s meetings in Rio and Copenhagen, there was an undertaking to work to eradicate poverty in the world, the budget for development aid is, in actual fact, being cut back, when the express desire was that exactly the opposite should happen.	1.005111286397817
We must put a stop to this trend.	0.5499039346282308
We must begin by writing off debts. We must follow up words with action.	0.6653581966688898
I should like us to take a leading role in this work.	0.9242689572664963
My second question concerns the fact that, in many contexts, we talk about the ACP countries having to learn the principles of democracy.	1.0070365807643094
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution demand, within the context of the new agreement, that working methods should be developed and optimised.	0.9858791890066014
The ACP countries are to be urged to allow a whole range of political opinions to come up for discussion.	0.7345307608981214
I think that is a very good idea indeed, and I fully subscribe to it.	1.1863853162462856
However, we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements.	0.9528522292346747
How do these operate within the European Parliament' s delegation to the ACP-EU' s Joint Assembly?	0.77251124976348
In contrast to how things are done here in the European Parliament and in Parliament' s committees, where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports, there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the Joint Assembly. The two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves.	0.854018282771053
In order to change this undemocratic arrangement, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have tabled Amendment No 6 in which we request that the rapporteurs appointed to produce reports and consultative documents, together with the members of working parties, should be appointed in accordance with clear, democratic rules.	0.7978033575451553
In this context, account ought to be taken of the smaller groups, and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements.	0.792786532472053
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the quality of his report, which appropriately reflects the tenor of the debates in the Joint Assembly he so effectively co-chaired.	0.7710565617908197
The eradication of poverty was central to our work and many speakers highlighted the need to preserve an essential tool for achieving that ambitious aim, to whit, preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries within the framework of the Lomé Conventions.	0.7589982160265208
The challenge was immense.	0.18958910862196493
Globalisation, free trade, and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy, were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue.	0.8129956600505036
So we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development, and personally I am convinced that the work of the last Joint Assembly did have a decisive influence on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations, as did the new climate created by the events at Seattle.	0.897712772080958
However, while I welcome the renewal of the agreements, what I find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close.	0.8209129055063821
The European Union seems to me to have finally emerged from the old paternalist, or frankly neo-colonialist, logic where those giving aid are all too eager to start giving lessons, following a formula our friend Michel Rocard is so keen on.	0.6069438592471327
The Union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners.	0.7078053975467706
By refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool, in the hands of technocrats, for imposing new sets of conditions, the European Union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty.	0.9385921118375191
We have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events.	0.4872049101939112
What right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history, values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own?	0.44845906291080456
Personally, I prefer the willingness that is clearly flagged up in these agreements to extend the partnership to new agents - local authorities, non-governmental organisations - which seems to me to represent the only possible way the people of these countries can progressively achieve ownership cooperation.	0.8308852716163131
In short, this is the only way they can emerge from humiliating and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves, the proof of success.	0.7980144638807413
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the accuracy and rigour of the summary in his report.	0.7140393832431922
The European Parliament' s opinion on the activities of the ACP-European Union Joint Assembly has always had a major impact, undeniably contributing to a consistent policy and role for the European Union in development and cooperation.	0.8734610239690783
The important role of the increasingly parliamentary Joint Assembly in strengthening relations between the European Union and the ACP countries needs to be stressed.	0.8219960002587529
In view of this positive action, there is every advantage to be gained from according the Joint Assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work.	0.7249666518940207
We back the rapporteur' s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies, under the aegis of the Joint Assembly, in the six regions of the Convention: the Caribbean, the Pacific and four African regions.	0.8387991801597483
These regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas.	0.4949138198992127
Poverty has been the common denominator of all the debates in the Joint Assembly and its eradication is the priority for the European Union' s development policy.	0.759026324770878
In line with the resolution at the Nassau meeting, we must concentrate on meeting the poverty reduction targets agreed by the international community.	0.7785239112827651
Consistency and action are needed.	0.25002570408814145
The next Lomé Convention must specify the investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and the participation of local bodies.	0.589994015459078
The participation of local bodies is absolutely essential.	0.5331820797123815
In a wider context, the priorities, as I see it, are to convert poor countries' debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development, as well as control of fraud and corruption.	0.8380440021144488
We need to make progress with concrete and consistent action.	0.806409810899384
People in the poor countries are beginning to despair.	0.6905637661750711
I call on the Commission to act on the rapid accession of East Timor to the Lomé Convention as one means, amongst others, of promoting the eradication of poverty and accelerating its economic, cultural and social development, in order to strengthen its internal democratisation.	0.832088091134746
Finally, I must congratulate the Council Presidency on the coming Europe-Africa Summit and call on all the participants to contribute to solid practical action to promote the development of peace, democracy and the eradication of poverty in the underdeveloped countries of Africa.	0.8541804838575612
. (DA) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the Joint Assembly for its work in 1999.	0.8634800290701165
I am also delighted to be able to confirm that I shall be participating in the Joint Assembly' s next meeting, which takes place in March in Nigeria.	0.9387061139487364
The Commission is pleased to see the Joint Assembly playing a larger role, especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development.	0.8783538271709923
The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty continues to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role.	0.7679519239858738
In order to be able to develop, the countries concerned must, however, become actively involved in the global economic system.	0.7706941091136709
With regard to trade with our partners in development, the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries' special economic and social limitations.	0.9225032887469207
Mrs Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continued with.	0.42974203705485003
I do not agree.	0.8008905690870727
That system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is, in actual fact, of use only to relatively few of the 71 countries concerned.	0.7780675477233523
It operates too slowly, and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future, because this will operate more flexibly.	0.9823473314316055
Regarding the future accession of countries such as East Timor to the Lomé Convention, I can only repeat what I recently said to the European Parliament' s Committee on Development and Cooperation, namely, that the door is open.	0.8470311903065376
It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door.	0.6713707060263201
Once they have done so, we shall adopt a position on the matter.	0.9799601952672902
With regard to Cuba' s application for accession to the Lomé Convention, the Commission notes that, according to their recent declaration, the ACP States support Cuba' s application.	0.8303628742033983
The EU has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards Cuba, as outlined in the EU' s common position, but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex.	0.9448210921520221
With regard to the Côte d' Ivoire, I can inform you that the whole of the EUR 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities.	0.923672668198497
With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget, I can say that this is being considered.	1.034544052332669
For its part, the Commission supports this, but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the whys and wherefores.	1.0065732867302386
Concerning Article 366A, I can say that, during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement, a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed.	1.0176751221301998
It is now the case, following adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty, that Parliament wishes, on the basis of Article 300, to be kept fully informed of all decisions, and the Commission will continue to take account of Parliament' s decisions on this subject.	1.1118218944544156
There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions.	0.6731955487556707
This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty.	0.43699078322647106
Finally, I would refer to the South Africa agreement, which the rapporteur also touched upon.	1.0948891944146681
In this regard, I am simply pleased - delighted, in fact - here this evening, as a conclusion to this debate, to be able, very appropriately, to inform you that South Africa' s President has today said yes to the solution which the EU' s Council of Foreign Ministers last Monday agreed unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problems regarding South Africa.	0.9268365640571282
So the "Grappa War" is over.	0.4851910115912061
Peace has broken out, and we can now look forward to cooperation with South Africa in accordance with the common dreams and values which ought to have underpinned the whole business from the start.	0.8377258887463797
I think this rather nicely puts the finishing touches to a debate which has, on the whole, been quite positive, and I would repeat my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the cooperation which has gone into our relations with the Third World on precisely the work in question.	0.9896894084824591
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6002529528362665
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	0.15701726649154044
Stabilisation and association agreement with FYROM	0.3527465067305853
The next item is the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with FYROM (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121(COS)).	0.5698257918954798
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, today we are discussing a country that really has suffered hard times, a country that is, however, moving in a very promising direction, thanks to its own efforts and resolve and certainly also thanks to the support of the international community.	0.9173196764175292
So if the European Union, the Council and the Commission are proposing - and I assume that Parliament will support that proposal tomorrow - the first stabilisation and association agreement in south-eastern Europe, in the Balkan region - I am quite happy to use that term - it is primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that FYROM itself has worked its way into a good position, in economic and, of course, mainly in political terms, in face of the war in the neighbouring region and also in relation to its own minority.	1.017765633881468
For it is no small thing to have a minority of 33% or even 35% in one' s own country.	1.007042389437116
That country and its politicians - no doubt with some differences here and there - have always done very good work, and we should recognise that.	0.9115617285861006
The Commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the Council.	0.9623215458209504
Let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat, although, even in this regard, I want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge Commissioner Patten' s activities and interest in relation to FYROM and the region as a whole.	0.7609014153276535
Firstly, there is the regional approach.	0.9340852531585243
I believe that if it is understood properly, the regional approach is both important and necessary.	0.9417544923995232
There has to be a willingness to cooperate.	0.8426077201001534
Provided it is not seen as some kind of constraint but as a willingness to cooperate, as an opportunity that each country should grasp, then this is the right approach.	1.0135635644440435
The problem is that, when we look at FYROM, we can see how very difficult it is to cooperate economically with some neighbouring countries, such as Kosovo and Albania, or to cooperate politically with, for instance, Yugoslavia.	0.9749415712138532
On the other hand, cooperation with Bulgaria, and in particular with Greece, has made good progress and I think we should acknowledge that too.	0.9595186999677783
In this context, the European Union must consider, as it began to do early this week, how to include the neighbouring Yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything, i.e. without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime.	0.8775647352375292
Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation.	0.6696754971308514
In that regard allow me to say, since I come from a country through which the Danube flows, that I am grateful that the Commission, i.e. Commissioner Patten and also Vice-President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, is considering opening the Danube to shipping again. That would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too, which, of course, would be of particular importance to Romania.	0.9809385184869505
In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt.	1.0220714764505194
As I said, it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition.	0.7534985543744963
Secondly, let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union.	0.7747186793572809
In our view, it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now, but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date.	0.7760624121291566
FYROM wants to be told here and now that, in principle, accession will be possible when the time is right.	0.8267679465639068
This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined.	0.9612316612455271
It sees, in the whole readjustment of aid instruments, a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards Europe but that this train will continue through Europe while leaving FYROM on a siding.	0.7880134140736045
I think Commissioner Patten understands that too.	0.2710056642794946
So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks.	0.802575494267422
Thirdly, I believe that, so far at least, FYROM has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly.	0.9366788058013823
Even though there will of course be readjustments here, FYROM will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being dealt with in Brussels today can in future be handled in Skopje, in the country itself.	0.8470067799463341
I hope that the honourable Members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM.	0.8404507122944045
Mr President, since the start of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this abbreviation - has behaved as a constructive peace-keeper.	0.935015917091433
We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view.	0.8249538007247568
As you can see, our Macedonian friends have always played a very positive role and it is for this reason that it should be pointed out at this stage that Macedonia is not just a pawn in our so-called strive towards stability, but actually took the initiative.	0.8564650241413196
The former President, Mr Gligorov, can take special credit for this, and the current President too has already adopted the profile of President of all Macedonian citizens, so much so that the European Union should only be grateful to have him as interlocutor in the Balkans.	0.876267899614309
Despite the obvious reasons for any internal tension, both population groups have struck a reasonable modus vivendi and the outlook for reaching a sound solution to the remaining problems is good.	0.5691715887690479
It was, in fact, in Macedonia that I heard at the time about the Roma population actually not having too bad a time there.	0.7269876096067542
I was unaccustomed to hearing this type of comment about the Roma in Europe.	0.3928223287829865
With regard to the problems afflicting Macedonia, higher education for the Albanian-speaking citizens deserves our special attention.	0.5891589441537303
Accessible higher education, with which you have a certain affinity, is an important instrument in the emancipation of population groups. I am speaking from personal experience as someone who attended the Protestant university in Amsterdam.	0.9679292225465268
I might never have studied otherwise.	0.26232116202473293
Such an affinity and this type of higher education is also important in the development of the constitutional state and for the aptly termed mainstream society which needs to be strengthened in countries like this.	0.7568459246584418
The agreement with Macedonia should partly compensate for the damage which this country incurred following the boycott we instituted against Serbia, which is at no cost to us but costs Serbia' s neighbouring states all the more.	0.6766554010155293
It would be beneficial if we could reorganise this, especially vis-à-vis the neighbouring states.	0.7169389500614225
It is only fair that we should regulate aid to Macedonia properly now.	0.7423824556190975
We are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals' amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states' interests, for we need to give industry in Macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction.	0.8277630340590987
I am more than happy to include Bulgaria and Romania in this, as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former Yugoslavia, plus Albania.	0.7240824298107988
It is important to us that the economies in the region can stand on their own two feet again, which can quite easily be done with the aid money.	1.0291982069905672
The agreement with Macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the European Union, allowing this country to join, even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future.	0.905228041309106
In the meantime, we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for Macedonian legislation to resemble that of the Member States, and our policy should reflect this, even in the naming of aid programmes for Macedonia.	0.865808457075927
I would quote the PHARE programme as an example.	0.614424367243753
Mr President, the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivities surrounding it.	0.8959678447130739
I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic.	0.6980065933278922
If certain countries wish to use the words "former Yugoslavia" , then that is their business; others need not feel obliged to copy them.	0.6093879215543275
It will not do to keep us under constant pressure.	0.650226531926852
Hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda; we have come to expect nothing less of him, and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia.	0.8908280396654833
Mr President, let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda' s work as rapporteur.	0.6572963398580446
Today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia.	0.756969264224107
We do so in the awareness that this decision, the very first relating to that area, is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the Balkans.	0.8912665792919799
This new phase, or rather policy, identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully.	0.6357757488742707
Our agreement to the negotiations, as set out in the rapporteur' s explanatory statement, is born of the conviction that it is right for Union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the acquis communautaire.	0.7476602269884842
This is the dual objective which I believe should be pursued. On the one hand, we must maintain programmes on, for example, infrastructure, preparations - still premature - for free trade, and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area, and on the other, it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an example of the policy.	0.978694911293512
And there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive.	0.7462100090819775
As we were able to ascertain during our missions to Skopje, there has been considerable progress in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as regards the economy, movement towards democracy and - an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the Balkans - multi-ethnic coexistence.	0.8100679856827734
On the other hand, the price Macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring Kosovo is very high, both in terms of logistic availability of NATO forces and in terms of reduced exports to Northern Europe.	0.6554800080862845
I conclude, Mr President, by affirming that this progress is indeed difficult, fragile, and uncertain and it calls for constant vigilance on our part during the various stages of close and precise inspection that have long been advocated.	0.6286313648448161
Mr President, Commissioner, I rise to express the warmth and optimism with which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the start of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	0.6708525452203402
We are extremely hopeful that, along the lines set out by the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries, especially Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosovo and, as soon as possible, Serbia.	0.8425835476793401
We are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the Kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence, with all the consequences of that in terms of continental, if not world, instability.	0.8499746427750554
If the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia. And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent.	0.8977278657626838
It is in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement.	0.7324308474796409
Very rapid and direct involvement of south-east Europe in the life of the European institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the European Parliament, and that staff from those countries could work in the Court of Justice and the Commission.	0.9432434787623034
But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development.	0.8321996684148324
With this in mind, we have presented some amendments which I hope Parliament will accept.	0.917620229432209
First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted.	0.6777529748020978
Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system.	0.7996518698326528
Thirdly, world aid and assistance coming into the region, and hence into Macedonia as well, should be clearly multilateral, and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country.	0.7505990240504937
Mr President, Commissioner, we hope the agreement can achieve all its objectives but we cannot delude ourselves that peace, stability and prosperity in south-east Europe can be achieved without dealing with the very wide-ranging problems we are trying to eliminate.	0.7661955145361775
I am referring to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, the need to involve Serbia in the region' s reconciliation process and - why not? - new discussions on relations between the European Union, NATO and the UN, in the light of the new balance that needs to be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty, which I think calls for a change in the existing UN Charter.	0.9012926989184978
Mr President, Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has knocked everything off balance.	0.719288836243363
This is certainly true for the relations between the European Union and the western Balkans.	0.8958213729926806
Since then, expectations have been high.	0.4399161465093968
This applies to them and us.	0.6984205488041703
This is true on their part because - whether we like it or not - they are asking us for direct aid and they are wondering what Europe wants from them at the end of the day?	0.776902747588719
Is there any prospect of membership?	0.4575818790872944
This is very much on their minds.	0.7753430832820858
But here too, within the European Union, expectations are high.	0.6385309001898957
If we do things properly, this may well be a first taster of a genuine common foreign and security policy.	0.779733992756057
Will the Union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy, for the first time, concerning such a difficult regulation?	0.7905809863205964
It also remains to be seen whether the European Union has learnt any lessons from the bad experiences in Bosnia when it comes to providing aid and the slightly better experiences in Kosovo.	0.6583363520505742
Can we, based on the experiences in Macedonia and in four other countries, improve on this?	0.6228778132909728
Against this background of extremely high expectations, I do not think that I am exaggerating if I say that this first step, namely the stability and association agreement with Macedonia, is vitally important.	1.0199444055172548
This is not the Union' s only contribution.	0.7892863557189476
The debate on the Stability Pact, the debate on the CARA programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending.	0.8124308356320095
We are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements, that is to say a medium-term issue.	0.9777668900283534
This is why I think that this first agreement with Macedonia is so crucial, because it serves as a model.	0.9810419744794187
I am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen.	0.6322273242625057
What does the European Union intend to do with Macedonia?	0.9116999467752723
Will it do the same to us?	0.4550447262626457
This first step is so important because of this model function.	0.8143114608908628
Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason.	0.4498816959583346
The rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms, namely, the issue of interethnic relations.	0.7650753160750333
There is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture.	0.7029427401882994
During the presidential elections, it appeared that things were not running too smoothly, but compared to the rest of the region, Macedonia could serve as a model.	0.7497969211900307
We would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonians.	0.5782652620143627
This model function also applies to regional cooperation.	0.5330684679037928
I could not agree more with the rapporteur: a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece, and not cutting them off on the other.	0.8589534590977398
Mr President, Commissioner, if we manage this first step successfully, we will have gained a great deal.	0.9730946696067169
If we mess it up, then we will have lost a great deal more.	0.8618769219806316
Mr President, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle.	0.8358838975424628
I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support.	0.8715285978673806
I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia.	0.4371444817183534
Do not misunderstand me: I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime.	0.8039734603181171
But firstly, these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too, including Macedonia, which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is.	0.8651950087784572
Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive.	0.865204032405458
So I believe that we should take today' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10.	1.0214228111664898
Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe.	0.8508180326460385
This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region.	0.7793905209936888
The European Union' s contribution under the Stability Pact, now converted into what is called the "stabilisation and association process" , represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, and it should therefore contribute to regional stability.	0.8149404285755337
So establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis, and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process, constitutes an important contribution to stability in the Balkans.	0.7451248358738863
The assumption is that the countries are prepared to accept a certain set of conditions.	0.6891598309634139
The expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day, maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course.	0.8004385701175577
We are not deluding ourselves by believing that, once agreement is obtained, the mandate we are giving the Commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long-suffering region, where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development.	0.9043333564816735
They have suffered enough, first under the Soviet yoke and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc.	0.5805344630217443
The evidence is that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is politically and economically capable of establishing new contractual relations with the European Union, going beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 June 1998, which in practice targets respect for the acquis communautaire, especially in key areas of the internal market.	0.7896964844516826
It is true that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia still has a long way to go, but, given the political and economic reforms already made in the context of the cooperation agreement, and with transitional periods accepted for certain domains, the country will be able to fulfil the conditions for a stabilisation and association agreement.	0.8966554173580498
We share the view that its development is a factor for stability in the region, we approve the terms of the negotiating mandate as proposed, emphasising that what is involved is a bilateral agreement with the European Union, and we agree with the rapporteur when he stresses that this is the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south-east Europe, and that the issue is how the Balkans can be structured in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability.	0.9906049312680071
The various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context.	0.6264696150416097
This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region.	0.8848784034894702
That is why it is so important.	0.817428755272036
The point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the European Union to draw closer to these countries.	0.7947748107630865
We are aware that some of them are already undergoing processes of democratic stabilisation, that others still need to affirm the democratic authority of their governments, and that equilibrium in others depends on the military presence in the zone, but they are all countries which now know that, once they have overcome their difficulties, a bridge is available to provide an effective link with the European Union.	0.9185507418893588
Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow Members.	0.7509772715106702
I think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy.	0.9631283301066353
Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example.	0.47400030140622407
We know there are 13 applicant countries, from Lithuania to Turkey, and just one black hole in Europe, the Balkans, but because these countries are denied the opportunity to become applicants, we want to make them believe that this agreement is a miracle.	1.0333254059039374
Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status.	0.2992439924072392
But this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, if negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years.	1.1045344417804082
And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia, amongst the Balkan countries, three years hence.	0.6871908731732594
A few days ago Mr Racan announced that Croatia' s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000.	0.508728104560324
There are bound to be other applications and this great work, this fine intellectual architecture, will crumble, left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former Yugoslavia for the past 20 years.	0.8257919795340534
This would not be so serious if this region of Europe were not so beset by the problems we are all aware of, problems which are being addressed, but which have not yet been resolved, by the new government of Macedonia. There are the problems of coexistence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, the connected problems of Kosovo, the notorious economic problems, the problems of being neighbour to a particularly developed mafia in Serbia, and then there is the problem of the Greek veto which must be condemned for what it is.	1.058504029200854
After nearly 10 years, Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name, and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia.	0.8551368940482466
It is absolutely absurd. Apart from anything else it is offensive, in my opinion, to the Greek MEPs and the citizens of Greece.	0.8606507998889209
This question needs to be resolved urgently.	0.6847291469659518
Finally, by happy chance, a letter from Mr Georgievski, President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler, dated 8 March, has come into my hands. In it, referring to Article O, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union.	0.8318137456257868
Why has the Council not informed us of this?	0.5577048565620718
Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia?	0.5985234768197565
Mr President, Commissioner, the Balkans are not purely a dark cave, politically speaking.	0.7171363258694095
The decidedly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves.	0.6072861643832751
The gruesome escalation of ethnic violence in neighbouring Kosovo did not reach its territory.	0.3764996766732205
Paradoxically, but truly, the war in Kosovo Polje generated exactly the opposite effect: the perilous gap of confidence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority became decidedly smaller.	0.6828410036493181
From the point of view of the Macedonian majority, the Albanian minority behaved loyally towards the common state during the international explosion of the Kosovo conflict.	0.6779777569216411
In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo' s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme.	0.5323935990934127
This remarkable upshot of the Kosovar war negotiations can therefore justifiably be seen as the internal, political establishment of the Republic of Macedonia the second time round.	0.6579015261040574
Mr Swoboda' s well-balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level.	0.47307380945251026
In brief, the European Union knows what to do in Macedonia: to help this local port of refuge - recently used by scores of war refugees - to fulfil its role properly as a catalyst for the planned Stability Pact in the Balkans.	0.7965587487531326
Mr President, as one who has been concerned with Macedonia for eight years, I have to contradict Mr Dupuis.	1.0035882475696567
What we are doing here is not hypocritical.	0.6793748090628888
We have reached a propitious moment and I think the Macedonians are glad about it.	0.7515959943319922
Please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything.	0.2543509268878565
I think we should take a more positive approach here.	0.8326753153889128
Macedonia did not go through a war.	0.4293844460868878
But it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions, as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries.	0.8504214292393201
It suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war.	0.3610392813003966
So we must admit that developments in Macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines.	0.3716572289466003
This is a country that has difficult inter-ethnic problems to deal with at home, and is resolving them with increasing success.	0.8780859870820135
Let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30% of ethnic Albanians in government activity, in government policy and in society, is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia.	0.8616861289419555
I am glad to see that the hope Mr Swoboda expressed in his report will be fulfilled early in March, i.e. that we will finally have an EU delegation there and that we, as the European Union, will finally have a greater role to play there.	0.9882477572356753
I believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country.	0.8987518646312181
As a sign of our political commitment, we must finally show Macedonia in practice that we are indeed rewarding its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embarking on regional projects.	0.6813443827448823
Let me name just two small ones: the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier crossing with Kosovo in Blace and the creation of Corridor 8, from Albania via Macedonia to Bulgaria.	0.6375180587275048
I think Mr Swoboda has drafted an excellent report, and it has my wholehearted support.	0.8663620005922643
Mr President, I too would like to compliment Mr Swoboda on his report.	0.7067735135383417
I think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it.	0.936380131485004
The report tackles stability in the region in a structural manner. This is also the purpose of the pending agreement with the Republic of Macedonia which we are debating today.	0.9514693692017996
Although the actual implementation of the Stability Pact has not yet started, the Commission has already developed the new instrument, entitled the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.	0.8494842942602207
This marks the beginning of the treaty-based stabilising process for the countries of the former Yugoslavia.	0.9107749915547576
These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement.	0.5148203956157238
The present agreement is a kind of pre-pre-agreement, but with a view to joining in future.	0.749447824752484
The instrument of joining countries together by means of active treaties is excellent, provided that the agreements stipulated in them are implemented dynamically, so that the required stabilisation can actually be attained.	0.6097320688180101
Macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match.	0.43167616870469466
It does, however, have the ambition to break free from this image.	0.6254750379374607
This requires internal stability.	0.18362157534727033
The new government would like to tackle this matter and the agreement could be an agenda for reforms, including a direct role and equality for the Albanian minority.	0.8596007268041669
More than anything, the country needs peace and quiet now, in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to greater prosperity.	0.8995824740635212
We, the social democrats, would urge the opposition to back these ideas.	0.9195627974606314
They need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model.	0.44868696826361165
But the country also - and especially - needs external stability.	0.8342968179972107
What is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable?	0.6381576294459731
This stability is required in the relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria.	0.6786714338944003
The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist.	0.7188066261453143
External stability also means open borders and regional cooperation.	0.40399689480773765
Minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange.	0.6710230755071612
Macedonia' s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries.	0.6937785602642573
The Kosovo problem is well-known and the international community is present there on a massive scale.	0.7741298573406472
It seems that the Albania factor is being underestimated.	0.48628466890193034
The Union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country.	0.6450839857867092
But what then instead?	0.1881222755902435
It is the very argument to conclude an agreement with Macedonia and not yet with Albania that cause us so much concern, so much so that a passive stance from the Union vis-à-vis Albania is really not acceptable.	0.721648312963128
What does the Commission intend to do regarding this issue?	0.5137654855863172
Yugoslavia is just as much a weak link in the stability process and, as such, a threat to Macedonia' s stability.	0.8169300280211688
We need to wait and see what happens there.	0.7354607512004151
The mood in Belgrade is becoming less predictable by the day.	0.3412164537001097
We, however, second the Council' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus.	0.7132184970313663
In this way, at least a serious attempt is being made to give the opposition, which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations, a shot in the arm.	0.9677125947917714
What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met?	0.7947914406834463
What else can we do to support this opposition?	0.6975557122791046
Mr President, Commissioner, Kosovo was hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpreted as saying that dictators could persecute minorities in the most repellent way on the grounds that "it is happening within their own nation" .	0.6488135026217497
When the USA and NATO and, finally, also the EU, reacted, it was already late, in fact very late.	0.9730225797717775
A great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the EU, among others, has acted earlier and more decisively.	0.7031373485293273
We, the European Union, therefore have a special responsibility to help, support and rebuild the Balkans now.	0.9612441685643041
Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU - economically, politically and in terms of trade.	0.820272031275827
Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration.	0.5662691878157775
We Liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly, just as Paolo Costa reported.	0.7603048628561422
It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report.	1.0768063017007017
Macedonia deserves our support, especially in view of the self-sacrificial, disinterested work which the people and leaders of Macedonia undertook during the Kosovo war.	0.6430064216645979
Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms.	0.556974310447146
We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans.	0.9233259728202287
This is an urgent duty for the EU.	0.8338316017844495
Mr President, allow me in this context to remind MEPs - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war, human degradation, murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia.	0.8298345051282418
The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free.	0.5066394666152101
I am talking about Milosevic.	0.22604482526434952
As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path, Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans, including in Macedonia.	0.658175911812556
Mr President, the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe,	0.9408874035244349
Its terms, which the Swoboda report accepts, are certainly not directed towards peace, but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country, and towards controlling its natural wealth, overexploiting its workforce and continuing to use that country as a springboard against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order.	0.8377855672813628
All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union.	0.6991409051842091
The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe.	0.8077353049420724
It is characteristic that the report congratulates FYROM on the constructive stance it maintained during the NATO attack, eulogises its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for NATO forces, but, of course, remains silent about the indignation of its people, which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the NATO bombardments.	0.675285607282109
Finally, because we consider that both the stability pact and the stabilisation and association process the European Union is implementing in countries in that area, will create new problems there, new tribulations for their peoples, and will reinforce the dominant role of the American and European imperialists, we will be voting against the report in an expression of our solidarity with the people of FYROM.	1.0413429958779885
Mr President, Commissioner, one of the most basic aims of the European Union' s stability and association agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area, and this, of course, presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved.	0.907507441198997
I shall not bother you with details of the problem concerning the name FYROM, which as you must know, is the subject of a difference of opinion with Greece and of negotiations between the two countries lasting over four years, under the aegis of the Secretary General of the UN in the context of related Security Council resolutions, but also the conventional obligation of the respective parties pursuant to Article 5 of the so-termed Intermediate Agreement of 1995.	0.8859055066655847
I do, however, think it appropriate to say that, at the forthcoming negotiations and with the conclusion of the association agreement, the European side must point out to the Skopje government the need for it to show appropriate constructive political will, so that it may contribute positively to a successful outcome of the talks in New York.	0.933477833663051
I should like to hope that such an appeal from Europe, with parallel emphasis on the difficulties that any further indecision would create for completing and implementing the association agreement, would be duly heeded and appraised accordingly by the Skopje government, so that it can respond appropriately, on the one hand, to Greece' s demonstrably conciliatory attitude concerning the specific issue, and, on the other hand, to the more general practical, declared intention and disposition of all the partners in the European Union, including Greece, to facilitate and support FYROM' s progress towards a United Europe.	0.8357653930315599
Mr President, this is because I do not think that the harmonious day to day relations, contacts and communication between FYROM and Greece that have actually been achieved at both bipartite and multipartite level, and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement, I repeat, I do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good neighbourliness necessary, inter alia, for negotiating and concluding an association agreement.	0.7775190118419546
On the contrary, I think that this demand can only be considered satisfied by a de jure full normalisation of FYROM' s relations with all its neighbours.	0.7174720425631185
That, combined with the essential improvement of certain aspects of the internal situation in that country, in the area of minorities and democratic institutions, would round off the image of political maturity which FYROM has, in fact, presented in other respects and which has made our European family welcome closer relations with it.	0.832249379392939
Mr President, the agreement we are debating today, as analysed by Mr Swoboda, which I hope we will adopt tomorrow, constitutes the second politically positive step, after the stability pact for the area.	1.1001510717430982
There is another small step, which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for Yugoslavia.	0.6765322918890887
For about 10 years, the situation in the area has been fluid.	1.0407330244905624
Both as an historical period and, in particular, as a political period, 10 years is a very long time.	1.0217647359961028
Under those conditions, then, there has been a real failure.	0.831005096164649
In that sense, the agreement we will be voting on tomorrow, which contributes towards stability in the area, is de facto a move in the right direction.	0.9669874034162854
In essence, FYROM is a miniature version of the former Yugoslavia, regardless of where one or another minority holds supremacy.	0.51902737449892
From that standpoint, the fact that so far it has resisted any influences from its wider environment is a very positive element and under no circumstances should any of us, any State, any policy or any view, impel that small republic towards external, disruptive movements in an effort to solve other problems, granted - let it be noted - that it has institutions which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy.	0.7682366899437325
In that area, there have been various policies from time to time, and what the European Union should guard against is the risk that, for ultimately superficial reasons, it may help to create banana republics elsewhere.	1.0723722506741953
We must be sure that, in seeking allies in the area, we must not always choose anyone who offers.	1.109349665668257
We must choose those which are moderate, which have breadth of vision and which have a perception of peace and stability in the area.	0.9030278401746588
I hope and wish, and am indeed certain, that the European Union, with maturity and with the measures it has begun to adopt, will little by little construct, in the wider area, the necessary environment which it needs itself.	0.9620835030998698
Let us not deceive ourselves: a Europe, one part of which is being held back because of frictions, misinterpretations and conflicts, and because of nationalistic clashes, will never be a Europe that has brought its own house to the level it wants.	1.012731559004585
In any event, speaking now as a Greek, I want to tell some of the speakers I listened to earlier that much of what was said is fixated on other times and places.	0.686588375249219
They have quite failed to grasp the new conditions created in the area; the new and positive conditions which have been created, in very many cases on Greece' s initiative.	0.9864895614630229
You should know that the country which cooperates most with FYROM and has the best relations with it, in the entire area, is Greece, and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area.	0.9126749150684297
I say this just so that we know where we stand.	0.914253879147996
. This has been a very interesting general debate about the Balkans as a whole.	1.0634837901070495
It was none the worse for that, but perhaps I will be forgiven for concentrating very largely on the report because there are some extremely important issues that I want to touch on.	0.8529049748902228
I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission's position on the report.	0.9872236031039391
It is very helpful.	0.7456753712963364
It is an excellent contribution by Mr Swoboda and his colleagues.	0.9633764524022861
We are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues, a number of whom are in the House this evening - Mrs Pack, Mr Lagendijk and others.	0.9285613618449515
I am very pleased that at our overall relations with FYROM are in such a good state.	0.701511061234748
Perhaps Mr Dupuis will forgive me for using that expression - both he and his interpreter - in the spirit of entente cordiale.	0.6656356340123809
That has been helped by our excellent European Union representative in the country.	0.5805691744993275
He has been a great friend to Parliament and a great servant of the Commission.	0.9497132370463961
The imminent commencement of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement is the most powerful example of our good relations.	0.6524959533411547
So to is the cooperation of FYROM in the rebuilding of Kosovo.	0.5420468414141748
I am grateful to the authorities in Macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in Kosovo.	0.6853784715360086
Like honourable Members I recognise the stabilising role that this country has played during the Balkan tragedy, in particular when it comes to integrating the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country.	0.8366080417403929
I saw the newly-elected President Georgievski a few weeks ago and I was extremely impressed, as others have been, by his commitment to multi-ethnicity and pluralism.	0.7314310852895376
Let me set out where matters now stand on these negotiations to which - as Mr Lagendijk said - other countries in the region are looking with very considerable interest.	0.7802969007134031
The Council adopted on 24 January this year its negotiating directives for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	0.4162644879962809
This represents the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process of the western Balkans region initiated by the Commission in May 1999.	0.9568907020176879
Let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives.	0.5035814647288285
They cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with FYROM.	0.5193626810925184
They cover provisions for enhanced regional cooperation including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region, though I must make it clear that there is no question of any attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia.	0.7447446035794805
They cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the European Union and them within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement.	0.7327057050081467
They cover provisions on the movement of workers, freedom of establishment, supply of services, current payments and movement of capital.	0.6083668022306965
They cover a commitment by FYROM to approximate its legislation to that of the European Community, notably in key areas of the internal market; and they cover provisions on cooperation with FYROM in a wide range of fields, including justice and home affairs.	0.8350304276284055
We are now making in the Commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in March.	0.9074072450273363
I am due to visit FYROM in the second week in March.	0.5388474226686002
I hope to be able to set the process in motion then, although the formal negotiations will start very shortly thereafter.	0.7284416384039955
At the time of that visit I will also, as recommended by honourable Members and others, be upgrading our representation in FYROM.	0.8178450972178509
The target date for concluding the negotiations is December this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators.	0.5519920829976366
The agreement could enter into force in three to four years from now, given the time needed for ratification in Member States' parliaments.	0.726124962723204
I should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution.	0.7544025442720036
We accept that the agreement should to a certain extent serve as an example for other such agreements, although obviously we will also want to take account of the fact that we are dealing with different countries, each of which has its own identity and its own concerns.	0.8998288803546245
I share the wide-spread concern that we should treat each country on its merits and not shackle everyone to the pace of the slowest in the development of relations with the Union.	0.64009551903791
That has never been the intention.	0.5150314270076157
The very fact that negotiations are beginning first with FYROM, before all the others, is evidence that we can and do differentiate.	0.8596187377718827
On the provision of regional aid referred to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to projects having a cross-border or regional dimension.	0.7211788510670868
We agree that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of EU membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement.	0.5609025943670511
It will reflect the European Union's position on its relations with the countries of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusions.	0.7959782339823386
We strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent.	0.5097311382725179
As for the arrangements covering European Union assistance to the western Balkans, Members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and streamline their management and to put everything under one regulation.	0.8294458649100982
I am aware that there is concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and, especially, at the loss of association with the PHARE name.	0.8288671245430929
I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score.	0.39062860826033713
I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion.	0.726056650617295
I want to stress, however, that whatever the programme is called, our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbours into the European family is stronger than ever.	0.8726271624051549
In general I trust that Members of this House will share my pleasure that Macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly.	0.6277762763116321
I hope that the other countries of the region will redouble their efforts to make similar progress.	0.909532071324332
I look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking, I hope, the success of what we are trying to do in the Balkans which, for me, remains the single most important litmus-test of what Europe is able to do on its own doorstep.	0.9078205852102157
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	0.5834953176753255
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	0.21763534501096538
Agreement on comitology	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the implementation of the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 on comitology (1999/468/EC).	0.7140745036134678
. (IT) Mr President, the approval of this agreement with the Commission on procedures for implementing the Council decision on comitology marks the end of a saga which has kept Parliament busy for two years, along with a few enthusiasts scattered among the various institutions of the Union, whom many people do not hesitate to call masochists.	0.8404141341674524
Until 1993, the way the Commission exercised its executive powers, and in particular the mysterious and even suspect committee arrangements, was creating conflict and mistrust between the institutions, and threatening to have serious consequences on the legislative procedure.	0.8695636195472783
That is why, in accordance with Declaration No 31, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union institutions have undertaken a complex task of negotiation and consultation, resulting in the new Council decision, which revises the old system quite substantially, although we are not entirely satisfied with it.	0.8628316732825694
In particular, the decision outlines a form of parliamentary control whereby Parliament can sound the alarm if an implementing measure, deriving from an act adopted under the codecision procedure, oversteps the implementing powers delegated to the Commission.	0.5904139668113713
During the protracted interinstitutional negotiations - which saw Parliament actively involved, thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Adelaide Aglietta - it was understood that the European Parliament and Commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedures for implementing certain aspects of the new decision. On the one hand, certain points which the Council did not intend to incorporate into the decision were to be made explicit and, on the other, the system for providing information about implementing measures and monitoring them was to be organised more precisely.	0.9209915894269782
During the trialogue held on 6 October 1999 in Strasbourg, the Presidents of the European Parliament and the Commission approved the idea of concluding this agreement soon.	0.8315924532406593
We believe we have respected that commitment, and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the Commission.	0.77237361059961
Essentially, the agreement deals with two points: one is the right of the European Parliament to be informed, which is the sine qua non for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to Article 8 of the decision.	0.9904285380901654
Hitherto, such information had been supplied on paper and unsystematically, and was of no use to our services; and indeed this was often the fault of Parliament itself.	0.7988086237632133
From now on, the information will be provided by means of an electronic system called CIRCA, to which the European Parliament will have access. This represents a real innovation, not only for us, but also - I am sure - for the Commission.	1.2093968454795663
The other point is that Article 8 of the Council decision does not specify either the method by which the European Parliament is to sound the alarm, or the time limit within which it must exercise its restricted power of control.	0.8929135109473024
Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement confirm that, as a general rule, the European Parliament will adopt its resolution, stating its reasons, at a plenary sitting and has one month to exercise its right of intervention before the Commission adopts the draft implementing measure.	0.8499257537038649
But we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure.	0.8238944760963746
Therefore, the agreement contains explicit provisions on urgent procedure, including possible action by the committee responsible.	0.9744360655728334
I want to end by stressing that we cannot assess whether this is a good agreement or not, we must wait and see how it works in practice.	0.9745579523471797
The European Parliament needs to acquire the resources, which it currently lacks, to ensure efficient monitoring of implementing measures, and the Commission must accept that some of its practices need reorganising to provide proper information to Parliament and ensure that control can be effective.	1.026395386983162
Finally, it needs to be borne in mind that - whatever happens - the real solution to the problems of comitology for the European Parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the Treaties, and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an anomaly that severely restricts the Commission' s executive power and may prejudice the European Parliament' s legislative powers.	0.8886176328144827
Mr President, comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means.	0.7033745917668813
It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies, which is the way things used to be.	0.8134837822617639
In fact, it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission.	0.6846447600301508
The procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures.	0.5225879809657751
Up until the Amsterdam Treaty, there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures, which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens.	0.7726646480359713
On the contrary, for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed.	1.1263495753053625
For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees.	1.0924824579102976
Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors.	0.49424625617288853
A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases.	0.9036133804840929
It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny.	0.38794217859204444
With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced - as the European Parliament had long wanted - to three procedures, the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure.	0.927957014522838
Now, following the Amsterdam Treaty, the rights of information and control granted to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement.	1.0424439393118163
Mrs Frassoni, our rapporteur, has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within Parliament.	0.8967287159682823
A key problem is the time factor.	0.6559002887308896
When the European Parliament is informed, it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks, should it so wish.	0.958376316057349
In matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be in a position to react very rapidly, if necessary within a few hours or days.	1.1018426773362515
Nevertheless, the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react.	0.981962271783717
Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties, which I and my group can only support in full.	0.7785204040275283
I just have one more request.	0.5039440979169154
In the German version, paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather misleadingly and I urgently ask for clarification, which I would also like to see in the printed version later.	0.8652286251449292
In my view, instead of "weitergeführt werden müssen" the wording should be "erhalten bleiben müssen" .	0.4595978083101388
The German version is not very clear here.	0.6553601675379168
I would ask for that to be checked again.	0.7350370701268589
For the rest, I warmly thank our rapporteur.	0.8025454669358147
It is a difficult subject and I hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now.	1.0091900826248432
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report.	0.9494852922933571
I must add that it is a welcome change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions.	0.7733736571417303
When it comes to the IGC, she is one of what the French call "les pures et dures" : no compromise, no deals with the other institutions; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions.	0.8347804097831516
Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament' s original position on the issue of comitology.	0.799979901443566
Let us remember what is at stake here.	0.6198353483755514
Parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new Council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement.	0.5609673604579709
Firstly, the whole system is obscure.	1.0794595173116628
It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees.	0.614583410843766
Here is a real step forward, in the new system that has been agreed.	1.1589583660750384
We are to know who is on each committee.	0.8626688767197525
We are to know when they meet.	0.7295585488921259
We are to get the agendas.	0.90013776098153
We are to get the documents that are sent to them.	0.8155118502992487
The whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex.	0.8439551400935772
So that is at least a step forward.	0.8780167824099149
Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission.	0.6199543159368839
We adopt legislation in the European Union.	0.5215654730002631
We expect the Commission to implement it.	0.6951972762026
And then we have a system designed to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the "contre-filet" system, under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned.	0.8623097480291315
Here too there is at least some progress.	0.586682813503787
The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States represented in the Council.	0.7489659624585454
That is a more reasonable system.	0.7741877549833562
That, too, is a step forward.	1.0069992847712739
But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied.	0.7114819016069203
The first criticism is of the system whereby the Commission is monitored, scrutinised, controlled if you like, only by a committee appointed by Member States or the Council not by Parliament.	0.894940975408054
The legislative authority, Council and Parliament, should be equal.	0.698135503487495
We confer implementing powers on the Commission, but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure.	0.8940944489567204
Parliament has no equivalent power.	0.37783228067511887
True, we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system.	1.066799945689748
We are to receive all the draft implementing measures forwarded to a committee at the same time as it is sent to the committee.	0.9630399006995567
We will have the chance to scrutinise, to debate, to question.	1.0583338170967316
But we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the Commission in the legislation.	1.0104764430328463
In other words, we can challenge the measure for being ultra-vires but not on its content.	0.6735622228561523
And in a democracy, Parliament should be able to challenge the content.	0.8902352668512811
Not that we do so every week.	0.8000153943587389
We are not seeking to immerse ourselves in implementing decisions, but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary.	1.001551708153666
That is lacking in this new system, or at least is only there in embryonic form.	0.7286502117985403
Finally, our fourth criticism is that if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system it is referred back, not to both branches of the legislative authority, but to the Council alone, which has the right possibly to take an alternative measure.	1.0047410396998464
That is not correct.	0.8050847853513641
Both branches adopt the legislation - Council and Parliament - that confers implementing powers on the Commission.	0.7497915177815553
If such implementing measures are referred back, it should be to both branches, not to one branch alone.	0.923120308004851
Overall we have a system which has made some progress.	0.9864076427194185
The supplementary aspects that arise from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but that could not change the basic decision of the Council.	0.969227381052238
Even here, we have renounced voluntarily - because this did not happen automatically - the Plumb-Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise.	0.9501566125164889
We have been willing to relinquish the provisions in that.	0.5498018886005078
We shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision.	0.9742648895130623
We must be very vigilant.	0.9404138745575622
So it is a step forward.	0.8622570396123493
My group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward.	0.5634718196341547
We are not as enthusiastic about compromising as Mrs Frassoni.	0.5559220732313839
We recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years' time.	0.8298847450075564
If we want a Union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject.	0.6757199370765917
Mr President, first I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, for her work.	1.0186280961947258
It is never easy working on comitology.	0.2963128774243176
Mrs Schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic, something we have long talked about.	0.6363755567999544
Certainly the process has always been very complex, as a result of historical decisions, and these must eventually be rationalised.	0.8911876981345376
In my opinion, the agreement reached between Commission and Parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process.	1.00930634050733
From our point of view, it satisfies the fundamental interests of Parliament.	0.6592806295166732
Mr Corbett set out Parliament' s concerns.	0.33438054488780594
He says some of them have been satisfied and others have not.	0.8192493203142496
I would say the ones the Commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied.	0.8355833704106962
Mr Corbett is raising issues the Council decision does not cover, and unfortunately we can go no further on those.	0.7554330971428194
So how far have we come?	0.30539746076562324
There is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point, highlighted by Mrs Frassoni, given that we now have an automatic information system.	0.8676060611110057
This will facilitate two activities Parliament is especially interested in.	0.396320067951096
One is knowing how the committees operate, about their composition, agendas, descriptions, and so on, and the other is the right of scrutiny over actual decisions.	0.8877419725334692
I think this is a good agreement.	1.0641807514820842
It is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process.	0.781477063207066
From here on things are going to be easier.	0.5978798856349334
But the agreement we are reaching today should not be regarded as a backward step compared with the Plumb/Delors Agreement.	0.5561281260218023
Mr Corbett referred to that, but the new model is certainly much more complex, different because the situation is now different, and, in our opinion, much more coherent.	0.9495005854314329
We have made a start, and we hope the work will produce some excellent results.	1.0456063087190077
We think there are other positive advances too.	0.5505669897857628
To a certain extent we have gone beyond agreements which are already dated and, by realigning old procedures with the new situation, we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past.	0.8303615663273455
From the Commission' s point of view, our conclusion is that this is a good agreement, and we want to thank the Members of Parliament who worked on it - especially Mrs Frassoni.	1.1442644778459026
We hope that this new climate means we have achieved the result we were seeking, which is greater transparency and better information about the decisions of the Commission as an executive.	0.9439956471856767
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	0.5686715436479425
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	0.21763534501096538
Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure	0.09651735860535661
The next item is the report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS))	0.49156877575691327
Mr President, I am also pleased to welcome the Spanish Commissioner, Mr Solbes Mira, whom I have congratulated more than once, inside and outside this Parliament, on the excellent work he did in Spain on the subject of European convergence.	0.8461546711997125
The proposal for an amendment to this regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure, annexed to the Treaty of Maastricht, raises fundamental issues concerning the switch to the 1995 European system of accounts, which, as you know, replaced the previous System of Accounts adopted in 1979, and in particular the emergence of new financial product categories, consistency in the calculation of the ratios of government deficit to gross domestic product on the basis of ESA 95 and, finally, recognising the importance of calculating interest expenditure and the consistency of the latter with this new methodology.	0.7137661955722658
In our view, the main purpose of the proposal for a regulation is to update the definitions and the assessments of some of the economic operations involved in the calculation of deficits, as reflected in the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Treaty of Maastricht, which lays down the maximum percentages which the government deficit must not exceed as a ratio of GDP at market prices in the various Member States.	0.8631504696513247
To date, the Member States have calculated this GDP in accordance with the criteria laid down in ESA 79.	0.7051403164037443
The most recent estimate of the deficit was submitted in September 1999 and it relates to the 1998 financial year.	0.6030629721772779
Therefore, if the regulation is adopted, the estimate which is due to appear in March 2000, the first estimate of the deficit for the 1999 accounting year, will be made using the new system.	0.9223806439682096
We know the Member States have done their duty - if I can use that expression - doing their calculations and preparing their national accounts in line with ESA 95, and they have already published their corresponding estimates.	0.8835015193364162
In addition to incorporating a new methodology, this has meant making slight changes to most accounting aggregates and operations, on account of the aforesaid methodological changes, and also the improved statistical information included in the estimates.	0.8353381791381649
These changes may of course alter the government deficits in terms of the Member States' national accounting.	0.6653147238620111
I will now describe, very briefly, the five areas where the most important changes may occur.	0.9317943551194622
First, the adjustments to the scope of what is meant by 'government institutional sector' under ESA 95.	0.6657476187988745
This is important, since government deficit means the deficit accumulated by all forms of government.	0.674072374442391
The non-availability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the Member States' government deficits.	0.6637705330461665
Secondly, the deficit - or, if applicable, the surplus - means the ESA 95 government sector' s net borrowing requirement or lending ability respectively	0.799734071733662
Thirdly, government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector, as defined in ESA 95.	0.7890212607040844
Fourthly, government debt is defined in accordance with ESA 95, as are the flows or interest stemming from assets/liabilities.	0.6186001402856136
Fifthly and finally, the aggregate to which government debt will relate will be gross domestic product at current market prices, estimated in accordance with the 1995 European System of Accounts' definitions.	0.5372055086733821
To summarise, I consider that this proposal constitutes a satisfactory adaptation of the criteria laid down in the 1995 European System of Accounts, and I therefore approve it in full, as did the committee.	0.9626138191970909
Mr President, Commissioner, let me say at the outset that my group welcomes this proposal because it makes the basic statistical data for an economic and monetary union directed at stability and real growth more harmonised, directly comparable and more accurate.	0.7298073863646595
We have already heard about the various aspects involved.	0.7989799100041812
What I think is crucial is that henceforth the statistical data will be more reliable and comparable.	0.6161863977860437
	-0.0
