The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods. Just as the Sea Empress, just as the Braer did.	0.6422146787140017
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster.	0.7178043027641605
My group's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster, just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions.	0.7007545662760599
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea.	0.5831615883242923
The time for resolutions has passed.	0.5034337922574719
What is now needed is action.	0.4015846704724814
Sadly, I fear, the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster.	1.14577911722663
Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again.	0.8370033381688715
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future.	0.6669666686057862
The "Erika" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected, but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe.	0.7473555466903059
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe.	0.7009472586596976
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds, perhaps mainly guillemots, may have died.	0.6396180342548704
The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic.	0.4922164025630813
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying.	0.6147349456466207
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the "polluter pays" principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced.	0.6171449139641724
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks, but the question is, how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes?	1.0319141024025293
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice.	0.8625895504818676
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully.	0.5392807616537584
Mr President, Commissioner, I have brought you a small gift. Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows: "With every tide, the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika.	0.6839132689103992
With every tide, the volunteers, members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick, sticky, black tar.	0.5194949592485905
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?"	0.609227982517554
Indeed this disaster involving the Erika, like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey, moreover, is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available.	0.7267202672412694
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, despite our saying at the time and many times since, "Never again!"	0.7831073371632795
It is, of course, the responsibility of policies, and therefore our responsibility, to guarantee the safety of sea transport.	0.9578802809040852
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again.	0.6058097507128355
But, listening to you, Commissioner, we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992, I believe, the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee.	0.8862978819308107
Indeed, we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many.	0.8463378597914469
This is why it is essential, as a matter of urgency, for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes.	0.880651492325092
We should be aware, for example, that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil.	0.7541891687168498
Why, in these circumstances, is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised?	0.9449279841957446
Your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance, at last, of the ban on degassing at sea.	0.6933966832878931
A European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently.	0.46519587854815175
In addition, it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO, as a matter of urgency.	1.0872385172818964
What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if, once they are at sea, most vessels do just what they wish?	0.6793942374546644
Finally, a compassionate thought for all the volunteers, nature lovers and bird lovers, who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds, organising rescue operation with the means available.	0.6739447147887642
I can testify to this remarkable work.	0.25422193188938497
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick, which is a major ecological disaster, practically unprecedented in scale.	0.7447706582463325
In relation to this, you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces.	0.65813104747229
And, on this subject, Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats.	0.9872003197122241
Once again, there will be no clearly defined party responsible.	0.6982821159457562
In the meantime, it is nature that is taking the rap, as always.	0.7236911244613665
Mr President, my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster, affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment.	0.7895752203816709
Let me, in this connection, welcome the presence in the visitors' gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque, spokesperson for the oil slick action group "Marée noire" , made up of men and women from the French department of Morbihan.	0.663599164780313
Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field.	0.8116365857633879
As the European Parliament, we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and, at the same time, demanding tightening up of the quality criteria, on the European and international scale, of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport, stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders.	0.8951278415823066
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers.	0.6411771831509523
Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year, 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more.	0.6313172204331273
This is no longer tolerable.	0.5581602621650379
Next, we have flags of convenience.	0.8392096574961243
According to the International Transport Federation, over 40% of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience, the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety.	0.7224744490193324
This is no longer tolerable.	0.5581602621650379
Finally, there is the lack of transparency.	0.9103775688875968
Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility, the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible.	0.7196593459500569
This is no longer tolerable.	0.5581602621650379
In all these respects we must ensure real, significant change, including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards, including the mandatory double hull, on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States.	0.7825949023045604
We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels.	0.5271341258315864
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused.	0.712944905703658
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance.	0.7676781915967616
This is an approach, Mr President, which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation.	1.1323220123381799
In so doing, it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which, in this instance, is awaiting clear, tangible action.	1.0041771991845028
Mr President, Commissioner, as a Member for the French Atlantic coast, for Vendée, I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters, caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us, but by a crime.	0.9732927595075866
In this emergency, in this ordeal, we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity, national solidarity, and intergovernmental solidarity.	0.9797683704785417
What the stricken populations are waiting for now, those who have lost everything, particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism, those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come, is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused, but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future.	0.7572691773589223
Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.	0.8051194475835142
Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals.	0.7120118887579842
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies.	0.5038429946893275
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion.	0.6548043981212809
Obviously, such matters should be handled at world level, but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose, and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter, despite previous disasters.	0.8384234475999738
Admittedly, there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, IOPCF, but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level, which must be reviewed.	0.838373371355676
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO.	0.5768776794526649
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this.	1.0630668740964369
Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience, that of a state applying for membership of the European Union.	0.7767685348803562
In addition, there are Community directives, but they are seldom applied, if at all, due to the insufficient number of national inspectors.	0.8089546999621898
This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency.	0.4471711311575147
A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but it is making very slow progress.	0.7921011356452187
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings.	0.5745319086747771
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July.	0.8990376612757461
This must be brought forward.	0.7659591785458325
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict.	0.5939821737482103
I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities.	0.43091073316907685
Firstly, the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally.	0.6140523401733458
The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil, criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select.	0.7612718496637705
Secondly, the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely.	0.7064451328108177
Thirdly, a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future.	0.7921904016593307
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age.	0.5837298421984877
If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear, strict and trenchant, then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory, in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters.	0.7817896020866344
Thus, the Erika was refused access to American waters.	0.739534530063435
If the European Community had done the same, a great disaster would have been avoided.	1.0414405047730924
Let us ensure, Mr President, Commissioner, that this time we really do learn the lesson, even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down.	0.8583497545256141
Mr President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic Bravery, Haven, Amoco Cadiz, Gino, Tanio, so many names we remember with horror.	0.47617220697876456
And now the Erika.	0.2609175324279436
Whose turn is next?	0.11380101628335686
Twenty one years after Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth oil slick, the seventh since 1967, shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers.	0.6256521211516156
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react, for their capitulation to the multinationals.	0.6032848512343141
It is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept, and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety.	0.7601161585918855
And this is the result.	1.2023421936550294
The Erika, a vessel flying a Maltese flag, a floating rust bucket, classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers, has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline, a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz.	0.6751848862721743
As an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region, unfortunately, I can testify to this.	0.7089359508378493
There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters, they are the result of fate.	0.778014280662606
They are the result of human thoughtlessness.	0.6810591929509628
What we have here is an ecological disaster.	0.9944849559007706
Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that.	0.47763347107170473
It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, people who make a living from the salt marshes, shopkeepers, etc.	0.7270261913223441
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series.	0.7748558592240595
First of all, we must shed some light on this shipwreck.	0.7094873610002893
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission?	0.8012179638524095
Next, as a matter of urgency, we muss pass legislation, firstly, regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported.	0.8061718181973042
In fact, according to the experts, the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast.	0.6475876621005938
We know what actually happened.	0.46694480522782505
Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old.	0.5065075405694991
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea.	0.5399166511488622
This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium.	0.9678298091830746
Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the "polluter pays" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate "natural disasters" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds.	0.6815998412829838
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group.	0.8006377580574155
Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning.	0.7289413979707796
It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time.	0.8008532339638701
We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice.	0.7038373523922642
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things.	0.7687386235770499
No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances.	0.7730727784877856
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation.	0.8565942448084561
However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that.	0.8956233919704264
In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system.	0.7202226199159281
Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response.	0.8773160372965275
Many thanks for this.	0.21774265945919194
This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today.	0.8123694728137806
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best.	0.6193978963558795
The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money.	0.6704972299022698
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members.	0.49034826828389844
During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more.	0.8858245955950741
What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision.	0.7434161154964671
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner?	0.8054997146441818
First of all, the port-state control, according to which 25% of all ships require inspection.	0.7250351240195062
I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place. So this 25% should be increased.	0.9831884380470332
Furthermore, if a ship is no longer seaworthy, not only should the facts be examined, but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used.	0.9658568061179889
But this is not in place.	1.067324572729891
Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area.	0.9581047587641845
Finally, as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned, some Members have already mentioned just now that, since 1999 in the United States, ships should in any case be double-hulled.	0.9102747129176438
In my opinion, we should look further into this point, and I also think that the Marpol Treaty, which comes into effect in 2001, should be looked at very closely.	1.0182906605367827
Mr President, I would like to take a brief, critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to, and admiration for, the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals.	0.8713726099831445
Mr President, we have already had this discussion so many times in the past.	1.0969976878349788
We have achieved nothing so far, and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union.	1.0117987758477303
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today, and what the Commissioner has announced here, actually leads to legislation being produced; in other words, if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers: "you must push this through in the Council of Ministers" .	0.9349339063122769
Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe, which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods.	0.853455757765488
So what are we to do now?	0.5395786752249649
I have no intention of talking about past events; rather I want to look to the future.	0.8012331966166577
What are we to do now?	0.52631296592995
I will tell you a few things we should do.	0.7698728987241293
Of course, we need double-hulled vessels.	0.9031917007187281
That goes without saying, but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term.	0.8780861224638028
So what do we need to happen immediately?	0.6986735997101609
We need technical testing of ships, that is obligatory technical testing every two years, and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate.	0.7471993626148571
We need this at European level and internationally; we need something like a TÜV, an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany, which is compulsory every two years.	0.7826419631109086
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle.	0.8220051075800872
This is what we need for ships.	0.8402719973161253
Thirdly, we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports, that is in every port of the European Union.	0.9102998956875273
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port, regardless of all the port charges.	0.5407952878689103
We must reach agreement here, in all the European Union' s ports, from Marseilles, through to Rotterdam, to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, and wherever ships drop anchor.	0.9485810431795926
Fourthly, we need the shipowner to bear liability, and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million, but to the value of at least USD 400 million, to be covered per insurance certificate.	1.0806360218349946
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability.	0.5736970273073213
We need to be sure that if need be, the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability.	0.6881412394926704
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision!	0.6830920952815045
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability.	0.47294350359147125
In the fifth place, we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union, and incidentally, that includes the candidate countries.	0.9726489865914731
Last but not least, we need a long memory, for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future.	0.918195232786336
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme.	0.6646747830214085
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports.	0.681027344788171
The unions will have something to say as will industry.	0.5539239590269545
A long memory will serve us well, ladies and gentlemen.	0.5964020350258605
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement.	0.7300897830147578
Just you go home and say: " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date" .	0.7706031714330481
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports.	0.9388456264671333
We need to have a long memory when we say: " for once we are united, at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned, and will not play one off against the other in the European Union."	1.0023772897874395
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years' time!	0.7328632929927463
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts.	0.7700210370461747
We have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures.	0.5948777509602585
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led?	0.721128912603001
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation' s introduction of the Plimsoll line, a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels.	0.5793237494361552
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had?	0.45964360916066954
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about, the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion.	0.6219000614099655
We must also critically examine the classification societies.	0.5900881704294239
I do not think that we can accept their procedures.	1.0531878966580612
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control.	0.3028754180646773
Finally, I want to say that, when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment, there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards.	0.8456032095817719
Within the Commission, the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.	1.177639163588558
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment, which are in keeping with the Commission' s guidelines, cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards.	0.9398810111953532
Mr President, we shall vote in favour of the GUE/NGL Group resolution because it denounces Total-Fina' s responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of superannuated vessels should be prohibited, or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil tankers.	0.7279597200523414
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick.	0.767079145913795
How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations, and indeed many others who, in order to make more profit, take the risk of making the world uninhabitable?	0.7813677244419795
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality, without governments reacting?	0.6586319337204771
The crux of the problem is that all governments, and indeed all the European institutions, acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment.	0.8318330747360396
They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks, even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions.	0.5896011716234635
In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage.	0.6664768336642924
Mr President, I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies.	0.6915008486410711
However, we must stick to the facts.	0.9324755319001341
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years.	0.6796280912683772
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken.	0.49142801298365485
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls.	1.0002479804080422
I cannot accept this.	0.4785773005999083
If the Member States decide, in agreement with ourselves, that 25% of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control, then they must also make the necessary personnel available.	0.9840053048237278
The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing, rather there must be materials testing, for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue.	0.7828602707814964
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous.	0.4601208695237902
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial, but include materials testing.	0.7500410448892291
Secondly, I also share the Commissioner' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path.	0.7976624895003287
If it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies.	0.5694116669808085
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit.	0.6836081988692554
Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we already have a TÜV (organisation for safety testing) for ships in the form of the classification companies.	0.7249445135137148
There are reputable companies too.	0.2117614139211265
You will be familiar with some reputable companies, our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable companies, but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements, and these must be struck off the list.	0.8127980027519229
Finally, we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements, for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up!	0.924399320423237
Mr President, Commissioner, the Erika sank near my home and is still there, with 20 000 tonnes in its hold, the fate of which we are waiting to discover.	0.909446517147237
It could have sunk anywhere.	0.3730817777889986
It happened to sink there, and Brittany, where I come from, should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula, and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks.	0.8988335674171241
My first thoughts are for the 26 Indian sailors, who were saved but of whom nothing has been said.	0.6595422375074041
There could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means, above all, men' s lives.	0.5743942394875653
By now they are far away.	0.39756658064989703
It is a miracle that they were saved.	0.8578262971595879
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast.	0.767842467094687
Things could well continue in the same way.	0.46961719832301124
Commissioner, as time is very short, I would like to pick out the seven points which we feel, and you have already mentioned some of them, are essential to work on: double-hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports. In particular, we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public, as currently, we do not have access to them.	0.9865974141224323
Then, sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States; they should not be different, but the same throughout the Union.	0.9234275643330753
We must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience, not because they are necessarily bad boats, but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones.	0.8602275258568753
We must improve information on all of the world' s ships, but provision has already been made for this. We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them.	0.9984455845720852
With regard to this matter, I would like to know who owns the Erika, because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing, but there are always real shareholders in the background. Where are the Erika' s owners?	0.8853983762275504
Perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches, getting a nice tan.	0.3640408941698628
We would like to know their names and their faces.	0.5900642479460241
Finally, there must be improvements in the training of crews.	0.8922989964771596
In our society there is no such thing as zero-risk, but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety.	0.9010343398949403
Mr President, I welcome the statement from the Commissioner.	0.8090185770831315
Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea's power and destructive force, which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential.	0.6266787304894518
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika.	0.8049153209456497
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources.	0.7672366831540752
It should be noted that the oil industry, through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol, for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident, or some USD 170 million.	0.7109010611013938
This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners, to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility.	0.8876443828358033
However, before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations, let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented.	0.8253937038286047
Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals.	0.3729395585534725
In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection.	0.5461332937089106
I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions.	0.548587900299614
Calls for design improvements in hull construction, especially double-hulled vessels, are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet.	0.7437558563008594
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection.	0.3863607152704159
Mr President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, mainly in the committees on transport and the environment, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.	0.9701855889536645
Because, as well as the irreparable damage to the environment, the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry, the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry, to the conservation of marine resources, and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover.	0.866317303731292
It is no accident, Commissioner, that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed, those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which, in the majority of cases, do not have any other resources.	0.8230093893411684
These are the same areas, Commissioner, which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts, without any control whatsoever.	0.8214384722357039
I come from a region, Galicia, which has suffered similar accidents in the past.	0.8188812146586768
Brittany and Galicia, two European 'Lands Ends' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks.	0.49633163157795407
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways.	0.7894229266314442
On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fishing industry, to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected, and also by asking them to demand, of international bodies and of themselves, tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience.	0.8442040916549713
In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag.	0.8589057480245407
On the other hand, prevention is essential.	0.29782433851233703
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea.	0.7202670952886764
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal - technological, structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.	0.846750470056907
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, who reminded me of old times when, as the then Mayoress, I lived through similar situations.	0.8411684350821577
We must thank those who, while defenceless and lacking in resources, have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks.	0.7104137305106818
Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, for her reaction to this incident, which has really shaken the whole of Europe.	0.9202588897864764
We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication.	1.0693261555320774
In addition, I should like to make a number of comments:	0.8128276515930225
First, the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA, the Italian shipping register, because we need to know if Community law was applied.	1.0472915309536095
That should be the starting point for our efforts.	0.8152708864970991
Secondly, apart from the shipowners' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage.	0.9133498287145371
Once we have done that, our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified.	0.9054601315116358
However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct.	0.9649054052024055
I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact.	0.9640614463233655
This legal framework is fairly advanced, at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied.	0.8155977242728827
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact, as others have said this afternoon, constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where, since 1967, there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers; more than one every two years.	0.8283833767084793
The economic and social damage, which we have spoken about today, in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources, is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions.	0.9040198761659539
Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented.	0.8917276917167739
I trust that these measures will, in a few months, give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive, possibly - which will put an end, once and for all, to these 21st Century pirates, who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea.	1.0145401355141712
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken, which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues.	1.2666570549218863
I am referring to the double hull, which consists of two layers of steel, with containers divided into two tanks.	0.7262593450154171
Commissioner, there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called 'ecological hull' in which case, in the event of an accident, the seawater penetrates the containers and, as a result of pressure, the oil is transferred to other tanks.	0.8714556441533049
Commissioner, I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures.	0.8879172096901669
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries.	0.8561845034446373
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard.	1.0694258723546315
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents, is bound to support this approach.	0.6818027854578559
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us, after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings, finally to produce a joint resolution.	0.8925049975831387
I think that given the dramatic circumstances, and as a matter of principle, it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes.	0.8727350164560993
On the other hand, Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote, for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area.	1.0013525201798765
I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport.	0.9290690096950652
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area. I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms.	0.9446684545681826
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation, in which we can set standards.	0.9639439333698396
I have also noted, to my great satisfaction, that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty, or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate, and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action.	1.1343135057875895
We sometimes regulate things which could, by and large, remain subsidiary.	0.5875719835885772
In this area we must respond to public opinion.	0.8010732912081675
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are, when all is said and done, on the global scale merely a peninsula.	0.6998329614267651
Therefore, once our legislation has been brought into line, we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law. We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the 'polluter pays' principle of responsibility which is, of course, supposed to be a deterrent.	0.8873035165904141
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport, which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations.	0.816278840279767
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing.	0.7724539987042875
Mr President, the oil tanker Erika, the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which was hired by Total-Fina for the transport of oil, foundered off the Breton coastline, with disastrous consequences.	0.7584380289449707
The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous.	0.8743417004171449
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker.	0.6721126550798955
So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods.	0.3942644710127693
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection.	0.4724344637456237
States can carry out port inspections.	0.2710306922135995
In Europe, legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25% of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive.	0.6483284879389296
However, it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors.	0.858930414296759
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation.	0.6755555744687199
In my opinion, the Commissioner is quite right.	0.9731648385822809
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation.	0.5464824657917525
But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors, esteemed European Commission?	0.5831524434117005
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States?	0.46432676516431587
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored?	0.4320536929961288
Would it not be beneficial, in the short term, following the Rotterdam model, to inspect according to a points system in which, for example, account is taken of the ship' s age, whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience.	0.7250539951294807
In short, to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements.	0.5814849994294989
The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled.	0.44511865908021514
There are four more sister ships in service at present.	0.38104893317859845
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high.	0.6342301145595731
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag.	0.5728289734225189
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen?	0.6569073754375491
Would sanctions not be appropriate, as the Commissioner stated, for the classification society?	0.9561548810221807
RINA is currently the talk of the town.	0.5274701065014523
Malta is entering the accession negotiations.	0.4505844413055347
In my opinion, the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future.	0.7335352131175739
I would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time, and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission.	0.8713866076476148
Mr President, just before I went down into the Chamber, I received an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who had chosen to spend New Year' s Eve on the French coast in Brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives.	0.6205485867834176
Like many other hundreds of volunteers, she had seen the destruction, washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there.	0.6523059743707352
Like so many others, I too wonder where the people responsible are.	0.9865535268571684
Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur?	0.45278061464038893
Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime.	0.6110512355064339
This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks, whether intentional or unintentional.	0.9344581788189866
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.07650392215616267
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament.	0.6623619832191139
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media.	0.5807441306836382
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently, I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected.	0.8399185691964496
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife, in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks, have brought back memories of similar British disasters, such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967, and have prompted many British volunteers to help.	0.7110365744789289
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage.	0.2649091734846072
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions.	0.7232764743450584
Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London, we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10% of the lost oil.	0.7526640344365328
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab.	0.44383553576330737
Ultimately, the polluter must pay.	0.6475466672080572
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered.	0.5704821242829283
Moreover, although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice, I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations.	0.872631343026789
Rather than banning flags of convenience, which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet, under the 1995 EU directive on port state control, national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations.	0.7141845747143168
I sincerely hope that, particularly during the French presidency later this year, the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options, and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament.	1.01139296488179
Mr President, it feels quite strange to be standing here again today, as I have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years, and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence, and not by force majeure.	0.929585135843007
The victims are waiting outside.	0.26194615911892005
They want answers.	0.15107745352546634
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.	0.7510026781580487
The citizens are right to ask: "do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever?"	0.6430078602939856
Who will provide us with new jobs?	0.3660800061458456
When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group, rather it is a joint European challenge.	0.8069247662168321
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio' s action plan with open arms.	0.7842402348322818
It is equally important to note that "prevention is better than cure" .	0.6394515262327545
But there is an art to that as well.	0.6468348010000193
Deploying the German multipurpose ship "Neuwerk" - it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help.	0.6040702556614562
We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew.	0.5742118853736377
Valuable experiences were gained, and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone.	0.7893017609419123
We are therefore right to demand improved controls, sanctions and preventive measures.	0.6161097750143568
I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years, here in Parliament.	0.792233524625883
The issue is as topical as it was before.	0.7381993356623118
Furthermore, I will not withhold my support but will endeavour, alongside my fellow MEPs, to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation.	0.9496211633489319
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my very sincere thanks, not only for the initiatives of the different groups, of Mrs Grossetête and the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, but also for the initiatives of Mr Wurtz and the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left, who proposed this debate, which has led to a positive and important discussion.	0.9497004276658785
Before the end of March, I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts, that is to say, amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament.	0.9833904556755267
I would like to tell you that, in fact, it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem.	1.1471292909978887
There are men and women who depend on fishing, gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas. They are environmentally sensitive areas, but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium.	0.736479245397855
And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation.	0.81801361223368
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done.	0.34442132449548407
In fact, I believe that things have been done by the Commission, but there is still more to do.	1.1099915992910312
This was demonstrated by the Americans who, after the Exxon Valdez disaster, within one year, adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation, which threatens, as I said earlier, to divert ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe.	0.871098505921717
In Europe, after the Amoco Cadiz, or the Urquiola on the Spanish coast, in 1976, or the Torrey Canyon, in the same year, or the many other cases there have been, we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995, particularly in the last few years.	1.0663686313470295
During these years, the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport.	0.6533629448638912
That is the reality.	0.712326993732965
In my opinion, we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems, also deriving from American legislation, which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector.	0.853891245923494
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail, if you wish, in an appearance before a special committee on this matter, or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months.	0.9123545994316431
My intention is - and I insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of March, also coinciding with the Council of Ministers, and, of course, before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency, for us to have texts to discuss.	0.9534419089037363
Flags of convenience are one problem, but are not the only one.	1.0532231637178517
The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but, nevertheless, that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections; more than the countries with flags of convenience.	0.765138682934208
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community.	0.594141311420163
We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end.	1.1682856431341793
This will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union, and to deal with the notorious problem, which will no doubt arise again, of the aim of a Community register.	0.9920434190178022
I believe that this will be difficult but, in any event, we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries.	1.1055676234980623
As for the inspections, very much a key question, the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked, as Mr Hatzidakis has said.	1.1193913925514383
We already have legislation.	0.41545380895401396
According to the information which the Commission services have given me, this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel, means and inspectors.	0.7743817215522457
The problem is not that only 25% are inspected, but rather how we select, how we find, the ships which constitute the highest risk, through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags.	0.8724560094473214
Unfortunately, the 25% often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements: in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily.	0.8200444417040333
Therefore, more than making amendments, we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done, apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews, especially in relation to the age of the different vessels.	0.8595286254342135
And that is why we have SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored.	0.8495185456051723
With regard to the question of Union inspectors, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States, which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately.	0.9709143139242135
Lastly, I would like to stress the issue of liability. Not only in terms of maximum sums insured, which I believe should be similar to those in the United States.	0.9316995931263237
We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments.	0.6725919266340364
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States, but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and, therefore, the liability of shipowners, and also to hold liable those who charter ships, which is to say the owners of the cargo.	1.005221451118364
Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable, we will never, in my opinion, resolve these problems.	0.7841366232900879
I will end now.	0.4746418873239042
I will not expand further. We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions.	1.112473820298962
But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done.	1.2705640641591174
As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety.	1.0536167733032813
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers.	1.2093645459100721
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.4387655520009009
We have taken good note of your intentions.	0.752527396230928
I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement.	0.806428044393327
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	0.25242215024922016
Storms in Europe	-0.0
The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe.	0.7152013462037777
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.5584830298955507
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward, particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union, in terms of the help that we can offer them.	0.9209594812865851
In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2.	0.6356334263279203
I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it.	1.0250944785902423
In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid.	0.6964060034724475
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.	0.5396125328717274
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one.	1.0892524739890983
Let me explain.	0.27571176498077743
I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest.	0.8512993165862164
Indeed, for some 'forestry' districts, which have lost 20% of their trees, this represents a huge loss.	0.9963389295738649
We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more.	0.8064993673526226
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years.	0.528803442266559
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues.	0.5442504383730599
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.	0.999861339226536
It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one.	0.8828269813688738
Indeed, you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate.	0.6813477702637221
On the other hand, districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer, as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years.	0.7077712892406292
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case.	0.541894497443609
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is, and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could.	0.957923196881013
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, although there has indeed been an economic disaster, the real ecological catastrophes are still to come.	0.8152417453092017
As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change.	0.9489349538059587
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact.	0.7732152582511701
Mr President, everyone who has travelled here by car, train or aeroplane, has been able to see the extent of the damage, particularly in France, caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month.	0.7835075574163725
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster?	0.8295027190622293
Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who, on a daily basis, have had to reassure their constituents, organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services.	0.8574551408592831
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens.	0.46487349855097454
Next, I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union' s Member States who, in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation, came to support the efforts of their French colleagues.	0.8970022299751608
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid.	0.5706693418186651
If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims, but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so.	0.9801322293530746
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly.	0.7729630340637562
I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies, which have been particularly badly hit.	0.7203159055408912
As you said, Commissioner, we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to FIFG for investments that have been totally wiped out.	0.7063950944453313
Beyond this, I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected.	0.8252738349523688
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and, on the contrary, to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments, which they urgently need.	0.9245279056881415
Mr President, the storms which devastated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused, as has been said, 90 deaths and damage to a value of FF 75 billion, i.e. EUR 11 billion.	0.7380970301733798
Almost three weeks after the disaster, several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones, 500 000 hectares of forestry land, or 100 million cubic metres of forest, have been ruined, and our historical heritage has also been affected, as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates.	0.7477695732968135
It seems quite natural that given such a disaster, national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected.	0.7421862064486403
As the previous speakers have said, and as you said, Commissioner, in response to my fellow Member, Mr Martinez, with regard to another tragedy, the floods in November in the Southwest of France, you have certainly noted these disasters with concern, but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued, which has resulted in this shocking paradox. This paradox, pointed out by the previous speaker, is that it is easier, a great deal easier, to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the Union than within it.	0.9733416331442855
We know full well that what you are doing, Commissioner, and that is, limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b.	0.7441436098787152
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000.	0.5357982551693834
I can show you a copy if you wish.	0.48942020087518845
We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission, but also of this Parliament, and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so.	0.9331489705787489
But for pity' s sake, and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way, please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms.	0.7680019993913968
As a matter of urgency, therefore, we must restore, within the framework of a supplementary budget, the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters.	0.8586876109878586
We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union. That, however, is another problem altogether.	0.96642022183354
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium.	0.6182086805378659
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December.	0.5571374398148791
These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests.	0.3251022571101187
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region, Lorraine, which have suffered enormous destruction.	0.7444073673709688
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities, the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but, unfortunately, their troubles are not yet over.	0.8975243814000275
It is Europe's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster.	0.7439595656183827
I welcome Mr Barnier' s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced.	0.9728559178301639
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter, as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this.	0.7153449482700512
The Community action programme for civil protection, established by a Council decision on 9 December, was launched on 1 January 2000.	0.8513931258728674
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity. This programme must work at full capacity.	0.7666103288319827
Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry.	0.8471875092810044
Our priority, as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up, is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States.	0.8125947647256954
It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads, and to repair them as quickly as possible.	0.9417691384640835
Lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure.	0.34869108212943634
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest, and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood.	0.6406856757913294
Finally, it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood, in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls.	0.7639876692003903
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States.	0.444641996505548
This aid for gathering timber is, of course, only the first stage of an aid package, which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas.	0.8401294631460626
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over.	0.8101106204935573
This is a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies.	0.7098413512875147
It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity.	0.80622503616454
If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile, it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry.	0.7166310516487436
Hurricane "Lothar" should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here -, but to switch to the precautionary principle, under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too.	0.6776906337004257
Current programmes must be accelerated.	0.22667290293312145
For example, as they stand, the Commission' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto.	0.798929425001449
The trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem, it shelves it.	0.6845015982770335
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term.	0.6113094812345549
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources, as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases.	0.7437619528257506
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject, and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate!	0.9820908902559816
Commissioner, Mr President, Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto.	0.5559774116686358
However, it has now achieved notoriety.	1.1385131824802013
The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims, mainly in France and Germany, but also in Switzerland, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.	0.8086326024766816
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons, roofs, traffic signs and, ultimately over the forest.	0.48531947653741186
We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber, and this is only an estimate.	0.7552296676669427
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner, and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany.	0.7477964263060909
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual.	0.7411836665944062
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region, or in a 5b region?	0.8829998414681848
What answer will the Commission give, when it is on the scene, when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building, and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc.? All this is well-intentioned advice.	0.8887846592303936
However, I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage.	0.95858950377361
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.	0.6110355543978371
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid, so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date.	0.8238094088567028
Mr President, Commissioner, permit me, first of all, to make reference to two facts.	0.7044274095785782
Firstly, at the beginning of 1999, NATO, with the participation of most Member States of the European Union, flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom.	0.7398030519294919
We are now endeavouring, at huge cost, to get the country back on its feet again and help its people, and rightly so.	0.9252392439428179
Secondly, at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU.	0.6235190502110941
The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders.	0.5968823503671012
"We do not have the wherewithal for that," they said.	0.835029469446177
This is wrong!	0.16822447234148213
And no one can comprehend this attitude.	0.4934038580083871
Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss.	0.42777393262550806
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity, also from within this Community.	0.7596654194900979
I say they have a right to solidarity.	0.601335407458011
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need.	0.7634188169576442
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms.	0.9224127719799425
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority.	0.2850434322554569
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will.	0.7158440621087858
Permit me one further comment. Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm, the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter.	0.8827488212736609
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency.	0.7004132312237928
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations.	0.5817519381056022
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment.	0.5575353456129672
Then, for example, people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart.	0.6102719603698584
When, in 1994, over five years ago that is, I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament, I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier.	1.0017882448136244
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work.	0.8740900856472871
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again!	0.737409608403794
Mr President, Commissioner, the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems.	0.5382005882725732
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters.	0.5187156685873494
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be.	0.4614586852439653
Of course, there is a need for solidarity here.	0.661068662696989
There is certainly a need for European civil protection, and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters.	0.998298675190007
But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes.	0.8104469658050691
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density, the type of infrastructure, and, of course, the many monocultures, if we are talking forests.	0.9986770044643135
Of course, I am in favour of providing assistance where we can.	0.7381196124961537
But when it comes to aid, we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future, more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground.	0.7370314547385365
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation, rather than monocultures.	0.5225435023357443
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate.	0.7991164775632771
To this day, we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream, and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff.	0.9065194778873117
America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go.	0.6260431974964455
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream.	0.4170219297983804
But in common with others, we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect.	0.7981436709258221
This is partly the work of human hand, as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations.	0.9687287263813519
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference.	0.7491585283334944
We must reduce CO2 emissions, employ renewable energies, and generally make enquiries, in this connection, as to how the forests of Europe are faring.	0.9555575575426952
Mr President, I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims.	0.8400970937798541
This is an irreparable loss.	0.7101158889766982
Secondly, we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens, and the solidarity of other countries with France, which is the country worst affected.	1.0274894224014024
As I have little time, Mr President, I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution.	0.7322309545704171
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not.	0.6947796971089873
That is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities, in general terms, are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years.	0.7929151741091435
In fact, over the last decade, the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century.	0.7813402446803406
Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals.	0.6493057833587285
Secondly, I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner' s proposal to create a European civil protection body.	1.119215688025792
Furthermore, we should utilise an extraordinary budget line, since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation.	0.9937177952662278
First of all, we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy.	0.8268933631851075
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards.	0.5339638427595216
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this.	0.7418401407212929
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this.	0.8685383123875687
That is important.	0.36785357417822145
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past.	0.8901625314064163
It was very small.	0.26310108567504686
It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major.	0.7521737516637371
Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels, whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies.	0.6842310675194999
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished.	0.6089399724003304
I think we should reinstate this budget line.	0.646710260264159
When we had the earthquake in Greece, which was a big disaster, the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks.	0.8502370986800997
The same when the floods came in France and the same again now.	0.7028265282983301
These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it.	1.2236112006554496
We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument.	0.6218296253635651
We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it.	0.6036172936570176
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic.	0.6771764020639202
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these.	0.714226742022975
Ladies and gentlemen, none of us must forget what has taken place.	0.4857588845254323
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines.	0.8965720260225842
It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development, forestry would be eligible under Article 33, companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds.	0.7447252371715661
It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical, active solidarity.	0.6381745431989905
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul.	0.7179221446637328
This is inadequate, and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which, moreover, I expressed when I told the press in Bordeaux what I am hoping for, and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security.	0.8617721312831298
If the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being, if the mandate that our President, Mrs Fontaine has staked on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe' s citizens is to be effective, our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency.	1.0109348611345563
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force, real civil relief blue helmets, who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union, as we currently have no emergency procedure, but also outside the Union if needs be, in Venezuela or anywhere else, is something that we should hope to see. I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit.	0.8716165028132968
Mr President, Commissioner, when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation, we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly.	0.8428279556054943
Nevertheless, the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us.	0.8222657923572788
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well.	0.4884989949175648
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously, and at the same time, from my position here in this Chamber, point to how important it is to support these regions and people.	0.8990220368945158
Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow.	0.5919518149114402
What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible.	0.7607056647588996
For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long.	0.7782775609165656
For instance, it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle' s larvae, and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have.	0.9130145621426581
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives.	0.7371026348972817
Decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry.	0.5750783113777137
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow.	0.5655524668152491
The calculations are in decades rather than years.	0.25993310939256176
In addition, I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production, for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions.	0.6847950986557391
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared.....	0.6730837998087655
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.07650392215616267
Mr President, I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms.	0.8739904838998651
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries.	0.7903670147547617
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank.	0.37681757113336806
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland.	0.7835073418760057
We had high winds and unprecedented, prolonged rainfall which, adding to existing difficulties, resulted in thousands of acres being submerged, sometimes, in up to 15 feet of water.	0.5618958231079179
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms, no sanitation, no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water.	0.6551311771264589
I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water.	0.24238984942857247
Natural habitats were destroyed.	0.16566718039239428
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case.	0.5887430655427629
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force.	0.7593378150221503
Mr President, Commissioner, I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims.	0.7772194319433479
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe.	0.7620610761968545
For the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe, and I believe we need, in the long-term, to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future.	1.058224946756372
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests, but maybe we should set up a system, perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector, which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way.	0.9520350298808437
Unfortunately, we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future.	0.9796184824480042
As has already been mentioned here, there are indications - no proof, but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe.	0.8884084778055332
Of course, the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet, but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing, these storms will, of course, hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century.	0.8051686744189656
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours, Tom Spencer. He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women, we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time.	0.7812133566619481
However, an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP, for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate, rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability.	0.7470208555308773
We must be aware of this connection; I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm, but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course!	0.8988872530301601
I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	0.5780961348932127
That concludes the debate.	0.1437775861795048
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday.	0.9161769451527844
Food safety	-0.0
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission.	0.7548493180149285
Mr President, I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to Parliament the main lines of the Commission's White Paper on food safety, adopted on Wednesday last, 12 January, in association with my colleague, Mr Liikanen.	0.9746686273411396
At my hearing last September, I promised speedy delivery of this White Paper.	0.6098549219421253
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly.	0.7679906250236768
The White Paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new Commission was appointed last September.	0.5331239545947676
It takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the Commission's Green Paper on food law was published.	0.764916198557432
Equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge, as well as the BSE crisis.	0.5121697913291786
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed.	0.9145986338753327
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months.	0.691358259069506
The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world.	0.6802087291395252
When I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth.	0.6479709838633853
The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe.	0.5885847157886027
If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions. This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers, producers and industry generally.	0.5634639033012943
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually, even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects.	0.5199667387129961
Between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees.	0.51168964957323
High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness.	0.44955563872019394
This crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety.	0.5778357872560322
In saying all of this, I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems.	0.857996005940074
The challenge is to make the system the very best.	0.8411113742843185
The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food.	0.684423987339801
We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change.	0.5181092307453722
The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule.	0.9631596320479698
We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders.	0.9491875726396103
The White Paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing EU food legislation.	0.4496182532221926
All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent, understandable and flexible.	0.7512028904087474
We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers.	0.6452724247361443
The detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years.	0.6079009132844945
Over 80 measures are envisaged.	0.2428211603284659
Our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002.	0.7011148901904926
We are also envisaging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime.	0.7887587164581397
This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate.	0.5896458322947328
It has already attracted much comment, including reactions from Members of Parliament.	0.7378534022278358
The chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments.	0.5040095277923974
We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage.	0.6780630448040732
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments.	0.8922948417677313
The Commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence.	0.7073489495786948
Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change?	0.601890294798039
The first key concern is independence.	0.2676172557539462
Key stakeholders, including consumers, are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests.	0.7042088338432471
We must also ensure excellence and transparency.	0.6418007726817195
We have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis.	0.7593541658762225
However, the Commission believes that we must go further.	1.2665479249028977
We must create a permanent and truly independent, excellent and transparent system of risk assessment.	0.5074653236038469
The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety.	0.751546487722087
We envisage that the work of the existing five Scientific Committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority.	0.6508365046464462
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority's establishment.	0.8363200931589341
However, if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs, this would clearly not be enough.	1.0334174312848596
As the White Paper makes clear, the new authority must be a value-added structure.	0.849137994815406
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened.	0.7771498307106751
Within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists.	0.5418852941897017
I am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react, identify issues before they become crises.	0.594438773298876
This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority.	0.4301455645364696
To be proactive the White Paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority.	0.5753019273276452
These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function, the coordination of scientific information in the EU, and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States.	0.7134544837664871
As part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns.	0.48447774326732734
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority.	0.7291876786212462
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	0.738778407369319
I make no apology for this approach; I firmly believe that it is the correct one.	0.7810148865802952
Certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority.	0.708460382986354
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion.	0.5924412872773744
It was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process.	0.883935551206338
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be, in my view, a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability.	0.7372416881837712
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter.	0.9370254424429648
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority.	1.0134506760923874
I also reject this line of argument.	0.353912736879484
How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety?	0.4905699773261983
Would this be in the interests of Europe's citizens?	0.5395695846785125
In my view, most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based, rationally argued and fully justified.	0.5570086488623684
It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving.	0.35881699360183344
I can assure you here today that the Commission, in exercising its risk management functions, will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority.	0.9394949128495433
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States.	0.7001406895608282
This is a major task.	1.0030060638358786
We must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the European Union.	0.6240149778188765
The authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues.	0.5996541730814626
This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself.	0.582967434796844
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science.	0.7926605963153328
However, with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies, the authority will become pre-eminent on the European stage.	0.7922421330605238
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard.	0.9629796879442212
As an integral part of a value-added structure, the White Paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication: to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk; to be highly visible; to tell the good news story about food; to be proactive.	0.8380500261765543
The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls.	0.4896255917512
This is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are complying with Community legislation.	0.7096271440730064
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena.	0.7268624816471608
In this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in Dublin.	0.7068709572891447
This revised Community framework would have three core elements: operational criteria set up at Community level, Community control guidelines, and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control.	0.7116561907096405
As part of our proposals in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the Commission.	1.1759902532912618
These could include withholding Community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a Member State.	0.382160599840291
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world, boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union.	0.7540544968574521
In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community-level, the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community's legislation, covering all aspects of food products from farm to table.	0.8920104664140782
It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation.	0.47353614673748795
The new legal framework will cover animal feed, animal health and welfare, hygiene, contaminants and residues, novel food, additives, flavourings, packaging and irradiation.	0.43698145173143277
It will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers, farmers and food operators, traceability of feed, food and ingredients, proper risk analysis through, for instance, risk assessment - that is, scientific advice and information analysis - risk management - that is, regulation and control - risk communication, and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate.	0.7705693318823676
As regards the precautionary principle, I might add that the Commission is currently finalising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon.	1.0713972871265678
I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available.	0.7121449072687305
However, having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees, I recognise that this was not feasible.	1.0064577391174299
But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper's proposals on the authority.	0.9114411772111263
We now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission's ideas on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority.	0.9660136531768958
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate.	0.8909044111903467
Parliament played a crucial role in Europe's response to the BSE crisis.	0.6036953288525418
It has especially active since then in bringing citizens' concerns about food safety issues to the fore.	0.5198452065169663
I expect that Parliament's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive.	0.7229297681607173
While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our views, I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe.	1.0103352364318534
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible.	0.715274611596432
It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union's food safety regime.	0.912882909374037
The European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU's food safety regime in the years ahead.	0.8078310077381543
It is essential that we get the mix right.	0.8392346252304954
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement.	1.04645700839645
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions, including the Commission and Parliament.	1.068730078624388
That is very much the right approach.	0.9046946386072475
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight.	0.9763727835415652
I hope that we can thrash this out.	0.7624475115361794
We need a body of food law, as you have said, and we need to agree this together.	1.1282360508552778
It is very important that we include liability in that process.	0.7050169213491277
That is the one word I am talking about.	0.7395527628911387
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong.	0.3924820862439493
That cannot continue.	0.13971473039343202
When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem, those responsible are liable.	0.9012073070971169
Mr President, it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority.	0.9106138490074722
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed.	0.5382439051369374
You are unclear about this in your White Paper.	0.43521445920186697
What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list?	0.7615460894689441
When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof?	0.7013573244209748
The final part of my question is as follows: when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States?	0.5841827755635556
That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper.	0.8909803584757853
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.	0.8483325790421842
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality.	0.7862307565456326
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one.	0.9386145417110766
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs.	0.6670050889025952
However, as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years, I have to ask: if Europe has the safest food control system, as you have said, why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives?	0.8818279257704918
Secondly, will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States?	0.7818656173081789
We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this.	0.5246014479211335
Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws, given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003?	0.7142720284327406
President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper.	0.774051896552062
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised.	0.856378569712396
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability.	0.4205493772577975
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability.	0.9175392468188008
Once that is done, issues such as liability can be addressed.	0.4495895316823703
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved.	0.7924710921936787
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration.	1.0580839537671773
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list.	0.544899356152833
That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation, and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material.	0.996437891082827
At the moment the list is, as I say, a negative list and it is added to as required.	1.0609374367067985
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it, 2002 in fact.	0.7024157855752092
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation.	0.7258520584828179
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed.	0.5020756144453071
This is unfortunate and it is wrong, and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done.	0.9657940695827028
The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in Member States is ongoing, I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way.	0.8194443851589299
I hope that the next time you ask me the question, I will be in a position to give you more detailed information.	1.0035428402996525
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation.	0.5873335785241867
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation.	0.7410870934549683
It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation, although that is part of it, but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them.	0.8582635346884986
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind.	1.150954288116616
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen.	0.8475464394195688
Commissioner, the ignorance of certain Member States has landed us in a major food crisis here in Europe, and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance, and that on the day that you present your interesting report.	0.9211554185642066
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind, whatever name it goes by, will be given influence over the Council, who in this authority will have the say in matters, and who will issue orders.	0.9747611979053863
Of course, we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content, but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam, and even extending them.	0.8653878145976247
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that.	0.8563871183481727
I also welcome the White Paper.	0.480981136291815
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France's refusal to lift the ban?	0.7153628030854168
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting.	0.7073014180183145
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance, similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment?	0.9118308617054665
Mr President, you said during last week' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery was.	0.833508219892649
For example, the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters.	0.6934753489259966
It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather, publish and coordinate data, make recommendations for improved food safety, and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers.	0.836148790924707
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union.	0.7211748391390209
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location?	0.6680657512805522
In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time.	0.6907232146234867
In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board.	0.9614918055992168
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board.	0.7155284509693052
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months.	0.9429807971088704
I envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders.	0.5497791249298599
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September.	1.0623560370880987
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September.	0.9256924094318791
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.	0.6150793870662099
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice.	0.5380189649349082
But it would have an overall remit, particularly, for instance, in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research.	0.9015899888593606
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that.	0.6073142222246767
That is an issue for consideration and discussion.	0.8068149223038696
There may be a number of views on that.	0.6621778132592453
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board.	0.9211908866801379
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament, through nominees or even MEPs themselves, were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated.	0.7948584859211938
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out.	1.02151568988277
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity.	0.48234859763748605
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile.	0.9071687100728502
It must be visible.	0.3763159224709827
It must be known.	0.4598995002830556
Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority.	0.8812240688391835
The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known, who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food, particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition, diet and such issues, so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority.	0.7131945459751814
They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority.	0.7032707701864952
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous.	0.6075634495059122
It must be visible.	0.3763159224709827
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority.	0.6492009280347437
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth.	0.5782165712013446
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end.	0.738405748924926
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level.	0.8368595274604824
Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for, or advising, the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level.	0.6206103169623166
That is an undesirable situation, we do not want that situation in the future.	0.9802932056458495
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one.	0.5085426376244292
But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern.	0.6284488691685021
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists, that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond, where experts are to be found elsewhere.	0.805870495487176
Over time, as I said a moment ago, not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise, its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged.	0.8391488505880842
This situation can be achieved over a period of time.	0.605898519058916
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence. It is something that is earned over a period of time.	0.6769704589296862
However, the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	0.9651825307788997
I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but, nonetheless, the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward.	0.9941124186980979
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way.	0.7742095705206214
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance.	0.893138459106874
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process.	0.7494709143977976
In relation to grants and subsidies: yes, consideration has been given to that issue.	0.5476389850252897
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought, particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling.	0.7566524191117449
In relation to Mrs Lynne's question on interim payments: that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues.	0.815321775369949
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority.	0.497527790702937
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	0.791719180754224
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!	1.207942020787039
But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority.	0.4432579563869107
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin.	0.7174285863886729
The Food Safety Authority's situation is quite different.	0.5483247476544756
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation.	0.9060555177425845
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean, what problems they have identified, what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise.	0.9221615118012684
Equally, the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process, to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified.	0.8306647363882029
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located.	0.7160649164916686
Scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and, in those circumstances, as scientists will have to travel, it is probably better that they move to a central location, once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based.	0.9308987843058735
That is my judgement at the moment.	0.7126609559041777
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	0.7639174367019558
Colleagues, I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda.	1.0438926472617418
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents.	0.852885360593995
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important, I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them.	0.7403584033067769
On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner, and his statement.	1.0559322904736492
As you can see, half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session.	0.6224480060528613
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions.	0.9456050112518422
That concludes the debate.	0.1437775861795048
Question Time (Commission)	0.24375550524597958
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	0.7981355582070562
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time.	0.27637790399714735
We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session.	0.44745504623868293
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion.	0.4183630551899801
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda.	0.7932836258134767
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda.	1.2242841045443618
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m., and you can see the clock.	1.0001865387534412
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event.	0.9315428338429825
First Part	-0.0
Question No 28 by (H-0781/99):	0.21060117828112435
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	0.3009477741083714
Turkey's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	0.417066869379243
What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	0.46044343962085926
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.47276751572491543
The Commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu, Turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards.	0.7412455912299164
According to our information, the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet.	0.8751252868362002
The Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority.	0.5374935775510755
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production, including the nuclear option.	0.7418558677789345
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.	1.0540478194715595
In particular, the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site.	0.820137953280867
According to information received from the International Atomic Agency, the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana.	0.7044785191667179
Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site.	0.6698160102813296
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material.	0.7567514490101588
It acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.	0.6678629671417626
Thank you for your reply.	0.45945798593595527
I should like to make the following points: Turkey is now a candidate country.	0.9749912911334908
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2%.	0.33500061106501733
At the same time, it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada, which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India.	0.8486848423042188
In this sense, there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology.	0.7404493899458687
So much for the political aspect.	0.5216399270094572
Now to the technical aspect. The safety factor in this type of project, and I am speaking as an engineer, has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty.	0.8989600090366978
In cases such as this, where there is uncertainty, simulators are used.	0.7194202034883899
However, we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy.	0.7844296706400008
In this sense, all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this.	0.5816096746234757
Therefore, and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed, it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union.	1.061853726018251
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries.	0.7176493716311495
I have explained the position of the Commission.	0.5759953751529108
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety.	0.8785431535431542
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable.	0.6746983829196802
In the case of Turkey it is different.	0.48039940570464906
The plant is not yet there.	0.5483306606517543
I have already said that Turkey is part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.	0.9007254954659143
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey.	0.69681207208709
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.	0.6567144104250071
Mr President, the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty, it has signed the nuclear safety treaties: why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community, and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter?	0.9479281729326925
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears.	1.1140640879714416
I do not have these concerns.	0.7922620158839181
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty, but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament.	1.067522028442231
Question No 29 by (H-0786/99):	0.19729794177784402
Subject: Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict?	0.5172137944211832
If not, why not?	0.49778651847860494
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.5454777847261313
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your question.	0.9869106915126592
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action.	0.9385021354578562
As early as last June the Commission financed a first study. It was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe.	0.6956398141854159
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment.	0.3399550949706721
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force.	0.8426992910649884
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it.	0.954465336550726
The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net.	0.6521710913218913
The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict.	0.5898280120913891
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission.	0.27830909310693647
However, this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium.	0.6602671181259149
From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks, if any, are limited to an area around the target.	0.6702440592118337
Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed.	0.7924821846777836
It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed.	0.4929229329287008
First of all, Mr President, can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response.	0.9238339780985342
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue.	0.9454595289017259
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used.	0.8267852708556472
This uranium becomes air-borne, is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far.	0.7373225248463495
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war.	0.7074980348195632
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects, not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo?	0.877688371943915
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons?	0.679127831617211
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for that question.	0.9662672714836659
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo.	0.7437590335491464
But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium.	0.702629042675193
That is also mentioned in the report.	0.6691577705900896
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.	0.5990177356678391
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted.	0.9484831959401051
A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report, so they have to take responsibility.	0.9469116640297418
But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is, for the time being, the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union.	0.8864792859710694
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States, as well as the United Nations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment.	1.02793734359318
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons.	0.6941846769917646
Mr President, Commissioner, in a few months' time, hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday.	0.6439325156252215
We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast.	0.38491699652734807
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer, and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect?	0.7477558258399167
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to.	0.5723176903758421
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this.	0.4544909240368704
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do.	0.5333437171714266
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous.	0.8641006815726083
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution.	0.7292732765694387
That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system.	0.7661400258076406
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise.	0.8322646947685023
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area?	0.8263449725101922
I cannot answer that question.	0.29239725617513906
When it comes to medical checks and so on, I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer.	0.8835559130273488
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned, that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan, but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that.	1.040824127335995
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information.	0.8142059475513591
Question No 30 by (H-0793/99):	0.19807819647664007
Subject: Appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in exile received over 4000 Tibetans who escaped over the Himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb.	0.5553137666631814
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way.	0.4426884833874346
The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet.	0.8291364117021994
The Tibet Intergroup, therefore, gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama?s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet, calls on the Commission to appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue.	0.7997664721100332
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet?	0.44081101242608134
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.4572750682418604
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared.	0.7170300630092956
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues, including Tibet, firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities.	0.7636163243628932
The European Union did that at the European Union­China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues, including Tibet.	0.7769722914157023
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.	0.45544335386471324
I urge the Chinese again to do so.	0.5343706150870103
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities.	0.5394729774247314
We are also doing a number of other things: in the European Union-China human rights dialogue, we have focused on a number of practical steps, including sending experts on assignment to Tibet, planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health, education and training for Tibetans.	0.8181871964351538
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them.	0.7317017304875937
But for my part, I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts.	0.8954581555744487
It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile.	0.6616419122813496
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, however worthy the cause.	0.7554000875616197
Mr President, Mr Patten, of course, you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China, and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate, something which has always been blocked hitherto.	0.8756903690813944
However, if your response was to be that we should turn to "Mr CFSP" , that is, to Mr Solana, then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter.	0.9682134843347217
Your approach, which I am very much in favour of, since it is a coherent one, takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights.	1.0728160933288295
Imprisonment, torture, the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth, are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum.	0.8341484716558997
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this, then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve.	0.8760088361698858
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place, but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation, would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.	1.024910576851626
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is.	0.5843889994140433
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the Council.	0.635290009704254
As it happens, we deal with the budgetary consequences, the Council makes the appointment.	0.9923519077669128
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course.	0.5577780139506954
Putting that on one side, because that is the situation, it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues.	1.0703505742267758
I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out, among other things, that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union.	0.9262377068075985
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world.	0.676043399604809
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet.	0.9282160030717461
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice, first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest.	0.7931925506721792
If I can make a literary commendation to the honourable Member, who I recognise is interested in these subjects, I recommend to him a book published just before Christmas written by Isabel Hilton, the distinguished journalist, on the problems of Tibet.	0.7575141109566746
Mr President, I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting, which betokens peace and happiness.	0.724916072225405
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned, rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace, serenity, compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans.	0.8720653133851765
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness, the Dalai Lama' s, proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair?	0.6833816956243799
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people.	0.7192648559185809
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition.	0.5927138120159714
Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama.	0.49973256317232223
It is an extremely moving account, not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well.	0.9020114254520166
The Commission, like others, has urged dialogue.	0.8546464094882537
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes.	0.5686870368777075
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama.	0.5305779692273894
At or around the time of President Clinton's visit to China, the President of the People's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda.	0.7188429506426608
It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue.	1.0142250692412709
Question No 31 by (H-0795/99):	0.21699091759320668
Subject: Commission's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizens? right to proper administration in the EU.	0.7328560971440374
Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration, it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made, but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service.	0.9043260886956243
Are these reports accurate?	0.2147336572963749
What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way, and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration?	0.8943220654569477
Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September, and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it?	0.8561356878283795
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.4572750682418604
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate.	0.526905363383371
In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure.	0.6715895291126696
At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document, a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks.	1.0547748947735192
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.	0.7493739467913375
It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code.	0.8665091908838506
The Commission would like to stress in particular that, in the drafting of the code, it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman.	1.2453582163438048
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission's administration with the public.	0.9415063258690812
It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.	0.8081738797128426
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman's office.	0.7924252165987732
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself.	0.8312142344568073
However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform.	0.948410784650916
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner.	0.8212852312772733
However, I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force, bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997.	0.9356514892971994
The newspaper reports were misleading.	0.20976328631639785
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman.	0.933247959881659
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that.	1.0560857095486074
I want to repeat that honourable Members, like the honourable Member who asked the question, who take a particular interest in this issue, will want to have a dialogue about it.	0.9173682258851482
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member.	0.7688261879908299
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer.	0.940284448842964
For safety' s sake, I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that, where the Commission and good administration are concerned, there is no part of Jacob Söderman' s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable.	0.9782959414283714
Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved?	0.8240930910865037
Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true! "I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999".	0.9342983624572619
Both documents, that is the Commission's document and the Ombudsman's draft, cover largely the same ground.	0.9160953178197758
