Although there are a few isolated reports in the literature suggesting that sugar beet pollen is highly antigenic, hypersensitivity to components of sugar beet is not a common disease.	0.5961754460087476
We report a 29-year-old man with a history of atopic dermatitis who developed both contact dermatitis and allergic rhinitis from sugar beet pollen through his job in a seed nursery.	0.5805410157325059
Establishing nursing science at German universities has become more and more consolidated.	0.40182469887744815
At the beginning of this establishment there was an evident backlog especially compared to angloamerican and scandinavian countries.	0.4987062030900913
Today - 1997 - more than 40 nursing science courses exist at German high schools and universities.	0.5388542966441543
Active glucocorticoids (GCS), such as cortisol or corticosterone, are a prerequisite for the induction of surfactant synthesis in the fetal lung.	0.572216483039696
In fetal serum, biologically inactive metabolites (cortisone or 11-dehydrocorticosterone) outweigh the active forms.	0.31555481960603765
In this study we demonstrate with organoid cultures of fetal rat lungs that the reductive side of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD) regulates the intracellular activation of GCS.	0.6106694175654013
The inhibition of 11-HSD by the licorice extract glycyrrhetinic acid completely inhibits this central metabolism.	0.3854290769134276
On the other hand, GCS induce the reductive activity of 11-HSD and, therefore, they increase their own activation by positive feedback.	0.4947669822552844
In a community sample of 394 eldery aged 61 years and older from East and West Germany, diseases, contacts with general practitioners and specialists, the use of medicine, attitudes regarding health and illness, the subjective health, psychic problems, social support, social integration, social burden, and socio-demographic variables were assessed.	0.6680570918762059
Based on these data the determinants for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine were analyzed.	0.532230467717715
The results confirmed the frequency of multimorbidity in the elderly; on average we found three different diseases at the same time for each person.	0.6937863761198516
In nearly 10% of the sample we found seven diagnoses existing at the same time.	0.5774218685165159
88% had contact with a general practitioner at least once a year, 97% had contact either with a general practitioner or with a specialist once a year.	0.7773276676414798
55.8% took at least one medicine each day.	0.4979395253007841
The number of diseases existing at the same time was the most determining variable for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine.	0.5796826230626082
Furthermore, the elderly had more contact with physicians and took more medicine if they thought they were susceptible to diseases in a high degree, and if they rated their own health as poor.	0.6800922634566219
Fewer contacts with physicians and a lower use of medicine were found in those elderly that rated health behavior as little useful, that had low control beliefs regarding their own health, and that experienced only a low degree of health-related limitations in their everyday life.	0.6966228142281364
Furthermore, we found a higher use of medicine if there was little social support.	0.7927327804810708
There were no significant age-related or sex-related differences regarding the contact of practitioners or the use of medicine.	0.6971687148507655
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD: Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) are chronic inflammatory and frequently relapsing diseases of the gut that ultimately lead to destruction of the intestinal tissue.	0.5706098429473246
Recent evidence suggests that a pathologic activation of the mucosal immune system in response to antigens is a key factor in the pathogenesis of IBD.	0.6077947216126943
Furthermore, changes in cell migration and cytokine production appear to contribute to the perpetuation of IBD and the postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease.	0.5103236270588428
Based on recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD, several new therapeutic strategies are currently being tested in clinical practice, including recombinant anti-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-, IL-10, IL-11) and inhibitors of cell adhesion molecules (ICAM), proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-12) and their receptors (TNF, IL-6R).	0.7017976054744731
Dysregulation of apoptosis may play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).	0.4444929203278734
A defective clearance of apoptotic cells or inappropriately high rates of apoptosis may lead to a pathologic accumulation of abnormal cell material with a secondary autoimmune response.	0.476216592081936
Experimental findings in apoptotic keratinocytes and C1q knock-out mice suggest an important role of C1q in the clearance of apoptotic cell material.	0.4999367602643505
In addition, there are several links between C1q and SLE: Most the patients with C1q deficiency develop a SLE-like syndrome.	0.6358434850712862
SLE itself often causes secondary C1q deficiency and autoantibodies to C1q are detected in almost all patients with active lupus nephritis.	0.5341219030516636
These observations suggest a central role of C1q in apoptosis and in the pathogenesis of SLE.	0.6017115346235988
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the causes and accident mechanisms that lead to injuries in infancy involving buggies and prams in order to establish strategies for accident prevention.	0.5368432911581907
The discussion about the implementation of telemedicine and teleresourcing and its consequences has been under way for some time now.	0.5217532664849368
The rate at which telemedical applications are being developed, leaves little time for consideration of the economic, scientific and social aspects.	0.5541564723238431
There is a need for integration of all the existing fragments into one coherent telemedical concept.	0.5013968409942803
Different aspects of telemedical concepts are discussed.	0.2453114811454504
A 34-year-old woman who was separated from her husband, was killed by him by strangulation and several stab wounds in the chest.	0.5487045122028971
The post-mortem examination was carried out approximately 5 h after death.	0.4930987019848535
At the place of discovery one swab of her right and one of her left neck side were taken.	0.4067737480634748
Additionally, a swab was taken out from the front side of the collar of her polo-neck pullover.	0.5529275185970342
It was obvious that the skin of the neck below the larynx showed a fabric pattern leading to the assumption that the collar was temporarily pressed between the hands of the suspect and the neck of the victim.	0.6114401140283814
DNA typing (short tandem repeat-PCR) of these swabs led to the detection of mixed patterns for the swabs of the neck and the collar which matched the patterns of the victim and the suspect.	0.7127866317273753
A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed to evaluate the use of self-reinforced absorbable composites (Biofix) in the fixation of ankle fractures.	0.840096243547528
The aim of this study was to demonstrate that fixation with Biofix rods and screws is as good as the standard A. O. fixation.	0.5972133028489794
The benefits of Biofix rods and screws are: a reduction in costs since no secondary operation is needed, prevention of stress-shielding and thereby diminishing the risk of bone porosity.	0.5949961646277351
Patients aged between 16 and 75 years old with closed, non-comminuted fractures of the lateral and/or medial malleolus and dislocation of the fracture fragments greater thean 2 mm were included in the study.	0.6532765407837793
22 patients were treated with Biofix rods and screws and the control group of 19 patients with a standard technique.	0.8586279869483368
After 3, 6 and 12 months, rontgenograms were taken.	0.6607836386259314
At the same time functional results were evaluated following the criteria of Olerud and Molander.	0.6689946365020737
Two patients were withdrawn from the trial for non-medical reasons.	0.5959532852383173
22 patients (12 from the Biofix group, 10 from the AO group) operated two or more years ago were contacted to see if any complications had occured since they were last seen.	0.5777848088333963
In 4 cases a Biofix screw broke down just beneath the head during insertion.	0.3934497019767458
This did not result in an insufficient fixation of the fracture.	0.6715867392037267
There were no early post-operative complications.	0.6503241271184463
The functional and rontgenological results in both groups were equal.	0.701737099491496
In three cases a sterile sinus developed at the site of screw insertion.	0.506804635121994
Biofix rods and screws, made of polylactic acid, are a good alternative for the fixation of fractures of the ankle.	0.8441430381222699
The use of resorbable fracture fixation material has the advantage that a second operation to remove osteosynthesis material is not necessary.	0.5647882522556515
The long term results are good.	0.7222035173760817
There is, however, a possibility of development of tissue reaction to the resorbable material.	0.593474628232373
In current textbooks of dermatology, lichen amyloidosus is said to be a papular, intensely pruritic type of amyloidosis of unknown aetiology.	0.5466424874738937
When this concept was developed, there was no way of discriminating between the different types of amyloid.	0.6215719296716526
It is now known that amyloid in lichen amyloidosus is not derived from immunoglobulins or serum proteins, as it is in systemic amyloidoses, but from keratin peptides of necrotic keratinocytes.	0.6515272796962285
Even several years ago, chronic scratching was invoked as a possible cause of damage to keratinocytes in lichen amyloidosus.	0.49730942164744724
In support of this hypothesis, four cases are presented.	0.5583745100064482
Apart from amyloid in the papillary layer, all biopsy specimens revealed histopathological signs of chronic scratching (epithelial hyperplasia with hypergranulosis and compact orthokeratosis, coarse collagen in vertical streaks in the stratum papillare), such as are also found in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus.	0.43521818120978056
Lichen amyloidosus is considered to be a variant of these conditions.	0.7018316150157388
Just as in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus, pruritus seems to be the cause and not a symptom of the papular skin lesions.	0.5845334773803914
Consequently, treatment of lichen amyloidosus should not be directed at removing amyloid, but at improving the pruritus.	0.6910931604611394
Ulcers in chronic venous insufficiency, especially in postthrombotic syndrome, are often resistant to compression therapy.	0.7210817815635294
They can be treated effectively by the dermatologic surgeon with a fairly simple operative procedure.	0.520653403094339
The removal of the ulcer together with the extensive lipodermatosclerosis by Humby knife (shave-therapy) and immediate grafting with a meshed split skin graft - possibly in combination with ligation of insufficient perforator veins - yields very good success rates.	0.5516535133950389
The results in 13 patients (18 legs) with an average follow up period of 11 months (up to 20 months) are reported.	1.1531056445470018
The literature from 1990-1997 and 3 personal cases are reviewed to give an update on findings and current therapy for adder bites.	0.5190683741661424
Bites of the adder (Vipera berus) are rare.	0.49231183970956643
Symptomatic treatment usually leads to complete restitution, death due to adder bite is rare.	0.3222582523155265
The main venom effect is the development of - sometimes severe - edema, hemolysis and disseminated coagulopathy, very occasionally followed by lethal renal failure.	0.6160093095434196
Significant intoxication is very unlikely if 2-3 h after the incident, no signs of intoxication can be found.	0.6418611024244499
Background: The use of high-tech communication is undoubtedly growing and has become established in almost all sciences and research fields.	0.5410688762961108
This article surveys the possibilities for scientific data-exchange via the Internet, the world's largest computer network.	0.5348479809395977
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are known to exhibit far less cardiac side effects than tricyclic antidepressants.	0.5062125290234116
We report three cases in which the SSRI, paroxetine, induced clinically relevant ECG changes in patients with high risk profile.	0.6587609948443054
In two cases an increase in QTc time was observed, severe bradycardia was also observed twice.	0.6603077845459154
Objective: Cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is not very helpful in the management of patients with whooping cough, since culture takes three to five days until results are available, and only about 30-60% of patients may be detected by this method.	0.7669813949208197
In order to improve the laboratory diagnosis of whooping cough, different protocols for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were developed.	0.637942752472504
With the introduction of each new technique for registering eye movements, the question arises concerning whether these provide a reliable and accurate alternative for the  diagnosis of labyrinthine dysfunction when compared to the most commonly used electro-oculographic technique.	0.696415867093366
To answer this question we compared mean slow-phase velocity (SPV) using three different recording techniques: electro-oculography (EOG), video-oculography (VOG) and infra-red oculography (IROG) during four different types of examinations.	0.5280414201946542
The examinations were the eye target tracking test (ETT), horizontal and vertical optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) tests and the rotating chair test of the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (HVOR).	0.4117250085423233
For the ETT tests the VOG provided consistently higher mean SPV values with low variance, presumably because of the accuracy and stability of the calibration.	0.51276215502446
For the horizontal OKN and VOR rotating chair tests no significant differences were found between the mean SPV obtained with the different recording techniques, although the IROG recordings were associated with a larger variance.	0.70452400887625
Vertical OKN mean SPV was consistently lower with IROG and VOG techniques presumably because of non-linearities and resolution limitations inherent in these techniques.	0.3574403337196917
These results indicate that the EOG technique despite its disadvantages of noise, time to apply and variability of calibration still provides an inexpensive, reliable and accurate means of measuring slow-phase eye movements.	0.5741341670189888
Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the plasma levels of the circulating adhesion molecules sICAM-1 and sE-selectin could serve as early predictors of developing sepsis and its severity.	0.6269919968539396
Problem: The data model given in the  DICOM standard is examined unter the aspect of system integration.	0.6270378845367174
Semantic properties of the IODs (information object definitions) and their relationships are investigated.	0.6439230032239666
Thoracic disc herniation is rare.	0.1656025363438959
Pain is the most common initial symptom, followed by sensory disturbances and motor involvement.	0.6851118046214932
By the time of diagnosis, 90% of the patient have signs of spinal cord compression.	0.8780483686914735
A 42-year-old woman was operated on because of shoulder pain.	0.6359773291041043
During her stay in hospital, the patient first demonstrated uncharacteristic pain and after 2weeks an incomplete paraplegia caused by herniation of the T10/11 disc.	0.5355734114584488
Degenerative changes have been considered to be a cause for spontaneous quadriceps tendon rupture.	0.6205377591573289
Aim of this study is to investigate the microvasculature of the quadriceps tendon by injection techniques and immunohistochemical methods (antibodies against laminin) with regard to the pathogenesis of tendon degeneration.	0.720156570081721
The blood supply of the quadriceps tendon arises from descending branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery, by branches of the descending geniculate artery and by branches of the medial and lateral superior geniculate arteries.	0.6798652594892141
Blood vessels penetrate the tendon from the surrounding connective tissue and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network.	0.3757999239376741
Compared to the surrounding synovial layer, the amount of vessels in the tendon substance is greatly reduced.	0.6000028009660945
The distribution of blood vessels within the quadriceps tendon is not homogenous.	0.5534824673509503
The anterior or superficial part of the tendon has a complete vascular network that extends from the musculo-tendinous junction to the patella.	0.49650446811976245
Within the deep portion of the quadriceps tendon there is an oval shaped avascular area which measures app.	0.48390570110058345
30 mm in length and app.	0.29447668730081933
Within this area the immunohistochemical proof of laminin is negative.	0.3522662067359856
An explanation for the absence of blood vessels may be compressive stress caused by the patellar groove which serves as hypomochlion for the quadriceps tendon when the knee is flexed.	0.47770899070712686
The occurrence of an avascular zone within the deep layer of the tendon that is directed to the joint cavity may explain the frequency of degenerative changes in this region.	0.60129074390572
When looking for the possible cause of distortions in values measured for the determination of breath ethanol concentration (BEC) in artificially respirated patients, consideration must be given to the humidity and temperature of the gas examined.	0.5865002404322076
In the present study, the effects of humidified and warmed and of dry and cold air on the accuracy of a newly developed BEC measuring device, as compared to a reference model and to a conventional system, were examined in a lung model.	0.7916930599999733
Total or partial relapses after conventional surgical advancement of the maxilla following Le Fort I osteotomy in CLP patients are frequent and major complications.	0.4919410692925233
The aim of this investigation was to find out whether the technique of distraction osteogenesis in these patients shows more stability and whether maxillary distraction is able to replace conventional advancement.	0.6629172412693612
Maxillary distraction was performed in 12 patients.	0.7143937849487945
In two cases, a Delaire mask was used to bring the maxilla forward, ten patients were treated with the extraoral distraction device designed by Polley.	0.6742319129468657
In all patients, planned advancement of the maxilla could be achieved; one partial relapse occurred.	0.6469984977346943
The results indicate that distraction osteogenesis offers the possibility of advancement of the maxilla with the required stability.	0.556627811403259
The technique presents a major improvement which is achieved with a relatively minor surgical procedure.	0.48027284533799
We report a rare case of primary primitive neuroectodermal tumour of the bladder in an adult.	0.6524309332244104
A huge tumour with extensions into pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue was found radiologically in a 62-year-old man.	0.4936989309299969
The patient did not complain about remarkable clinical symptoms until 4 days before admission to hospital.	0.3810289641873603
Histology of diagnostic transurethral tumour resection showed a small round-cell tumour with focal necrosis and scattered Homer-Wright rosettes.	0.38056946783450507
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that tumour cells stained positively with O13, a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the membrane glycoprotein p30/32MIC2.	0.45911286973580884
Focally, tumour cells stained positively for vimentin, NSE, S-100 protein and synaptophysin.	0.5155998904197693
The patient died 3 weeks later because of fulminant pulmonary embolism and autopsy revealed a huge, partly exophytic but mainly endophytic tumour of the bladder with extensions into the rectum and retroperitoneal tissue.	0.6435077840831619
The differential diagnosis of small round-cell tumours in this location is discussed.	0.5419839954665163
Lesions of the acetabular labrum should be treated by correcting the causes.	0.7905606162947849
In a steep acetabulum where the femoral head brings the acetabular labrum under tension and traction, the acetabulum should be rotated by triple pelvic osteotomy to slightly overcorrected acetabular measurements.	0.48302829218700444
Severely diminished acetabular and femoral anteversion can also lead to tears and impingement of the labrum.	0.3840139653632088
Then rotation of the femoral neck and/or rotations of the acetabulum by triple osteotomy to 15-20  ° of anteversion are indicated.	0.7273679312993073
Our triple osteotomy technique differs from that of others mainly in the ischial osteotomy.	0.4202343290103926
It is performed from the posterior approach between the sciatic notch next to the ischial spine and the obturator foramen and is directed 20-30  ° anteriorly from the frontal (coronal) plane.	0.5309289322241335
The osteotomies therefore are placed close enough to the acetabulum to allow free rotation, but they do not interfere with the circulation of the acetabulum, and the ligaments between the sacrum and ischium are left in normal tension.	0.6345228281087602
Our normal values of the acetabular position were tested by correlating the measurements with the absence of pain.	0.5705951619897285
The optimum is reached with a CE angle and a VCA angle of 30-35  °, an angle of the weight-bearing zone of +5 to -5  ° and a migration index of 10-15 %.	0.6873124090895195
Overcorrections again caused pain and should be avoided.	0.3710374597614259
Diminished anteversion of femur and acetabulum towards 0  ° also caused pain and should be corrected by triple and femoral osteotomy to 15-20  ° of anteversion.	0.5508749061653722
In earlier follow-ups of 216 hips 5-10 years postoperatively, 82.3 % of the joints showed no change in the degree of osteoarthrosis.	0.7543658269009155
Survival rate curves regarding the absence of pain demonstrated that pain was experienced again when joints were corrected insufficiently or overcorrected, while in good corrections the joints were free of pain in about 75 %.	0.5850458483280956
Background: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is associated with point mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that appear to be pathogenic for this disease.	0.5097983579903658
These mutations affect nucleotide positions 3460, 11 778 and 14 484.	0.37978947865641777
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT type II) is an immunoglobulin-mediated, drug-induced side effect for heparin-treated patients with thromboembolic complications.	0.810291198623059
With an incidence of 1-3 %, mortality of 20 % it and permanent disability for another 20 % is a clinically relevant disorder.	0.7640062833939918
With heparin treatment or prophylaxis frequent platelet count monitoring is necessary.	0.3096581307386912
With HIT type II the thrombocytopenia is often a harbinger of thromboembolic complications in the venous or arterial system.	0.45472009538474867
If HIT type II is suspected, further heparin exposure is to be stopped immediately and another anticoagulant therapy should be started.	0.6664470963762067
The two anticoagulant options in Germany are discussed.	0.47764800663386037
At the same time the diagnosis should be confirmed by laboratory testing, including testing for cross-reactivity with danaparoid.	0.6834442017639
Further therapy depends on the symptoms.	0.34377923907578367
In the case of clinical relevance of this disorder we should think about prophylaxis: strict indications for perioperative prophylaxis only use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for routine prophylaxis, use of LMWH for thrombosis treatment and early change to cumarine.	0.5846402905123086
A patented low-temperature polymerization method for methylmethacrylate (MMA) infiltrated bone marrow biopsies is described: it has been developed from our previous MMA technique and is a patented procedure.	0.5887169700899384
Differences from the previous method are (1) removal of stabilizer from the MMA monomer before its application, (2) the use of a different starter, (3) avoidance of O2 influence during polymerization by means of vacuum exchange with N2, and (4) polymerisation in a water bath to draw off residual heat.	0.6321322389609012
After this procedure, all immunohistochemical reactions are possible provided that the previous fixation is adequate.	0.5694333395858305
The effects of different fixatives are reviewed briefly without detailed analysis.	0.4185035552993778
Technically, this plastic embedding can be performed at least as rapidly as the classic paraffin embedding after decalcification.	0.6636942241443192
The advantages over the latter method are: (1) the cells can be better differentiated because semi-thin sections can be made; (2) the immunoreactions can also be performed on the basis of semi-thin sections, which means they can be interpreted more easily; (3) morphometric analyses yield more reliable results because of the constant thickness of sections; (4) osteological examination of bone trabeculae, especially the search for mineralisation deficiencies, is possible; (5) the plastic embedding procedure is less dependent on individual instabilities in the quality of performance of the staff members involved.	0.7257060481756443
Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the costs for additional equipment necessary remain below DM 100,000 including an excellent microtome.	0.4874559380144276
The routine use of succinylcholine for endotracheal intubation is being increasingly questioned.	0.5519515457518721
Initial studies have suggested that a combination of propofol and alfentanil without a muscle relaxant can provide good intubating conditions.	0.48468130796584685
However, most of these initial studies either did not have a double-blind design or did not include a control group with muscle relaxants.	0.7185266536341243
In this study, intubation conditions using fentanyl/propofol without a muscle relaxant were compared with the combinations of fentanyl/propofol/succinylcholine and sodium thiopental/succinylcholine.	0.5656512390883278
Nosocomial pneumonia is still a common problem, especially in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.	0.7822167143979631
The endotracheal tube contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of pneumonia in these patients, because it facilitates microaspiration and impairs host defense.	0.5560202494672237
Common nosocomial pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa are known to produce exopolysaccharides and generate a complex biofilm structure, which allows adhesion to abiotic surfaces and protection against antibiotic action.	0.49417052394852073
Multiple studies have identified bacterial biofilm on the inner lumen of endotracheal tubes, which represents a permanent source of infectious material.	0.5219642889866166
Endotracheal tubes, removed from patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, are covered more frequently with biofilm than those of uninfected controls.	0.5129537778245818
It remains unclear whether this represents a source of infection or contamination.	0.49142451268652904
Bacterial biofilm, however, may play an important role in recurrent pulmonary infections of the intubated and mechanically ventilated patient.	0.5055094343226819
Computer-guided robot-assisted surgery in cementless total hip replacement requires exact preoperative planning at the 3D workstation Orthodoc.	0.5241889913216612

This study provides evidence for effectiveness of retrograde ureteral Double-J stent placement as a therapeutic option in cases of severe symptomatic hydronephrosis during pregnancy with a low morbidity rate.	0.6404937621111108
Between 1981 and 1994 at the Bergmannsheil Ruhr University Hospital in Bochum, Germany, we treated 145 patients with femoral diaphyseal nonunions following initial operative treatment.	0.5370845911482245
Of these patients, 138 received this initial operative treatment at an outside institution.	0.5048610062491306
The primary reconstructions for the fractures utilized plates in 112 cases, reamed nails in 24 cases and external fixators in 9 cases.	0.4435095247431565
The average age of the patients was 35 years and the mean time from the initial operative treatment was 2 years.	0.9933718968068898
Twenty-seven patients (19 %) presented with a hypertrophic nonunion and 118 (81 %) with an atrophic nonunion.	0.7841056361139691
There was a significant correlation between primary "classic" plating and development of an atrophic nonunion (2-test: P < 0.01).	0.6781726696831691
We observed 34 wound infections (23 %) with no significant correlation to the type of primary osteosynthesis.	0.8443264246325128
We determined that 73 of the pseudarthroses were due to improper osteosynthesis techniques.	0.2843035732309472
Of these cases, 41 % involved the use of plates, 83 % involved the use of reamed nails, and 78 % involved the use of external fixators.	0.6843898239589827
Fracture location near the diaphyseal-metaphyseal junctions was common in this problematic group.	0.2967499631241136
Ninety-two percent of all plates led to atrophic nonunions.	0.38714746646125503
There were 21 open fractures and of these 90 % (n = 19) developed an atrophic pseudarthrosis and 29 % (n = 6) developed a wound infection.	0.6977762931301549
Fifty-seven (39 %) of all patients had additional injuries, but we found that did not increase the risk of disturbed bone healing.	0.8475172130358238
Our revision operations focused on the elimination of wound infections, refreshment of bone healing, and improvement in fragment stability.	0.559391665319977
Only 28 % of all "classic" plates and 11 % of all external fixators were changed to an intramedullary implant at the time of the first revision surgery.	0.7775058592296596
Hypertrophic nonunions required a mean of 1.3 revision operations to achieve bone healing whereas a mean of 2 revision operations were necessary to fuse atrophic bone ends (P < 0.05).	0.5682227380112973
In cases of diaphyseal pseudarthrosis healing time was not affected by the type of osteosynthesis used for primary reconstructions.	0.5153672939367382
Since lack of fracture healing can often already be observed directly from postoperative X-rays, we recommend that revision procedures be performed early.	0.6176714117259436
The prolonged length of time to care for femoral nonunions underlines the importance of appropriate primary fracture treatment.	0.38980857119883905
That takes into consideration both the biomechanical and the biological aspects of bone healing.	0.5305571935836657
Background: In a prospective trial (October 1996 - April 1998) the effect of octreotide and tamoxifen on the recurrence of pancreatic carcinoma after R0 resection was evaluated.	0.7823618902975746
Methods: Patients with a local recurrence after curative resection of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with 100 µg of octreotide three times a day and tamoxifen 20 mg once daily.	0.7546970197230495
The median survival time, quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-30) and side effects of the octreotide-tamoxifen group were compared with a historic cohort (n = 14) of patients treated in our department (9/95-9/96) according to the "best supportive care" concept.	0.7985326259137564
Results: Recurrences were diagnosed after R0 resection in a mean time of 13  +/-  6.8 months.	0.6886055701808146
Patients treated with octreotide and tamoxifen had a significantly (P < 0.05) longer median survival time (7 months; range: 3-12) vs 3.5 months; range: 1.5-5).	0.7782093615311948
The octreotide-tamoxifen group suffered less from lack of appetite, nausea, fatigue, and pain and needed fewer analgesies.	0.5594802622077165
The only side effect of the octreotide-tamoxifen therapy was moderate diarrhoe in 2 patients at the beginning of the therapy.	0.6700677943483079
Conclusion: Since combined therapy with octreotide and tamoxifen can be administered comfortably for outpatient treatment, this seems to represent progress in the palliative therapy of pancreatic cancer.	0.6604607456818602
Objective: To study the influence of dopexamine on pulmonary shunt and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction during major thoracic surgery with one-lung ventilation (OLV).	0.49499115859082726
Design: Prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled study.	0.5933373791024815
Patients: Twenty adult patients undergoing elective pulmonary resection.	0.45597826449905854
Anaesthesia: General anaesthesia was performed using propofol, fentanyl, N2O and vecuronium.Volume-controlled ventilation was performed to maintain normocapnia over the whole investigation period.	0.6309534372336087
During OLV, the tidal volume was reduced and the respiratory rate was increased to avoid a peak airway pressure exceeding 40 cm H2O.	0.5691018288666
Furthermore the FiO2 was increased to 1,0 and the external PEEP was removed during OLV.	0.63302978289122
Interventions: The patients received either dopexamine at 2 µg/kg/min (group A, n=10) or 0,9% saline as control (group B, n=10) after assessing the baseline values.	0.8352548589213472
Measurement and results: The following cardiorespiratory variables were recorded: Heart rate, mean arterial pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure.	0.6501376950667844

Cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index, pulmonary vascular resistance index, oxygen delivery index (DO2I), oxygen consumption index and the venous admixture were calculated using standard formula.	0.6068719216315139
Furthermore, pressure-flow-curves were constructed to analyse flow independent changes in the pulmonary vascular resistance.	0.5996185114266533
Data were recorded at the following times: After induction of anaesthesia in stable haemodynamics during two-lung ventilation (baseline values, T0), intraoperatively during one-lung ventilation (T1) and postoperatively after re-establishing two-lung ventilation (T2).	0.505694505706859
Patients characteristics, data from the preoperative lung function testing and surgical procedures did not differ significantly between the groups.	0.7865712545405642
CI increased in the dopexamine group from 2,5 +/- 1,2 l - min-1 - m-2 (T0) to 3,6 +/- 0,9 l - min-1 - m-2 (T1) and 4,0 +/- 1,3 l - min-1 -  m-2 (T2).	0.8383454647864691
The course of the intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting did not differ between the groups.	0.6204407417166868
In the dopexamine-treated group the DO2I increased from 430 +/- 143 ml - min - m-2 (T0) to 652 +/- 255 ml - min - m-2 (T1) and 653 +/- 207 ml - min - m-2 (T2).	0.6123212813493012
Regarding the pressure-flow-curves there was no difference during OLV between the two groups indicating no major blocking effect of dopexamine on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.	0.5976227879996597
Conclusion: It is concluded that dopexamine can be used to improve haemodynamics and oxygen delivery during thoracic surgery without increasing venous admixture during one-lung ventilation.	0.6179235984751796

Regular examinations of prostitutes may reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in this high risk group.	0.5036937087208638
Therefore since April 1988 regular mandatory examinations have been offered by the regional health office in cooperation with the Department of Dermatology of the Ruhr-University of Bochum.	0.513671254829562
The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance and efficiency of such an examination.	0.555156212942874
The study was based on anonymous questionnaires.	0.6376515141395671
Mean age of the 80 prostitutes was 31.4; 67 of then were born in Germany.	0.5636523136954505
78 of the women always used condoms, while 71 thought that condoms prevent STDs.	0.5455254244833301
Three women suffered from a STD in the last 12 months.	0.7299778458096521
The majority the women (75 from this 80 prostitutes) did not perceive the examination as discrimination, while 71 felt the examinations were of high quality.	0.6406251871353533
These results indicate that regular mandatory examinations should be part of health prevention care of prostitutes and that they are well accepted and tolerated by these women.	0.5318171724591584
Atrial fibrillation and related arrhythmias are common after cardiac surgery.	0.5008955642905814
As more and more elderly patients are operated on for cardiac diseases, the interest in this arrhythmia is growing again.	0.6020111850345125

Reevaluation of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery by review of recent literature.	0.6137561887841354
Usually postsurgical atrial fibrillation is transient, self-limiting, and benign.	0.6863584698511856
Nevertheless, among patients affected by this arrhythmia, morbidity, mortality and costs by hospital stay are higher than without this complication.	0.5992909516881798
In addition, postsurgical atrial fibrillation can increase morbidity and mortality by itself.	0.4908369916416098
Today, general recommendations for prevention of atrial fibrillation following surgery do not exist but may be developed in the future.	0.73895267764076
According to the clinical course, therapy has to consider ventricular rate control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and rhythm control.	0.7921896401341662
Usually therapy is restricted to the postoperative time.	0.5303524903760665
Atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery has to be respected in order to minimize overall complication rate.	0.6289659985400097
The influence of aspirin treatment on haemostasis is still under debate.	0.4353485127619104
There are doubts in emergency operations, especially in transplant patients, concerning dosage and change in medication.	0.5861407393072828
Our results are based on an analysis of the therapeutic approaches in German transplantation centres.	0.7845908843967588
The question of transplant suitability, dosage and haemostatic effects are discussed with respect to the literature.	0.5867466035098069
Some 92.11 % of the transplantation centres perform the operation even though the patient has been treated with aspirin.	0.7511063834354478
In these cases an increased bleeding tendency is tolerated and observed in 34.2 % of the centres.	0.6596210666797492
An increased mortality has not been reported.	0.6395377467241858
Most of the transplantation centres accept a dosage of 100 mg aspirin daily.	0.5044785527107468
Only 7.89 % of the transplantation centres refuse to operate on aspirin-treated patients.	0.5711083891567998
Correctly indicated aspirin treatment (for cardiac arrhythmia, embolism, or thrombosis, for example) does not contraindicate renal transplantation (daily dosage up to 100 mg).	0.6507023233489218
In elective surgery, however, a preoperative change in medication is recommended, e. g., the heparin instead of aspirin.	0.5388342295759614
Full-thickness defects of the thoracic wall following tumor resection, irradiation damage or secondary wound healing in thoracic surgery require early interdisciplinary cooperation to achieve patient-specific treatment modalities.	0.5813579539386855
Plastic surgical differential therapy allowing for sufficient soft tissue coverage, stabilisation of the thoracic wall and space filling in intrathoracic cavities, is presented and critically discussed.	0.6082820579518292

This retrospective study presents the results of 41 patients with a lateral clavicle fracture eight years after the treatment at the Staatliche Orthopädische Klinik of the LMU München in the time between 31.10.1979 and 31.10.1994.	0.6999338490578232
It could be shown that the lateral clavicle fractures, due to their variety, hold a special position among the clavicle fractures and thus need a differanciated therapeutic procedure.	0.514171240905155
Among the operation methods the K-wire stabilisaton with cerclage was the most often chosen operation technique i.e.	0.48625018601985287
The K-wire without cerclage was used in two cases.	0.6448343112647529
Twelfe fractures were treated with AO-plate-osteosynthesis.	0.44901550298006304

Single stage urthroplasty with an onlay patch graft of penile skin or buccal mucosa is an effective treatment for patients with complex anterior urethral stricture disease.	0.4897876766577929
Using buccal mucosa, operative time is substantially reduced by using a two-team approach in which one team harvests the graft from the mouth while a perineal team simultaneously exposes and calibrates the stricture.	0.5126416800530487
Excellent results can be expected using grafts urethral substitution in men with refractory bulbar strictures.	0.4839901627418721
Focal areas of severe stenosis may be excised from the graft bed.	0.38100360337376554
For patients with long or dense strictures, grafts may easily be combined with other tissue transfer techniques.	0.5443515050233636
Background: As the slit-lamp technique is an restrictive method for the in-vivo examination and documentation of the multi-layer structure and the dynamics of the tear film and the cornea, e. g. during wound-healing processes, our aim was to find out whether it is possible to change the confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (CLSO; Zeiss) into a high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) for the visualization of the anterior segments of the eye and the tear film by adapting a special objective system.	0.7023341804427246
In order to gain information concerning the function of such a cornea microscope we examined selected patients with erosion or pterygium before and after operation and subsequent phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), as well as some in-vitro corneal surfaces after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).	0.6014111358890262
From 3 years' experience with nearly 100 transinguinal preperitoneal mesh prosthesis (TIPP) repairs for recurrent inguinal hernia the indication, anesthesia, modification of the technique, and results are reported.	0.5584847196736624
After intraoperative classification of the hernia, the TIPP repair is indicated especially in large defects of the posterior wall (L/M III).	0.7015387180755347
The procedure is easily performed under local anesthesia.	0.4694266113536151
During 52 local TIPP repairs, conversion of anesthesia was never necessary.	0.38329676386710954
Important technical details include the requirement for a sufficient size of mesh (10 cm x 15 cm) and a certain caudal and cranial fixation of the prosthesis using at least three interrupted stitches for each.	0.6955085323037191
Apart from an increased number of seromas (12 %) in the early postoperative period, the results of the TIPP are comparable with those obtained after Shouldice repair for recurrent hernia.	0.7810028344837444
The rate of hematomas, infections, and testicular complications range between 1 % and 3 %.	0.8472861938269597
Considering the negative case selection of only large recurrent hernias, the TIPP repair reveals a favourably low 1-year recurrence rate of 1 %.	0.64173757645147
If representatives of the law suspect anyone of drug smuggling by internal bodily concealment and refers the person to hospital, the doctor is requested to recover the ingested drug packets by induction of emesis with syrup of ipecacuanha or apomorphin a.	0.4362439747001638
The permission of this induction as a coercive measure is controversial.	0.2968121041118208
The policemen, the public prosecutor or the judge has to decide, whether the induction of emesis is really necessary, the physician has to declare the risks.	0.6055042464390686
Especially when there are only a few drug-containers and the person is no professial "body-packer", non-invasive diagnostic ways also can lead the evidence of incorporated drugs.	0.5900385754523597
Rupture of the drug containers leads to acute intoxication and the physician must regard the person as his patient, he has to refuse the role as medical expert for the representatives of law.	0.5934963050790684
The deformity in severe spondylolisthesis consists of two components: the parallel anterocaudad slip of the spondylolisthetic vertebra, and its tilt into kyphotic malposition.	0.5313266573872765
The influence of the two components is very different: the anterocaudad slippage has not much impact on the sagittal profile of the spine and is easily compensated for by a slight increase in lumbar lordosis.	0.7156347809656998
The kyphotic deformity has a high impact on trunk imbalance and the sagittal profile.	0.45823777944975047
There are two compensation mechanisms: hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine to its anatomical extremes and - if that is not sufficient - verticalisation of the sacral bone, performed by contracture of the hamstrings and uprighting of the pelvis around the hip joints.	0.6016670862799746
The latter mechanism is followed by functional disadvantages.	0.40009188879164664
Therefore, correction of the kyphosis of L5 may be considered during operative treatment if the lumbosacral kyphosis (angle delta) is less than 85  ° and the sacral inclination less than 35  °.	0.6156335243804397
The diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities includes analysis of the geometry of the whole leg.	0.6597009696558239
The first step in the diagnostic process is a standardized physical examination.	0.6418095663225306
It provides valuable background information for an effective radiological diagnosis.	0.4437429829327129
Even with a thorough standardized physical examination it is not possible to define exactly the deformity or decide on an operative procedure.	0.5908705837152318
The diagnosis of axis deviations in the frontal plane can be measured on a conventional plain X-ray of the whole leg.	0.6865420863301898
In this view it is very important that the knee joints are in a true a. p. view independent on torsional deformities of the lower legs.	0.6846959456828496
Today the gold standard to measure the torsion and length of the lower extremities is the CT scan.	0.6485090756739362
However, the multitude of analytical methods for CT measurements described in the literature do not lend themselves readily to comparison; thus, it is difficult to identify a clear method of choice.	0.6411991170324178
Not every CT measurement is better than a physical examination.	0.37219803752259467
Evidence of reproducibility and accuracy is a prerequisite for useful interpretation of the results.	0.5004349658436805
Up to this point in the literature there are only reference values for the Ulm CT Method.	0.8084210780405429
One alternative is the MR scan, which avoids radiological risks, but the reproducibility and accuracy of the MRI method are not as good as for the CT method.	0.7417610580072646
Another alternative is ultrasound, where recent advances in the measurement of torsion and length of the lower extremities have proven competitive with or superior to the accuracy of MRI.	0.6658940523258913
The three-dimensional determination of the torsion and length of the lower extremities by ultrasound has now assumed a leading role in the non-radiological diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities in children and adolescents.	0.6571039534175832
This method furthermore is increasingly being used in preoperative planning of leg deformities in adults.	0.48169832870178764
Purpose: Management of organ-confined RCC is primarily surgical.	0.3868816874935128
5-year survival rates of all stages improved from 40 % in the 1950th to 50 % in the 60th, and stagnate at 60 % in recent series.	0.9092774862770272
Paramount use of ultrasound in modern medicine has been claimed to contribute significantly to an earlier detection of RCC thus better amenable for radical operation.	0.4336859754576994
Other factors may have been strategies and general hospital care.	0.41329878629808864
However, it remains unclear whether an extended lymph node dissection as suggested vy Robson in a seminal paper in the 1960th bears any therapeutic value.	0.5415025955280847
Selected patients with minor lower limb injuries and low risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), who required cast immobilizing and did not receive medical thrombosis prophylaxis, were included in a prospective study.	0.6980059038634522
The decision to give not medical thrombosis prophylaxis depended on an concept of individualised prophylaxis for patients at risk for thromboembolism.	0.5721678436706639
From March 1994 to March 1996 in 178 outpatients (118 men, 60 women, mean age 25,8 [16-39] years) a clinical examination and a colour-coded duplex sonography were performed after removel of the cast for detection of DVT of the lower limb.	0.6536898675265007
A phlebographie was performed when thrombosis was suspected.	0.26978122497724766
Two patients developed a one bundle thrombosis of the calf.	0.4818919704227494
Clinical appearance of lung embolism was not observed.	0.5047498723578606
These results suggest, that low risk patients with minor injuries of the lower limb and plaster cast immobilisation do not need a medical thrombosis prophylaxis.	0.7575408647107047
For the judgment of the quality of medical services and for the progress of clinical medicine the comparison of data and informations of the diagnostic and therapeutic process is demanded.	0.7602086481640989
Therefore a systematic and concrete system of documentation should be implemented in every clinic, which consists of standard nomenclature, classification, instruments of outcome measure and documentation standards.	0.5241287980727964
There are a group of problems and barriers which stand in the way of this goal.	0.5659873623735577
It is useful to build a minimum basis data set which includes core criterias of clinical dokumentation in orthopedic surgery and include this in an information system so that all of these parts are considered and that a central and comparable data pool is offered for patient care, quality management and research.	0.5445446409216256
Basal cell adenocarcinoma was first introduced as an entity in the second edition of the WHO's "Histologic Typing of Salivary Gland Tumours" in 1991.	0.7410170594636895
This tumor was first described in 1990 by Ellis and Wiskovitch from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).	0.3832867918755141
Basal cell adenocarcinoma accounts for about 2.9% of all salivary gland malignancies.	0.7682896868690561
More than 90% of the tumors are situated in the parotid gland.	0.6811187688167248
Intraoral manifestations are known from case reports only.	0.33468373930919787
Tumors of the palate have been mentioned in three cases.	0.5465669323918596
Histologically this tumor can be easily confused with basal cell adenoma and the solid basaloid subtype of adenoid cystic carcinoma.	0.43753776635626435
The case presented here is a middle-aged white woman with a basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.	0.6034945814583372
Therapy consisted of surgical extirpation with three-dimensional safety margins and histologically proven clear resection margins.	0.41823763323152696
Knowledge at this point indicates that basal cell adenocarcinoma has a rather high probability of local recurrence (up to 50%) and a mostly lymphogenous metastatic potential for as long as  10 years after removal of the primary tumor.	0.7615483262921907
Ten year survival is around 75%.	0.3269000645523706
Purpose: To study the incidence and shape of subclinical keratoconus with corneal topography in the fellow eye in the case of clinically, slit-lamp biomicroscopically and topographically diagnosed unilateral disease.	0.5179233930753152
Ischemic heart disease is the most frequent cause of death in industrialized countries.	0.8432235307691212
This is a result of persistent risk factors and aging of the population.	0.7193496204424206
Medical progress with application of conservative, surgical or interventional strategies indeed reduced the morbidity and mortality of arteriosclerotic diseases, but markedly increased the medical care costs.	0.650034565284048
The result is a discussion about the optimal use of the different therapeutic measures under consideration of the evidence based medicine.	0.7384884956074999
The ileal conduit is a simple and safe supravesical urinary diversion with few postoperative complications.	0.4397920077026855
In patients with liver disease with portal hypertension, however, the risk of recurrent, peracute conduit bleeding is increased.	0.6034786203916084
While the diagnosis is simple, several therapeutic options are available.	0.7344236973331204
In most cases the bleeding comes from stomal varices, that can be controlled with local sclerotherapy with 3% Ethoxyscerol or ligation of the bleeding vessel.	0.6626630004985742
The resection of the part of the conduit carrying the varices is an option if bleeding is life threatening or the source cannot be localised.	0.5610254135748811
If bleeding recurs excision of the conduit should be considered.	0.48273111718091644
Malignant disease must be excluded as a bleeding source.	0.48425637347308276
Objectives: The cardiotoxic properties of bupivacain have been well documented under in-vitro, as well as under in-vivio conditions.	0.5716878496898766
A further mechanism of cardiovascular impairment by bupivacaine via the central nervous system gained investigational interest in animal studies.	0.392916474369394
The aim of our study was to demonstrate the effect of a ventriculocisternal perfusion of bupivacain on systemic hemodynamic variabels and their reversability by wash-out with mock-CSF.	0.5181812091394614
In recent years, our knowledge concerning pathophysiological changes in brain metabolism after traumatic brain injury (TBI) has greatly expanded.	0.636721270283737
This, in turn, has enabled the development of specific pharmacological strategies for the supplementary treatment of brain-injured patients with the aim of reducing secondary brain damage.	0.7280401744026483
The present article focuses on the pathophysiology of TBI and the possibilities for pharmacological intervention.	0.5864433893421862
While some of the substances reviewed are presently used in the treatment of TBI, others are under experimental and clinical evaluation at different stages.	0.5604667791619025
This study explored characteristic subjective experiences of schizophrenia.	0.25989948378800076
A questionnaire for self-assessment of disturbances in several cognitive and perceptual areas (the Eppendorf Schizophrenia Inventory, or ESI) was constructed and administered to first-episode schizophrenics (SCHe, n=45), negative syndrome schizophrenics (SCHn, n=45), remitted schizophrenics (SCHr, n=24), depressives (DEP, n=43), alcoholics (ALK, n=48), obsessive-compulsive patients (ZWA, n=46), and healthy controls (KON, n=57).	0.5051313058661366
Comparisons between the SCHe, SCHn, DEP, ALK, and ZWA groups and a subsequent factor analysis revealed four schizophrenia-specific dimensions: attention and speech impairment (AS), ideas of reference (IR), auditory uncertainty (AU), and deviant perception (DP).	0.5074325322420096
Further analyses suggested that the AS syndrome may represent a mediating vulnerability factor while IR, AU, and DP probably are reversible episode indicators.	0.4499827082702571
The results may contribute to refinements in the measurement of specific prepsychotic signs, thus facilitating the development of early intervention approaches.	0.5480465845487122
Introduction: The conservative treatment of the most severe cases of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) can be sometimes frustrating.	0.8270243888383342
Especially with an underlying autoimmunologic disorder, even the application of artificial tears as often as every 5 min may not prevent further damage to the ocular surface.	0.5625748337743381
A microvascular transplantation of the autologous submandibular gland (SG) can be performed by a maxillo-facial surgeon as an alternative approach for those cases.	0.645990024475297
We report 2 years of ophthalmological experience with the results of this procedure.	0.8612233630889011
Aims: The predominant cause of death due to oral cancer is the failure to control local tumor due to regional tumor recurrence.	0.6270825814176691
The sequelae of surgical resection and high-dose irradiation cause substantial changes in head and neck anatomy, leading to considerable problems in the early morphological detection of recurrent disease.	0.7176573110632367
Therefore, this study evaluates the verification of cancer recurrence by means of its pathologic glucose metabolism.	0.6593392063470794
Materials and methods: We reviewed a total of 50 [18F]-2-fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) investigations performed in 44 patients who had undergone surgical resection of oral cancer.	0.75442945569929
In 23 cases, re-staging (group A) was indicated due to suspicion of recurrent or secondary tumor manifestation.	0.6499119422241246
In 27 cases, PET served as a screening procedure (group B).	0.6840002394252421
Statistic evaluation included sensitivity, specifity, positive/negative predictive value and accuracy of 18FDG-PET for the detection of tumor manifestation.	0.5119135022644515
Results: 18FDG-PET correctly identified 23 of 26 tumor sites (88%) in the re-staging group and 9 of 10 tumor sites (90%) in the screening group.	0.7316113577257284
We encountered a total number of 16 false-positive foci with an increased 18FDG-uptake.	0.5447396860506207
In six patients, 18FDG-PET detected tumor recurrence several months before a morphological correlative could be identified.	0.4678924710223034
In 5 of these 6 patients, the PET findings for the latter tumor sites determined the patient's fate.	0.6699258608021017
Specificity was 63% for local recurrence, 97% for secondary lymph node involvement and 90% for distant metastasis.	0.8220848952892397
Conclusion: According to these data, 18FDG-PET is the most effective diagnostic tool in the follow-up of oral cancer patients to date.	0.7913040599566533
Due to the high prevalence of recurrent disease in the follow-up of oral cancer, either the detection of early recurrence or the identification of additional, incurable tumors may add substantially to a rational therapeutic management.	0.7399124290635144
We therefore recommend 18FDG-PET for screening and re-staging of recurrent oral cancer.	0.5076184686577945
In over 80 % of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, the Nissen antireflux fundoplication gives good long-term results.	0.6994475205706406
Dysphagia, inability to belch or vomit as well as the gas bloat syndrome are possible sequelae after fundoplication.	0.41312823718759734
The frequency of these symptoms could be reduced by modification of the original Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication into the so-called "floppy" Nissen fundoplication, a short and loose wrap of mobilized gastric fundus.	0.6445916284003431
Failures of the antireflux procedure are mainly due to disruption or displacement of the wrap with the telescope phenomenon.	0.35719776788047447
Here, reoperation with refashioning of the original wrap may lead to same functional results like a primary fundoplication.	0.4694943885309929
Technical alternatives may selectively be chosen, when gastroesophageal reflux disease is complicated by fixated hiatal hernia, esophageal shortening, or serious esophageal motility disorders.	0.47386682888143494
Such specific anatomic or functional abnormalities are detected by preoperative endoscopy, barium swallow, 24-h pH monitoring, and manometry.	0.5546276641851976
Alternative techniques are mainly transthoracic repairs, including the Nissen fundoplication, Collis gastroplasty, and the Belsey Mark IV.	0.6555238183108588
Modifications of the 360  ° Nissen operation are partial fundoplications like the Hill repair and the Toupet dorsal fundoplication.	0.35065564095492807
Because of a high failure rate in the long-term follow-up, application of the ligamentum teres cardiopexy and of the Angelchik prosthesis is not recommended.	0.6869016744757972
We report a sporadic case of giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) starting in a 5-year-old boy with gait disturbance.	0.6714848963195654
At the age of 10 years he showed signs of a sensomotoric polyneuropathy and central neurological symptoms: intention tremor, nystagmus and visual disturbance.	0.4958495262519726
The boy also had curly hair.	0.22407784920275184
Sural nerve biopsy showed many giant axons with accumulation of microfilaments, which were also found in cytoplasma of Schwann cells, endothelial cells and fibrocytes.	0.6390673994315892
Similar changes were detected in endothelial cells of a muscle biopsy, which additionally displayed neurogenic atrophy and target fibers.	0.604994858048098
Immunohistochemically, desmin, vimentin, heat shock protein 70, and ubiquitin were not detectable in giant axons, which, however, contained neurofilament protein 68, 200 and  -tubulin.	0.6262608546739488
Our case shows that careful ultrastructural examination of a muscle biopsy may point to the diagnosis of GAN.	0.57384924931238
The endoscopic release of the carpal ligament gives the opportunity to treat the carpal tunnel syndrome in a comfortable and minimal invasive way.	0.49686568057062
Between 1 October 1994 and 7 May 1995, 46 patients who underwent endoscopic surgery on 55 hands were documented in a prospective study.	0.6885163726048055
The following results were taken from a questionnaire.	0.5291626521389602
There were not any complaints, or the complaints were so much diminished that complete division of the carpal ligament could be viewed as accomplished in 51 of 55 cases.	0.5776593839122918
There were continuing complaints in four cases, and after an additional check two patients were operated on again.	0.7766437229587614
The advantage of the endoscopic method is the inconspicuous scar and the reduced postoperative disablement.	0.5577966598331591
For surgical removal of a malignant choroid melanoma, it is necessary to reduce systolic blood pressure to around 50-60 mmHg in order to prevent choroidal haemorrhages.	0.7356068452337636
However, blood pressure reduction is associated with the risk of cerebral ischaemia.	0.7580926178330334
We report a patient with a malignant choroid melanoma in whom waves I and II of the brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) disappeared during surgery under controlled arterial hypotension and hypothermia (31.1 ° C).	0.6048397837085416
The waves could be recorded again immediately after the mean arterial pressure was increased from 48 to 77 mmHg.	0.5406937976151766
The oesophageal temperature had dropped by 0.3 ° C at this time.	0.527388092736778
The 2-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no irregularities during this time period.	0.6500056174502566
A bilateral, reversible, apparently blood-pressure-dependent loss of waves I and II during arterial hypotension despite a normal EEG has to our knowledge not been previously described in the literature.	0.5514335746544655
The isolated loss of waves I and II with maintenance of waves III, IV, and V is unusual.	0.5928474953895543
The literature contains reports of acoustic neurinoma patients in whom only wave V could be recorded.	0.5631301315649231
This is regarded as an indication of continued impulse conduction despite the loss of waves I to IV.	0.5178263778110337
Others have observed a patient with temporary and reversible loss of BAEP wave I due to vasospasm of the internal auditory artery that apparently occurred during or shortly after manipulation of the internal auditory meatus.	0.5358582026935524
Assuming anatomic peculiarities in the blood supply to the generators of the BAEP waves, a stenosis of the basilar artery could be considered as the cause of the bilateral reversible loss of waves I and II.	0.6633155004384148
Another potential source could be the induced hypothermia, but this does not seem very likely because the patient's temperature was 0.3 ° C lower at the return of the waves than at their loss.	0.7663441525502704
In the syndrome arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy, little is known to date about the mechanism for the development of arrhythmias.	0.5284330035864453
In a group of 54 patients with documented ventricular tachycardia during longterm ECG recordings, the determinants for the development of VT and the relationship between signal-averaged ECG and the morphological characteristics of the disease are investigated.	0.7093924807181143
The analysis of the long-term electrocardiographic data includes the measurement of RR-intervals 30, 15, 5, 1min and immediately before onset of the VT, the determination of the morphology of the previous ventricular premature beats, and the frequency of the atrial arrhythmias.	0.7669522308970117
Normal values for the analysis of late potentials in the ECG signal accquisition with bidirectional filters between 40 and 300Hz were defined a maximum of 113ms for a QRS width, LAS of 38ms, and RMS40 of 16uV.	0.5415519173223724
The analysis of the long-term ECG produced monomorphic VT in all cases without previous atrial arrhythmia and in only 4 cases with previous polymorphic ventricular premature beats.	0.618111499701546
A long-short phenomenon could only be proven in 4VT episodes.	0.5566640861491347
In 84% of all tachycardias, no arrhythmia were found immediately before onset of the arrhythmic event.	0.6917878493228258
According to the circadian clock, two peaks, mornings between 6 and 9h and evenings between 6 and 9h, could be determined.	0.5776871971514603
In patients, who were recently diagnosed with ARVD, a significant shortening of the RR intervals before the onset of VT as an indication of an acceleration of the sinus rhythm was observed.	0.7518220485541937
This effect could not be observed in patients with a past medical history of AVRD.	0.7702359599228724
Late potentials were determined with a prevalence of 74% overall.	0.5667773472827504
Increasingly, late potentials were observed with morphologically diffuse forms of the ARVD.	0.6133014634411105
A correlation to the severity of spontaneous arrhythmias (ventricular, sustained or not sustained VT) could not be established.	0.5987622271594032
In comparison to the origin of VT in coronary heart disease, previous arrhythmias play a less important role in arrhymogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy.	0.5828606180610495
Most importantly, an intensified sympathetic tone before onset of VT and an increased prevalence of positive late potentials are observed.	0.5972697031377612
We present the case of a 54-year-old male patient with a Syme amputation of his left leg following diabetic gangrene of the foot.	0.5338025121963168
A  local infection of the stump was treated successfully with two  endoscopic debridements and lavage.	0.5342857107131836
Additionally, the patient received local antibiotics by the application of antibiotic collagenous fleece and antibiotic chains.	0.6691017133619725
This therapeutic management combined with early weight bearing led to a stable stump.	0.4785223338136804
We describe an eighteen-months-old boy, who suffered from congenital vitium cordis, jejunalatresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphies and psychomotor retardation in connection with a partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.	0.47829756441794163
In most cases the genesis of brachial plexus palsy is traumatic, often because of bike accidents.	0.6333647524832501
If physiotherapy and neurosurgical procedures such as nerve repair do not have the desired outcome, muscle transfer operations are possible.	0.5275415246094289
The results of our favored transfer of the trapezius muscle to compensate paralysis of the deltoid muscle will be presented.	0.6028650673316691
Preoperatively radiological, clinical and electromyographic examinations are necessary.	0.5706976175081899
Our results are based upon the clinical and radiological check ups and the subjective assessment of the patients.	0.8398826352225485
Thirty-one patients (7 female, 24 male) underwent a trapezius transfer between March 1994 and December 1996.	0.7350152986805832
The average age was 29 years (range 18-46 years).	0.7367900314766079
We performed the operations using a modification of Saha's technique.	0.3684068237758218
With the patient in lateral decubitus position and protection of the opposite plexus, a sagital skin incision is the first step, followed by the preparation of trapezius and deltoid muscle as well as the bony parts of the shoulder (acromion, clavicle, scapular spine).	0.7084742883975303
The deltoid origin is cut from the lateral third of the clavicle, the acromion and the lateral half of the scapular spine.	0.6367483662840578
The next step is transection of the root of the acromion and the lateral clavicle.	0.578550074718125
After elevation of the remaining trapezius insertions from the clavicle and scapular spine, the proximal humerus is exposured by splitting the partly detached deltoid muscle longitudinally.	0.5368740699489388
Then the acromion fragment and humerus are prepared for the bone-to-bone contact.	0.5210290638058865
In 90  ° of abduction the acromion fragment with its trapezius insertion is transferred and fixed to the humerus with two 4.5-mm screws.	0.6667647116809462
Finally the deltoid is sutured on the top of the trapezius and the skin is closed over two suction drains.	0.5124564134350164
Postoperatively we immobilize the operated arm in an abduction support for 6 weeks.	0.36583266430637407
The physiotherapy program starts on the first postoperative day with active training of elbow, hand and fingers and electrostimulation of the transferred trapezius muscle.	0.4902479514007502
Six weeks after the procedure we take an X-ray and start with progressive adduction of the arm.	0.7113913231606809
The preoperative subluxation of the humeral head was abolished in all cases.	0.4850956341956908
We achieved an average increase of active abduction from 7.3  ° (range 0-45  °) preoperatively to 39.2  ° (range 25  °-80  °) 1 year after the operation; the increase of forward flexion was from 20  ° (range 0  °-85  °) to 43  ° (range 20  °-90  °).	0.8720223397101968
All patients were satisfied with the improvement of stability and function of the operated shoulder.	0.7595588123245095
Finally we can conclude that the trapezius transfer for flail shoulder gives a satisfactory outcome regarding shoulder function and stability as well as the subjective situation of the patients.	0.5695846006957928
We analyzed psychiatric and criminological data from 103 arsonists.	0.2803623922548447
The following criticisms of the definition of pyromania according to DSM-III-R and IDC-10 seem appropriate.	0.44137363653819456
First, the categoric exclusion of aggressive motives does not seem very promising, since approximately one fourth of arsonists whose firesetting is based on motives quoted in DSM-III-R may also have an aggressive motive.	0.5622261389467659
Second, ICD-10 gives being drunk and alcoholism as a criterion for the exclusion of pyromania.	0.3736759878786838
This seems untenable, since the behavior classed as pyromania is largely a product of alcohol misuse.	0.484919140677704
Repeated firesetting, resulting from being fascinated by fire etc., may be less a disturbance of impulse control but rather the manifestation of a psychoinfantilism, which, supported by alcohol abuse, extends into older age.	0.6052605193799239
The mean age of such arsonists is slightly above 20 years.	0.49361237188708257
The tendency for relapses after imprisonment seems to be low; this tendency probably decreases spontaneously in older age.	0.5106897762785904
The mean age of arsonists with aggressive motives is a little below 30 years, those setting fire with suicidal motives have a mean age of 35, deluded arsonists have a mean age of 40 years.	0.6166242735443349
Concrete sexual motives are relatively rare.	0.27031603607104043
Approximately 50 % of arsonists have a purely aggressive motive.	0.5915438980505298
Retaliation is a rare cause, however, since most of them do not even know the victims.	0.7198831090762268
One third of these persons set the fire in their own homes.	0.49960644742217547
Most arsonists show a personality disorder, with insecurity and narcissism predominating.	0.5101284841529081
Data on firesetting are to be treated with caution, since two thirds of all cases are newer resolved; one fourth of cases concern minors, and in Central Europe arsonists with rational motives are hardly ever referred to psychiatrists.	0.7238373484558289
A normal ciliary beat frequency of ciliated cells is necessary for the mucociliary clearance of the nose and paranasal sinuses.	0.48060337082006926
An in vitro investigation was performed to eval-uate the influence of topical corticosteroids and antihistamines on the ciliary beat frequency of human nasal mucosa.	0.5913598843400059
The nasal sprays examined contained the corticosteroids budesonide or fluticasone propionate and the topical antihistamines azelastine or levocabastine.	0.28166760032964155
All tests were performed on cell cultures of human nasal mucosa during constant conditions.	0.48684466392411835
Three of the four nasal sprays tested contained benzalkonium chloride as preservative.	0.4246314102555243
An irreversible cessation of ciliary movement was observed in all cells exposed to nasal sprays containing benzalkonium chloride in a 50 per cent solution.	0.49537486354031196
The nasal spray containing budesonide was benzalkonium chloride-free and caused minor but fully reversible decreases in ciliary beat frequency after 20 min.	0.40038511975448815
As benzalkonium chloride can cause complete standstill of ciliary beat frequency in vitro in human nasal mucosa, we recommend that this preservative should not be used anymore in topical nasal medications.	0.596655661154818
The treatment of patients with severe burn injuries is expensive and belongs in the hands of specialized burn centres.	0.6212806720270844
In our burn centre 257 patients were treated from 1991 to June 1995 (between 50 and 60 patients per year except for 1993 with 77 patients).	0.5593783661347991
Patients were evaluated according to the ABSI score (mean 7) and had mortality of around 15%.	0.8234794055875433
The costs range between 3.7 and 4.8 million DM per year, the profit lies in the same range.	0.8239494302101814
The costs are divided into staff costs (1.4 - 1.8 million DM per year), costs for medical treatment (1.5 - 1.9 million DM per year) and costs for internal services (600 000 - 900 000 DM per year) such as laboratory examinations (247 000 - 386 000 DM per year) and blood bank (100 000 - 215 000 DM per year), the main factors in this category.	0.7801612122269261
The different fields of costs and profit are compared in this analysis.	0.4356696288030939
Possible ways of reducing costs are pointed out, and the question of effectiveness of therapy is discussed.	0.7646571579653656
Conclusions from this analysis are limited by the individuality of each case with different clinical courses, the great number of influencing factors and the comparably small numbers of patients.	0.6229626315730256
In benign laryngotracheal stenosis the amount of respiratory deterioration rather than the crude morphologic appearance will determine whether or not surgical measures such as dilatation or resection should be applied.	0.4378833805438812
This review focusses on currently available and newly developed diagnostic tools to assess the functional importance of central airway obstruction.	0.44362808673413606
After an outline of upper airway physiology is formulated, spirometric measurements at rest are collected.	0.3948917651019752
Among these, Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEF) proved to be the simplest and most reliable parameter to monitor an obstructing lesion of the upper airways.	0.6666155678799142
A novel technique for fibrobronchoscopic assessment of glottic and tracheal resistance is presented in detail.	0.411499606221756
In contrast to usual tests of total airflow resistance which cannot distinguish between central and peripheral contributions, this test identifies the pressure-flow-relationship created exclusively by the local lesion.	0.5314494223688095
In serial stenoses, it indicates which is of higher clinical impact.	0.6212687639239467
Patients with upper airway obstruction complain of impaired exercise capacity.	0.37653569441953993
They tend to hypoventilate with imminent respiratory muscle fatigue.	0.2802173973667001
Therefore, spiroergometry may play a role in defining the point of incomplete compensation of a central load.	0.5753271212773643
The decision to operate will depend upon up the degree of physical capacity required to compensate for the stenosis.	0.5372478266975909
Stroke units are hospital-based special wards aiming at optimal care by a specialized team with an integrated concept for patients with acute strokes.	0.5583513129925747
Following the initial neurolo-gical and neuroradiological evaluation, early treatment will be initiated based on the assumed pathophysiology of the stroke.	0.5341536922564295
Acute management includes monitoring of physiological, parameters, care by specialized nurses, and early implementation of physiotherapists, speech therapy and occupational therapy.	0.5246026336362023
Despite the increased initial costs, the long-term burden for the health system is decreased by shorter hospital stay and reduced morbidity and disability.	0.5977382003346968
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the most important side-effect of heparin therapy.	0.8528302017911535
Two types of thrombocytopenia can be caused by heparin: a frequent non-immunologic type causing a minor decrease in thrombocyte count without apparent clinical importance and, on the other hand, an immunologic type accompanied by thromboembolic complications.	0.5191038676448565
Patients and methods: We report on two cases with HIT type II after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).	0.6635188665364125
HIT antibodies were demonstrated by ELISA for platelet-factor-4-heparin-complex and heparin-induced platelet-activation (HIPA) assay.	0.524140518887741
Results: A 67 year old patient suffered from a HIT type II seven days after administration of heparin during myocardial revascularization.	0.6224831799125358
In this patient, a continuous fever and a signicantly reduced general condition were the primary symptoms.	0.6935758490190104
The clinical picture of this disease was reversible after aborting the heparin therapy.	0.6792327259351102
Thromboembolic complications did not occur.	0.17070337514081513
A 70 year old patient developed a HIT type II with thromboembolic complications 13 days after CABG.	0.6624704800009991
The vascular occlusions affected the A. spinalis anterior with the development of a spinalis anterior-syndrome, the coronary arteries with the development of myocadial infarction, and the A. iliaca interna.	0.7064926555877914
A white-clot syndrome with thrombi in the ascending aorta, in the left atrium, and in the left ventricle required an operation with extracorporal circulation including the use of recombinant hirudin for anticoagulation.	0.8245874729154392
Conclusion: With therapy with heparin, it is obligatory to check platelet count.	0.6052447543178344
An indication for the development of HIT type II is a decrease in platelet count or thromboembolic complications during heparin therapy.	0.5514535439658943
In the case of HIT type II recombinant hirudin was a practical altenative as an anticoagulant for extracorporal circulation and for continous hemofiltration.	0.44473042703464166
Oxygen radicals and oxygen radial mediators are thought to be important components in the development of acute lung injury, sepsis, and multiple organ failure.	0.6255439484356854
Injured patients, patients with pulmonary diseases, and multiple trauma patients also showed an elevated lipid peroxidation, indicating increased oxidant stress.	0.8172271686796742
N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has been used as an antioxidant in a wide variety of experiments.	0.6869753701957952
NAC has been suggested to act by raising concentrations of cysteine, and hence glutathione, and by scavenging of oxidant species [1, 11, 17, 29].	0.7350552558648034
The present study was designed to investigate whether the application of NAC in intubated patients has an effect on concentrations of reduced glutathione in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and on the lipid peroxidation products malondialdehyde and conjugated dienes.	0.5754196106213987
Because NAC has been widely used as a mucolytic drug for the treatment of lung diseases, the influence on tracheobronchial mucus was studied, too.	0.6379473084089547
Between 1990 and 1995, 27 patients with posttraumatic disorders of the subtalar joint were treated by correcting fusion.	0.7652170905477919
Preoperatively 24 patients (88.89 %) suffered from pain; 15 (55.56 %) had a walking range below 100 m. Seven patients were unable to work in their original profession.	0.7209671718121381
After an average period of 13.85 months postoperatively the patients were examined again.	0.7850101125967437
At this time 18 (66.67 %) had no or minimal pain; 19 (70.37 %) had no claudication.	0.815125069848927
According to the score of Angus and Skuginna, in 81.48 % of patients the result of the correcting arthrodesis was successful; according to Kitaoka's clinical rating system for ankle-hindfoot, midfoot, hallux and lesser toes, the average postoperative score was 75.8 points.	0.7197994680205774
Objective: To examine changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) in children in the last twenty years and to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity.	0.8023781055933463
The review of medication has been recommended as an important part in preventing falls.	0.6885657016790105
In a random sample of 276 hospital in-patients aged 75 and over, the frequency of prescribed drugs which may increase the risk of falling by causing dizziness was assessed.	0.5079843431820792
Questions about dizziness and previous falls were included in a standardized questionnaire.	0.5029077752871282
Migration of an impacted mandibular premolar is a rare finding, whereas dystopia of lower jaw cuspids is described much more often in the literature.	0.6766383919450556
We present a patient in whom radiographic studies show the migration of a mandibular premolar to the muscular process over a period of 14 years.	0.551681808288337
Most of the tooth migration along the vertical portion of the mandibula into the processus muscularis took place after the root development had ended.	0.4194688005509626
Neither radiological nor clinical examination revealed the stimulus which changed the path and the direction of the impacted tooth.	0.4676443561206315
In atopic eczema patients the well-known abnormal cutaneous reactivity of the blood vessels (white dermographism, delayed blanch after acetylcholine, paradoxical blanching after nicotinic acid application and diminished erythema after histamine injection) were observed during acute eczematous episodes and later in an eczema-free state in comparison with controls.	0.5877436487033473
In this follow-up study the use of different stimuli allowed us to demonstrate abnormal cutaneous vascular reactions in the patients depending on the severity of their atopic eczema.	0.6500520050310106
Severely affected patients showed persistence of the paradoxical vascular reactions even in an eczema-free cutaneous state.	0.3750574040090708
We report on a 9-year-old girl with a giant cell fibroblastoma of the right anterior chest wall.	0.7105180568785204
This rare soft tissue tumour occurs predominantly in the first two decades of life.	0.7148768375656501
The typical clinical presentation is a solitary, usually 2-6 cm large, non-tender mass of blue-greyish colour which is mostly located on the back, anterior chest wall, thigh or groin.	0.6433293655328787
The histology shows a loose infiltrate of predominantly bland spindle cells in dermis and subcutis.	0.34282644504291854
Characteristic elements of the tumour are large angiectoid branching spaces lacking any endo- or epithelium, and relatively small multinucleated cells (floret cells).	0.565848960224303
The recurrence rate is high if the tumour is not excised with adequate safety margins.	0.47239684811913446
It is of pre-eminent importance to differentiate this rare benign tumor from sarcomas, in order to avoid an inappropriately aggressive therapy.	0.6677297275467052
To correct severe septal deformities, it is often necessary to perform an extracorporal septoplasty with temporary removal of the deviated septal cartilage, followed by straightening and reimplantation into the nose as free graft.	0.5834174387660167
The utilization of a compound graft, which sutures the cartilage fragments to a resorbable polydioxanon (PDS) foil, facilitates this technique immediately while simultaneously ensuring support of the nasal dorsum.	0.5041297961682442
Stress incontinence is the most frequent form of incontinence found in females.	0.6240085865598849
The usual method of surgery for this is to lift the bladder neck towards cranial and ventral.	0.4897567075340784
Two competitive techniques - bladder neck suspension in accordance with Stamey and colposuspension in accordance with Burch - were retrospectively investigated.	0.5811284070334275
A total of 95 women underwent surgery and it was possible to evaluate the postoperative course in 46 and 30 (total 76) patients respectively.	0.7552391819500656
Initially, both surgical techniques demonstrated a very good success rate (91.3 % and 96.7 % resp.).	0.8256414566212958
However, the continence rate of the Stamey patients deteriorated after 6 weeks down to 78.3 % and after more than 2 years only 28.6 % of these patients were still completely continent (mean follow-up 40.4 mths), whereas deterioration in the Burch patients was only 87 % (mean follow-up 44.25 mths).	0.8382043998798363
The disappointing results with the Stamey technique did not correlate with the degree of initial continence.	0.48818031664048245
It was noted here that obese patients showed a greater tendency towards regression.	0.5658997853297048
The three cases of recurring incontinence after Burch colposuspension were already relapses at the time of surgery.	0.5419430393959984
With respect to long-term follow-up, our results with the Stamey method were distinctly poorer than with the Burch technique.	0.6200823995416154
Therefore, in our opinion, the Burch colposuspension procedure and fascioplasty should be the method of choice for the management of stress incontinence.	0.8210203931096961
This paper is concerned with the relationship between social inequality and psychiatric disorders, an issue being neglected in German psychiatry for a long time.	0.5700537055263771
Social inequality will be discussed in it's dimensions "socioeconomic status" and "sex" referring to the present state of epidemiological and sociological knowledge.	0.5896388625071893
Because such macrosocial factors offer little explanation for the association with psychiatric disorders by themselves microsocial concepts of burden and resources are necessary to link the structural and the individual level.	0.4809631762688735
These concepts are considered to be one pathway by which the mechanisms to disease may occur.	0.5474232277403548
A short review of empirical findings and analytic approaches show the complexity of these mechanisms requiering further research not only because of analytic deficiences but also because of social change.	0.43832449087142805
Further research will concern in general the explanation of social patterns of diseases, in detail the link between individual stress and coping with the social structure, and last but not least a gender-sensitive approach to psychiatric disorders which is more differenciated.	0.6302666595332879
It is well known that alterations to the oral cavity caused by dental prostheses may affect speech articulation, although influences on the voice are not assumed.	0.5874080184538524
In addition to the vocal fundamental frequency, vibrations of the vocal chords generate overtones.	0.5463267475435377
Through the shape of the larynx and the upper airway, resonances and antiresonances are formed, and in this way overtones are amplified to a variable extent.	0.7531232902609548
Nozzle changes caused by a dental prosthesis in the oral cavity may possibly influence overtones but influences on the vocal fundamental frequency seem unlikely.	0.46901394650397243
The influence of dental prostheses on the voice is demonstrated in a patient who owned two different dental prostheses.	0.7015175827714091
The fundamental frequency rose by up to five semitones during speech and his vocal range increased by up to four semitones when a thin denture was used instead of a normal denture.	0.45302898126771196
When the position of the mandible was checked by intraoral needle point placement, a more rostral position of the mandible was recorded with the thin denture than with the normal denture.	0.7220563293964676
Sagittal magnetic resonance tomography imaging also showed that the larynx was in a more cranial position.	0.5985499746892732
This change was presumed to be due to an upward movement of the larynx induced by the tongue, which itself was found to be in a more cranial position with the thin denture.	0.7218168489484799
In this situation, increased tension of the laryngeal muscles were believed to induce a rise in fundamental frequency, shifting the voice range toward higher frequencies.	0.5707128998598407
These findings show that dental prostheses can cause vocal changes in individual cases.	0.4067088598467656
The etiology of this occurrence is still not clear.	0.6459156156956614
Its consequences, however, should be known to the dentist, ENT surgeon and phoniatrist if patients notice changes in their voice after having altered or replaced their dentures.	0.4224457551444955
Cytokine blood levels are found to be moderately elevated in chronic heart failure, as a function of severity of disease.	0.699039642406212
The source of these cytokines and the trigger mechanisms stimulating cytokine release are a matter of intense research.	0.4434851394981843
Potential players include bacterial endotoxin from intestinal translocation, a neurohumoral dysbalance with an enhanced sympathetic tone or an overspill of cytoines from the failing heart itself.	0.37664270603433925
We present arguments in favor of a direct link between the chronically enhanced sympathetic tone in heart failure and the clinically over activation of the immune system, particularly interleukin 6 release.	0.6535189653899698
Objectives: This 1998 survey was carried out on the use of the sitting position for neurosurgical procedures in the posterior fossa and operations of the craniospinal and cervical spine region by the dorsal approach.	0.6113881518854632
In addition, anesthetic management of the sitting position and the compliance with recommendations of the Neuroanesthesia Study Group of the German Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI) published in 1995 were investigated and compared to results of a 1995 survey.	0.6569537529888749
Polar body analysis is a perfect tool to exclude genetically altered oocytes prior to fertilisation.	0.35426418946950855
This helps to improve pregnancy rates and baby take home rates in assisted reproduction, primarily in advanced maternal age patients.	0.40290750379548274
This might reduce the need of invasive prenatal diagnosis for those patients.	0.5988151296261962
Polar body analysis offers treatment in reproductive medicine for female patients carrying a chromosomal aberration or a mutation before they become pregnant.	0.3583021683726838
However, it does not assess the genetic status of the embryo resulting from the oocyte tested and selected.	0.6861523740792149
The paternal contribution to the embryo is left unattended.	0.33605155508679846
Ethical considerations do not play a role, since no manipulation or selection is performed on embryos.	0.5580903552251462
Pachydermoperiostosis (Friedreich-Erb-Arnold syndrome, Touraine-Solente-Golé syndrome) is a rare disease with an autosomal dominant mode of unheritance; it occurs almost exclusively in men.	0.58838081053556
A report of typical pachydermoperiostosis in a 31-year-old man is presented.	0.5477442216227849
Associated features were clubbed digits of the hands and feet with watch-crystal nails, thickening of the skin and soft tissues, hyperhidrosis of hands and feet, hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands with seborrhoea, gynaecomastia, and ophthalmic abnormalities that had been present since puberty.	0.520607639824542
Radiological examination revealed periosteal hyperostosis of the short and long bones.	0.45496200340958737
Endocrine disturbances were not detected.	0.2340911477090668
Skin biopsies showed hypertrophy of the skin and skin appendages.	0.6607135248112649
Primary (idiopathic, hereditary) pachydermoperiostosis should be distinguished from secondary (symptomatic) forms of the disease, which are often associated with lung tumours.	0.6573535251316187
The following review will examine the outcome of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatment studies of anorexia and bulimia nervosa.	0.534759790485461
For both eating disorders, psychotherapy is the treatment of choice.	0.5173376274086601
In clinical practice "treatment packages" are offered to account for the complexity of the disorders.	0.6071720674881831
In bulimia nervosa, cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques have dominated the literature and appear to be successful.	0.5591433594532692
Newer studies reporting on the use of interpersonal therapy also find considerable improvement of symptoms.	0.28469252423431124
Antidepressive medication can be useful in the treatment of bulimia nervosa.	0.5408659303933139
Recently, a stepped care approach to treatment has been recommended, with self-care manuals as the first step.	0.8069205486513886
In anorexia nervosa there is a paucity of controlled clinical trials.	0.4232749033858558
Contingency management for weight restoration can be viewed as a necessary element in all in- and outpatient treatments.	0.5760618158331067
Family therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and psychodynamic approaches have proven useful in clinical practice; however, only a limited data base exists regarding the efficacy of these therapies.	0.6882785022402089
Medication should not be used routinely in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.	0.6039208588408034
Absorption of irrigating fluid in transurethral prostatic resection (TURP) and percutaneous nephrolitholapaxy (PNL) into veins or delayed absorption due to fluid extravasation may result in a TURP syndrome.	0.49051605184837516
The measurement of end-tidal breath alcohol concentration (et AC) as a monitor of absorption of irrigating fluid labelled with 2% ethanol is limited by the disturbance of infrared sensors by volatile anaesthetics and nitrous oxide (N2O) (Fig.	0.6092009038486202
An electrochemical sensor is acceptable for this method.	0.3167066796959417
The aim of the present study was the evaluation of breath alcohol measurements using an electrochemical sensor device (Alcomed 3010, Envitec).	0.5698580411842089
The stability of the sensor in the presence of volatile anaesthetics was examined using a lung model.	0.407252586400223
In a clinical investigation, the device was then applied to spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated patients inhaling volatile anaesthetics during endoscopic urological surgery.	0.527011122264938
Skin diseases, the psyche and psychological changes are often intertwined, especially in patients presenting for expert dermatologic opinion.	0.7045093888767779
In many cases an additional evaluation provided by psychotherapeutic medicine may be necessary.	0.5351790514160536
This resource may help with the diagnosis, explanation of the problem and estimation of the degree of disability.	0.6539545492264102
The different legal guidelines of the various evaluation boards must be considered.	0.5517402926318405
The role of psychotherapeutic evaluation is demonstrated through case examples.	0.348054430529779
The evaluation of new possibly occupationally-related disorders such as multiple chemical sensitivity and mobbing is considered.	0.4224175643924049
We investigated the impact of old age on the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation.	0.4736101816500503
32 depressive inpatients were assessed before and after sleep deprivation by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.	0.3767521747461039
The patients were divided into two groups according to their age.	0.7545040249181322
The result showed no negative impact of old age on the anti-depressant effect of sleep deprivation.	0.4273628318227585
During MRI-controlled resection of brain tumors using an open MRI system, operation-induced alterations may occur, especially enhancement of the resection cavity wall.	0.6618445897532609
This may simulate tumor areas, resulting in false assessment of the resection or resection of non-tumorous areas.	0.5410128503515451
Based on 42 MRI- and biopsy-controlled brain tumor resections in an 0.5 T open MRI (Signa SP, GE), the appearance and origin of operation-induced reactions are analyzed.	0.6143909255936396
In our opinion, there is a superposition of preformed peritumoral reactions by operation-induced microcontusions.	0.5311894019817127
The beginning of the cavity wall enhancement needs at least 10-15 min.	0.5453020114767116
MRI-controlled analysis of the intraoperative steps by the neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist allows discrimination of operation-induced reactions from tumor areas and leads to safe operation.	0.5015454351914825
Angiosarcomas are very rare but highly malignant soft tissue tumors derived from the vascular endothelium.	0.6208177192945272

Background: Lipoprotein (a) is an important codominantly inherited risk factor for coronary disease but there is little data about its distribution in childhood.	0.6985874704156796
Despite the important role of lymph node infiltration for the classification and prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), no standards exist to evaluate the quality of mediastinal lymphadenectomy.	0.6918877441450776
Researches at several centers are not convinced that complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy is necessary.	0.3138052337389538
We investigated 270 consecutive patients undergoing a potential curative operation for NSCLC including complete ipsilateral lymph node dissection in order to ascertain whether or not there is a correlation between tumor localization and lymph node infiltration.	0.6134967186733561
Patients were classified into the UICC (1987) stages I (n = 115), II (n = 42), and IIIa (n = 113).	0.6011279148581312
In patients with N1-positive lymph nodes (n = 61) we found higher 5-year survival for patients with only intrapulmonary lymph node infiltration (39 %) than for patients with hilar infiltration (21 %).	0.733333894037516
Patients with N2 disease showed skip metastases in up to 81 % of cases.	0.6003178480206364
We found that no tumor location predicted the lymph node infiltration.	0.5873700936692758
Due to the variability of lymph node infiltration and the frequently occurring skip metastases, complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy should be the standard for curative operations for NSCLC.	0.6923490731337
The muscles should be viewed as a response member in functional and structural disorders as well as in central control.	0.5732565949958548
This second part of the article will attempt to show not only that the muscles are representing an interesting and sensitive information pool for disorders in the motoric system, but also that lesions in specific leg and hip muscles have an effect on the pelvis and spine and even on scapular mobility.	0.6013580538269417
Purpose: The aim of the study was to apply laparoscopic techniques in reconstructive procedures for aortoiliac occlusive disease.	0.590128361741543
Methods: From February 1996 to February 1998, 16 patients underwent a laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass procedure (ABF) using the transperitoneal approach.	0.7276395222079066
Six, 5 to 12 mm ports were needed to dissect, cross-clamp and divide the infrarenal aorta using specific laparoscopic devices.	0.4448092041325014
The aortic anastomosis was made end-to-side.	0.5508546319159344
A long curved clamp was then passed from each groin to draw the limbs of the graft into the femoral incision.	0.5019078859712667
The distal anastomosis was then performed conventionally.	0.33550009017255283
Results: The laparoscopic ABF was performed successfully in 13 of 16 cases.	0.6431943944679653
Three times a conversion to open surgery was requested.	0.5261351532568719
One patient developed respiratory insufficiency requiring prolonged treatment on the ICU.	0.5259267760076768
Mean operative time was 292 +/- 60 min; the aorta was crossclamped for 74 +/- 18 min.	0.6202629551571196
Two patients needed transfusions of red blood cells.	0.4535384102938978
In the study group, blood loss averaged 566 +/- 434 ml.	0.6594422713789186
The bypass patency and the correct positioning of the graft were assessed by angiography.	0.581519698607777
The patients were discharged 9 +/- 5.8 days after surgery.	0.8091533857745496
At follow-up after 4.5 +/- 4 months, 15 patients were examined noninvasively in the vascular laboratory.	0.8726763074222886
All grafts were patent, and the ischemic symptoms had resolved in 14 patients.	0.6104672663063917
One patient with recurrent claudication had severe stenosis of the left distal anastomosis.	0.6984030830890016
Conclusions: The laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass is a feasible, safe and effective procedure.	0.6494127680000111
Specific laparoscopic instruments are required for the challenging procedure.	0.42902365615428295
The development of vascular staplers and retraction devices will probably reduce the operative time and the technical challenge.	0.4566718792188775
In the future this operative technique may gain relevance as a minimally invasive procedure for severe aortoiliac occlusive disease.	0.587499583892811

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of dermatophytes was established.	0.40580128403028004
The primers "TR1" and "TR2" amplify a 581 bp fragment within the gene coding for the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.	0.5143332661033897
PCR allowed the detection of isolates of 7 common dermatophytes and in addition several yeasts and moulds.	0.4010761016403399
Hybridisation with specific oligonucleotides results in the identification of dermatophytes and Candida albicans.	0.46832600932779483
Restriction analysis of the PCR product allowed us to distinguish between dermatophytes and yeasts or moulds.	0.5355375062425215
The specifity of the PCR with respect to fungi was assessed by testing human DNA collected from 42 dermis and epidermis specimens as well as DNA from selected plants and animals.	0.5054133227439109
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the PCR assay, 69 routinely collected skin and nail specimens were examined by PCR and culture.	0.688838177060837
PCR detected dermatophytes in 35 and culture in 28 of 38 specimens that were classified as positive.	0.4206859940827817
Sensitivity of PCR (92%) was higher than that of culture (73%).	0.6537058838368753
These results show that PCR has advantages over culture for the detection of dermatophytes.	0.42972153522481027
Starting with the recommendations of the "Psychiatrie-Enquête", a current empirical stock-taking was undertaken about the structure of care in psychiatric hospital units.	0.4940621554305866
319 treatment units (289 in Germany, 11 in Austria, and 19 in Switzerland) were investigated concerning size of the treatment unit, number of wards, centrality of admission, existence of large observation rooms ("Wachsäle"), spezialized wards, single sex wards, regionalization/sectorization, open-door wards, coercive measures, and intended structural changes.	0.6350094232315366
The return rate of questionnaires amounted 59%.	0.2985787568970795
The results show that the recommendations of the "Psychiatrie-Enquête" are mostly realized today, but not everywhere.	0.7027337690519964
Across countries differences resulted in size of ward, centrality of admission, open-door wards, and coercive measures.	0.43875802087275323
Treatment units in the western and eastern parts of germany differed in size of ward and centrality of admission.	0.4229152322459514
Differences between psychiatric hospitals, psychiatric departments at general hospitals and psychiatric university hospitals were, though significant, smaller than expected in the light of past controversies.	0.5234437932546567
Intended structural changes mainly concerned open-door wards, internal sectorization, decentralization of admission, and mixing the sexes in single sex wards.	0.43840569008139396

Background: Considering the high recurrence rate after conventional inguinal hernia repair, the totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair has been used.	0.5913118865879636
Methods: The present experience of the authors embraces 1085 patients with a total of 1717 inguinal hernias, including 200 recurrences.	0.7540079758114606
The operative technique is described with emphasis on pitfalls and tricks.	0.6302737411534077
Results: Analysis of the data concerning the first 403 patients with 1 year complete follow-up reveals a mean (SEM) operating time of 42 (1.2) min for unilateral and 58 (1.0) min for bilateral hernia repair.	0.8037048046435649
Mean (SEM) postoperative hospital stay was 2 (0.04) days.	0.5871601042589576
Complication rates during and after operation were 0.3 % and 3.3 % respectively.	0.901489566795308
The morbidity rate at 1 month after operation was 3.5 %.	0.7207839044502843
The recurrence rate was 0.3 % at 1-year follow-up.	0.8844317459170178
Conclusion: Totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair is safe and reproducible for any type of primary or recurrent inguinal hernia, even in patients with previous subumbilical surgery or severe systemic disease.	0.6455838186803166
Careful follow-up is mandatory to assess the late recurrence rate.	0.5862131426681092
Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively whether there are differences in spectrometrically measurable parameters of the fundus between patients with early and late age-related maculopathy (ARM), the children of the ARM patients (F1 generation) and normals.	0.7312979736341245
In approximately 4-10 % of patients presenting with renal cell cancer the transluminal propagation of a tumor thrombus into the vena cava inferior or the right atrium comes to diagnosis.	0.6830080560105785
Recent investigations have indicated that the presence of neoplastic extension into the venous system does not reveal independent prognostic value regarding the clinical course of the disease.	0.614289066282092
Although the complete surgical removal of vena cava thrombosis in patients without simultaneously occurring regional lymph node or distant metastases has become a well established treatment modality, several questions concerning this surgical strategy still remain the subject of ongoing discussions.	0.650898789514116
In the present investigation that included 92 patients with renal cell cancer and intracaval neoplastic extension it was clearly demonstrated that the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest preferably during the removal of intracaval thrombosis extending into the right atrium does not result in a substantially increased treatment-related intra- or postoperative mortality.	0.703449180469761
However, in contrast to a previously reported observation this treatment option did not reveal any substantial impact on the long-term survival of the patients following surgical therapy.	0.8705437808756171
Accordingly, the cranial extension of intracaval thrombosis was not identified as a biological variable of any prognostic importance for renal cell cancer patients.	0.613762533560259
Vascular surgery or penile prosthesis implantation are the main surgical options for erectile dysfunction.	0.5263174484832647
In this category, penile revascularization is the only causal therapy for selected patients: males younger than 50 years of age at time of surgery, maximum of two risk factors, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.	0.5963519855455959
Long-term success decreased to 53 % to 55 % in comparison to first encouraging reports of 80 % success.	0.9170531648267584
Venous surgery resulted in an even more distinct decline of success the longer the elapse of time after surgery.	0.45941579897415447
Long-term success dropped under 40 %, leaving only a few indications for penile venous ligation.	0.6739706177370299
In contrast, penile prosthesis implantation results in high satisfaction rates.	0.41830050476208663
Despite this, it is not generally recommended as first choice surgical management as it is linked to irreversible damage of the cavernosal bodies.	0.6725968008382819
Among numerous types of penile implants, preference is nowadays mostly given to the three-piece hydraulic models.	0.4673217124677218
However, such complications as defective or perforated cylinders in up to 35 % after 5 years have arisen, depending on the type of implant.	0.6953070114115085
In a selected patient group, vacuum constriction devices with a mean patient acceptance of 75 % (50 % to 90 %) seldom result in complications and are thus considered to be a well-established therapeutical option.	0.7448775608225234
It has been suggested that anhedonia, the loss of pleasure, is associated with a dysfunction of the dopaminergic reward system in schizophrenic and alcohol-dependent patients.	0.6350077455225672
In a series of neuroendocrinological and brain imaging studies, we examined pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms of dopaminergic neurotransmission in non-human primates and in schizophrenic and alcohol-dependent patients.	0.5418197820168116
Among alcoholics, we found indicators of a sensitization of dopaminergic neurotransmission, which was associated with the relapse risk, but not with anhedonia or depression.	0.8717078178284796
Schizophrenics with neuroleptic blockade of striatal dopamine D2 receptors displayed psychomotor slowing and reduced motivation, but not anhedonia.	0.5536956109928247
Primate studies pointed to the importance of a temporo-cortical dysfunction in the pathogenesis of phasic dopaminergic dysregulation in the striatum.	0.4036646636149983
These observations indicate that a dysfunction of stimulus-dependent dopamine release may be associated with motivational deficits caused by a reduction in incentive salience, but not with anhedonia.	0.6261456036615257
Any operation for lung cancer that is planned as curative includes dissection of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum in order to allow correct staging of the disease.	0.5904839191944297
It is well known that ipsilateral lymph node metastases (N2) mean a poor prognosis.	0.5053987678311412
Since most patients with this finding die from metastatic tumor progression within 3 years after the operation, it can be assumed that positive findings in the mediastinal lymph nodes represent generalization of the cancer.	0.7400664249217551
Therefore, the probability of a therapeutic effect from more radical removal of lymph nodes in the mediastinum is rather low.	0.6247888145308026
On the other hand, it is justified to apply and evaluate additional systemic treatment in these tumor stages.	0.5843014060398831
In analogy with high-dose contrast-enhanced CT, there have been a few studies during recent years that have dealt with high-dose paramagnetic contrast dyes in MRI.	0.7818127170798873
One reason for these studies was the development of new and low-osmolar contrast agents in the MR field.	0.6773182171494238
Depending on the clinical problem, a high-dose contrast study in MRI is rarely indicated: (1) in metastatic disease, MR imaging with high-dose contrast material is indicated when the standard dose study is negative or only shows a solitary cerebral lesion or a number of lesions just suitable for radiosurgery; (2) in patients with malignant glioma the high-dose study allows better definition of the tumor margins.	0.842117616676195
If a radical surgical approach is planned, the diagnostic potential should be fully used; if only a biopsy or subtotal debulking is planned, a standard dose study is enough.	0.6263288798187465
(3) in patients with MS, a high-dose study is only recommended within therapeutic trials in which the number of active plaques is a primary variable.	0.821761048646377
The basic idea of the Collaborative Family Health Care is nothing new.	0.38798122558909953

At a time of basic changes in our health care system caused by cost considerations owing to the cutting back of resources it is important to note, that Collaborative Family Health Care combines aspects of theoretical models and pragmatic action-orientation.	0.5359782216222014
The basic is a systemic view of illness and health.	0.482974073899284
The doctor-patient-dyad is in this view enlarged to a treatment-triad composed of the therapist, the patient and his family, to be able to bundle the whole potential at disposal, i.e.	0.6674296747335207
the treatment motivation of the patient, the support of the family and the expertize of the therapist.	0.7361394520231181
A lot of studies support the resource- saving potential of coopertive methods.	0.3769710980899782
However, their realization is not possible without considerable learning processes of physicians, psychotherapists and other  professionals.	0.6476839785689654
A potential has to be mobilized, which affects by no means only the costs.	0.5356195135957456
The Collaborative Family Health Care offers new challenges to the professional culture of psychotherapists and new chances for influencing the world of medical health care.	0.4315141869975673
At a time of obviously reduced professional solidarity, the iniitiatives of CFHC offer a possibility for physicians, patients and their relatives to reach contentment through cooperation.	0.6514861315872027
Interested colleagues are invited to collaborate in the German Section of the CFHC.	0.5042764661239467
We evaluated the short- to mid-term results of an unconstrained total ankle prosthesis (S. T. A. R.) with uncemented fixation.	0.8669055626367839
Fifty consecutive ankle replacements were performed in 48 patients between 1996 and 1999.	0.52840988462143
The initial diagnosis was posttraumatic osteoarthrosis in 31 cases (62 %), primary osteoarthrosis in 8 cases (16 %), and systemic joint affection in 11 cases (22 %), e. g. rheumatoid arthritis (6 cases), hemochromatosis (2 cases), psoriasis arthritis (1 case), lupus erythematodes (1 case), and sclerodermia (1 case).	0.7196129299366688
There were two perioperative complications: one superficial wound dehiscence that healed uneventfully, and one injury to the dorsal foot artery that necessitated primary reconstruction.	0.5792017847853148
Seven revisions, all in cases of posttraumatic arthrosis, were necessary: local revision of the fibula for painful lateral impingement (3 cases), posteromedial soft tissue revision for painful restriction of dorsiflexion (2 cases), percutaneous lengthening of the Achilles tendon (1 case), and osteotomy and callus distraction for angular correction after stress fracture of the distal tibia (1 case).	0.7064654583659364
At the last follow-up control, 21 patients (62 %) were very satisfied, 10 patients (29 %) were satisfied, and 3 patients (9 %) were satisfied with reservations.	0.9947145125297087
The obtained range of motion was 30  ° (range, 15 to 55  °), with a maximal plantarflexion of 25  ° (range, 15 to 45  °) and dorsiflexion of 5  ° (-3 to 20  °).	0.8792135765369182
When the AOFAS-Hindfoot-Score was applied, the 34 patients scored 84.1 points (range, 44 to 100 points).	0.5552303373410661
After settling of the implants within 6 weeks, no migration was noted in any case, and all implants were considered to be stable.	0.8038400218814236
The favorable results were considered to be a result of the mechanical properties of the S. T. A. R. total ankle prosthesis that allows for unconstrained motion of the polyethylene inlay on the tibial component, e. g. anteroposterior translation, mediolateral translation and axial rotation.	0.6197239050789706
The success of implantation may depend on exact technique, correct hindfoot alignement, sufficient capsuloligamentous stability of the ankle, and a solid bone stock.	0.79394987280197
Although our first results are very encouraging, a longer follow-up is mandatory to answer the question whether ankle replacement is a viable alternative to ankle arthrodesis.	0.586929407637237
In a prospective study, the influence of the status of the peri-implant hard and soft tissues on the success of enosseous dental implants in tumor patients was assessed.	0.701355640400646
Out of 59 tumor patients with 261 implants, treated between July 1988 and August 1996, a pool of 23 patients with 99 implants provided with dentures for at least 1 year was obtained.	0.5755220544696046
Eighteen of these patients suffered from a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.	0.743190376200957
Seventeen patients underwent preoperative radiation (40 Gy).	0.514104966659321
A total of 68 out of 99 implants were inserted into autologous bone transplanted to reconstruct the mandible.	0.48891553964658
In order to assess the peri-implant hard and soft tissues, the Hygiene Index, the Sulcus Bleeding Index, the Gingiva Index, the pocket-probing depth, the peri-implant bone resorption, and the periotest were used.	0.7038051033916435
The results in the tumor patients were compared with the results in a pool of nontumor patients.	1.1526053135341605
Tumor patients had significantly worse peri-implant parameters than nontumor patients.	0.3963112482992137
The peri-implant pocket-probing depth proved to have significant influence on the success rate.	0.6018626172610717
The overall success rate was 77.8%.	0.4373182029625107
Many articles in the literature document the fact that postoperative pain therapy has not improved for decades despite new insights into pain physiology, the availability of powerful analgesics and the development of new techniques.	0.6239328720293449

Ventral spondylodesis using an H-plate was performed.	0.31449916924395116
The patient developed a pharyngovertebral fistula which remained undetected for 1 year.	0.4894411402098251
Spontaneous fusion of C3/C4 and osteolysis of the cortical block occurred.	0.272393990706542
The fistula was demonstrated intraoperatively and the implant was transorally removed.	0.6011488617117883

An interscalene block of the brachial plexus was combined with general anaesthesia for repair of a complex chronic lesion of the shoulder.	0.6621679415689161
The localisation of the plexus with electro-stimulation and the injection of Bupivacain 0.5% were accomplished easily and without painful sensations.	0.6634311550817215
48 hours later the block was still partially present.	0.36706664136194334
Paraesthesia and a sensory and motor innervation deficit affected mainly the dorsal fascicle, but also areas innervated by the median and lateral fascicles.	0.5417711742869904
The deficit did not completely disappear for 18 month.	0.26392647331744473
The cause could have been due to direct traumatisation during blockade or operation, toxic action of the injected substance (Bupivacain 0,5%, 30 ml), distension of the plexus, a cervical syndrome or an aseptic plexitis, although a definite determination is not possible.	0.6709694055724853
However, the pattern of the lesion and the lack of pain during localisation of the plexus and injection favour traumatisation during the acromioplasty.	0.6666824541780585

Systematic investigations on nerve crossing date to the beginning of the nineteenth century and were conducted by Jean Pierre Flourens.	0.38228760810727713
Within 1 week in summer 1864, two French surgeons (Laugier and Nélaton) independently carried out the first nerve sutures in humans.	0.41530455625253493
Their observations of an immediate functional recovery of the appropriate muscles after suturing were discussed controversially in scientific circles.	0.42946443874278223
Purpose: To analyze the value of electrophysiologic testing according to standards of the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) in infants less than 10 years of age.	0.6797630288068041
Aggressive angiomyxoma (AAM) is a tumor of the soft tissues predominantely occurring in the genital and pelvic area with a strong propensity to local recurrences.	0.6147556932952839
The entity was first described in 1983.	0.37912572442773124
The tumor is regarded as low-grade sarcoma by some authors; its cause and pathogenesis are presently unknown.	0.5917075871075526
This is a case report on a 27-year-old man who underwent 4 surgical procedures of the left lower extremity because of a recurrent soft tissue neoplasm, initially (August 1993) diagnosed as a myxolipoma.	0.7979992937559826
The patient suffered from recurrences in February 1995, September 1996 and February 1998.	0.4282497433981629
The diagnosis was revised at the time of the latest recurrence.	0.6605183921608421
A palliative resection with macroscopic residuals left was performed in February 1998, followed by a radiation therapy with 56 Gy total dose and a concomitant administration of the radiosensitizer razoxane per os.	0.5283801331308593
The single radiation doses were 200 cGy 5 times a week.	0.30002126739154267
The small residuals of the tumor obviously regressed although an objective response could not be shown because the lesion was not clearly measurable.	0.627465559380513
A follow-up 2 years after the radiation treatment revealed no recurrence.	0.6279095411799928
The time of the local control achieved as yet is already longer than any former time to regrowth between the surgical procedures.	0.6114501840552542
This is, to our knowledge, the first description of a therapeutic irradiation of a recurrent aggressive angiomyxoma.	0.832939079990468
Radiation therapy combined with the sensitizer razoxane is able to control a recurrent AAM for an unknown time.	0.4687524730839586
It remains open whether a radiation treatment alone would have had a similar effect.	0.4385675340440738
Micronervereconstruction of motor and sensitive nerves in the head and neck area today has an established range of indications.	0.48694095461589637
Surgical procedures of external and internal neurolyses, nerve coaptation and nerve transplantation techniques are well standardized.	0.46007406822214175
With microneurosurgery of motor nerves, satisfying or good results can be generally obtained.	0.4215122802387989
Success rates exceeding 50% following sensitive nerve reconstructions justify the performance of the procedures, more so because of the subjective improvements for the individual patient.	0.6786272412978805
Perspectives can be seen in further simplification of surgical methods of harvesting nerve grafts, e.g., by development of minimally invasive, eventually endoscopically guided procedures.	0.5459971316873947
Allogenic nerve grafts may also be applied.	0.5145736678101228
Initial experiments with nerve distractions are encouraging.	0.23012268921916212
A better understanding of nerve lesions on cellular and molecular biological levels may improve our knowledge of posttraumatic regulatory procedures and may lead to future possibilities of nonsurgical treatment options for peripheral and central nerve lesions by guided regeneration.	0.5144824898711658
Objective: The acceptance of fibromyalgia as a disease entity and its definitive diagnosis have been hampered by a dearth of knowledge concerning the underlying pathophysiology of this disease and the lack of specific biochemical markers applicable to its diagnosis.	0.648730192403845
To determine whether abnormal collagen metabolism is a characteristic of fibromyalgia, we have analyzed collagen metabolites in the urine and serum of patients with fibromyalgia.	0.8103198157749855
Methods: The diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria.	0.5850038591957083
Urine and serum were collected under standardized conditions from 39 patients and 55 age- and sex-matched controls.	0.6111388957032697
Pyridinoline (Pyd) and deoxypyridinoline (Dpyd), which represent products of lysyl oxidase-mediated cross-linking in collagen and are indicators of connective tissue and bone degradation, respectively, were analyzed by ion-paired and gradient HPLC method with fluorescence detection (HPLC).	0.5748875513266005
Levels of hydroxypyroline (Hyp), a collagen turnover marker, were also measured.	0.6131877437061001
The findings were related to creatinine levels and the Pyd/Dpyd ratio determined.	0.42588402816969484
The Pyd/Dpyd ratios in the urine and serum and the Hyp in the urine were significantly lower in patients with fibromyalgia than in healthy controls.	0.6043200180273758
Conclusion: Decreased levels of collagen cross-linking may contribute to remodeling of the extracellular matrix and collagen deposition around the nerve fibers in fibromyalgia and contribute to the lower pain threshold at the tender points.	0.4823014712421934
Analysis of altered collagen metabolism either by histologic examination on biopsy or, preferably, by HPLC analysis of collagen metabolites in urine or serum may aid to understand more about the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia.	0.5280587608583253
Background: The dynamic radionuclide nephrography (Tc99m-MAG3) is an important method in the evaluation of obstruction of the upper urinary tract.	0.7827384730290778
The aim of the present study was to assess whether radionuclid nephrography under standardized conditions with adequate hydration and Furosemid induced diuresis can reliably detect a significant obstruction at the pelvi-ureteric junction.	0.5216798001206343
We therefore tested whether minimal tracer washout (10-25%) in the presence of normal renal function could justity a non-operative managment.	0.6539297235754957
The lateral decubitus position is the standard position for nephrectomies.	0.5436519128824181
There is a lack of data about the effects of this extreme position upon respiratory mechanics and gas exchange.	0.5498881754153182
In 20 patients undergoing surgery in the nephrectomy position, we compared a new closed-loop-controlled ventilation algorithm, adaptive lung ventilation (ALV), which adapts the breathing pattern automatically, to the respiratory mechanics with conventionally controlled mandatory ventilation (CMV).	0.7239712125873604
The aims of our study were (1) to describe positioning effects on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange, (2) to compary ventilatory parameters selected by the ALV controller with traditional settings of CMV, and (3) to assess the individual adaptation of the ventilatory parameters by the ALV controller.	0.6878769987906805
The respirator used was a modified Amadeus ventilator, which is controlled by an external computer and possesses an integrated lung function analyzer.	0.5643505572109355
In a first set of measurements, we compared parameters of respiratory mechanics and gas exchange in the horizontal supine position and 20 min after changing to the nephrectomy position.	0.6710585573774865
In a second set of measurements, patients were ventilated with ALV and CMV using a randomized crossover design.	0.6216038179868697
The CMV settings were a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg body weight, a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min, an I:E ratio of 1:1.5, and an end-inspiratory pause of 30% of inspiratory time.	0.7467588314815244
With both ventilation modes FiO2 was set to 0.5 and PEEP to 3 cm H2O.	0.6323272054004815
During ALV a desired alveolar ventilation of 70 ml/kg KG - min was preset.	0.5859677937583112
All other ventilatory parameters were determined by the ALV controller according to the instantaneously measured respiratory parameters.	0.5490828221966458
Positioning induced a reduction of compliance from 61.6 to 47.9 ml/cm H2O; the respiratory time constant shortened from 1.2 to 1.08 s, whereas physiological dead space increased from 158.9 to 207.5 ml.	0.7509930516064918
On average, the ventilatory parameters selected by the ALV controller resembled very closely those used with CMV.	0.4136663663035775
However, an adaptation to individual respiratory mechanics was clearly evident with ALV.	0.5042185003874473
In conclusion, we found that the effects of positioning for nephrectomy are minor and may give rise to problems only in patients with restrictive lung disease.	0.6900723619773109
The novel ALV controller automatically selects ventilatory parameters that are clinically sound and are better adapted to the respiratory mechanics of ventilated patients than the standardized settings of CMV are.	0.46542544639130523
Noma is an ulcerative-necrotizing gingivo-stomatitis eventually leading to severe destruction of the midface, including lips and cheek, maxilla/mandible, nose and rarely the orbit.	0.4261965331671092
The defects are usually unilateral.	0.3580297394557001
Children from economically underdeveloped countries are predominantly affected.	0.22219304538179183
Medically untreated the disease has a high mortality rate, which can be dramatically lowered by adequate antibiotic therapy started in time.	0.6742334850053905
Predisposing factors include malnourishment, immunosuppression, and poor oral hygiene.	0.4742390199996634
Forty-eight noma patients were surgically treated in Sokoto, Nigeria during October 1997 by an Interplast Germany team sponsored by AWD Stiftung Kinderhilfe.	0.31424908386641026
Interdisciplinary surgical strategies and results, e. g. ankylosis release, local flap coverage and 12 pedicled musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi island flaps, as well as a noma classification (NOMAC), are presented.	0.5520910748085333
During a period of 3 years, four controled clinical studies in 34 patients with hypercholesterolaemia and 40 healthy persons - in some cases with stratification of the basic cholesterol levels and matched pair formation - were performed to find out the effects of serial sun-like UV irradiation on various serum parameters and blood circulation functions.	0.7500715640439615
The following significant effects were observed.	0.33112369955143667
Patients with hypercholesterolaemia: increase of HDL cholesterol after termination of the serial UV irradiation, increase of serum 25 (OH)D3 levels, decrease of serum triiodothyronine, decrease of serum lactate; healthy persons: decrease of resting pulse rate, decrease of recovery pulse rate, decrease of systolic blood pressure.	0.5764079518339477
All effects were induced by application of suberythematous UV doses, i.e.	0.31834715927126067
amounts of UV with a relatively low risk of side effects.	0.5610676443802093
In 1998 Minor et al.	0.18999064585553474
described a new variant of perilymphatic fistula: the "superior canal dehiscence syndrome".	0.43325643560500116
This syndrome is clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo and oscillopsia induced by loud noises or stimuli that result in changes in intracranial or middle ear pressure.	0.37865337398432297
It is caused by a dehiscence of bone overlying the superior (anterior) semicircular canal.	0.5058380400595107
Due to this dehiscence, a third, mobile window (in addition to the round and oval windows) is formed, and changes in pressure are pathologically transduced to the anterior semicircular canal.	0.7015866256508756
In the present study we evaluated proprioceptive capabilities of the knee joint with a balance test and correlated these findings to parameters which document mechanical stability.	0.6207302355175405
We compared 8 conservatively treated and 12 surgically treated patients with ACL-deficient knee joints with a control group of 12 subjects.	0.604927839896879
The balance test was performed with a Kistler force plate.	0.5879939645338736
Both the conservatively treated and the surgically treated patients showed significantly higher deviations of their centre of gravity than the control group.	0.5396874941621396
This was true not only for the injured leg but also for the noninjured contralateral leg.	0.5989949055662104
The differences were most remarkable when comparing the entire distance of centre of gravity deviations during 10 s. Additionally, the conservatively treated patients interrupted the test procedure significantly more frequently than the other two groups.	0.5702504077869868
We were not able to document any correlation between proprioceptive function and parameters for joint stability such as anterior drawer, Lachman, pivot shift and KT-1000 measurements.	0.36242794488456415
The study examined the validity of psychometric measures for the assessment of driving ability in brain-damaged subjects.	0.4910737024294166
116 patients with brain damage mainly of vascular and traumatic origin underwent  extensive neuropsychological examinations emphasizing attentional performance and visual perceptual speed and participated in a comprehensive on-road driving test.	0.4432162279670786
Only 58% of the patients passed the driving test.	0.705488754309661
Attempts to predict the outcome of the driving test by discriminant analysis or cut-off procedures based on neuropsychological and/or other subject-related data yielded a maximum of 73% correct predictions.	0.5658323121593751
In view of the frequent impairment in driving ability after brain damage and in view of the failure to reliably predict driving ability from psychometric test results, it is recommended that in each case an on-road driving test is given.	0.6105146897104916
In the planning of laser surgery for ENT operations, the specialist is often consulted by the anesthesiologist to predict possible intubation problems.	0.5626535045990474
Intubation problems in such operations can occur frequently due to the pathological findings present in the upper aerodigestive tract and the different constructions of laser-resistant endotracheal tubes.	0.6460747338830949
The aim of this study was to determine if a known predictive parameter could have a sufficient sensitivity and specificity to reliably predict possible intubation problems for ENT-related laser surgery.	0.5397809283902176
In a prospective study, 91 patients were included and the Mallampati-score modified by Samsoon and Young was analyzed and compared to a score describing the actual conditions of intubation.	0.600890464399632
The results showed a significant correlation (p <0.05, Chi-Square test).	0.7553254120776441
However, the specificity was only 72% and the sensitivity of 60% was too low to be of practical use.	0.8942482707880289
The results were independent of the endotracheal tube used.	0.7230385034156155
Although use of the laser for ENT operations provides a special situation for the anesthesiologist, there is still no system that is sensitive and specific enough to be of practical use.	0.7009109572853103
This problem is demonstrated in a literature  review.	0.6024647617081558
The treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with contraindications for a thrombolytic therapy is a therapeutic challenge.	0.7634222077081727
We report on a 12 year old patient who was treated for large cell lymphoma according to NHL-BFM 95: Block AA protocol.	0.625220861505828
During his therapy, he developed a thrombosis of his right femoral vein and pulmonary embolism affecting the left segments 4, 5, 8, and 9.	0.7878409923980176
Because of cerebral metastasis a fibrinolytic therapy was contraindicated.	0.31784007759419947
Therefore, we performed a mechanical thrombectomy using the Amplatz thrombectomy device.	0.6493600076677092
The postinterventional scintigraphy showed a markedly improved pulmonary perfusion; dopplersonography 4 months postinterventionally showed a patent right femoral vein.	0.3299563556915039
Within this chapter, tumors which produce bone matrix (osteoid) or other bone-forming tissues, like cartilage, connective tissue, and cementum or originate within the bone marrow are described.	0.6096177354451042
In addition, those lesions are mentioned which, according to the WHO, are typical for the jawbones and are therefore included within the 1992 WHO classification of odontogenic tumors.	0.6551737859070887
Vascular and epithelial tumors which may also be observed in the jaws are not described.	0.6788209617643991
All the lesions and tumors reported have in common a more or less similar clinical and radiological appearance.	0.5352490192748334
A precise diagnosis, therefore, can only be established by a sufficient biopsy which should be seen by a pathologist with experience in this field.	0.6482907814422124
In addition to clinical, radiological, and histological appearances, therapeutic necessities are described.	0.7474559376769122
The data from recent publications are taken into account.	0.5282837231181725
This presentation is based on the data collected within the reference registry of the German-Austrian-Swiss Study Group of Tumors of the Face and Jaws (DÖSAK) in Basel.	0.7841394697743731
Between 1987 and 1996 302 patients were treated for colorectal liver metastases.	0.6695479069837507
Out of this pool 252 completely documented cases were analysed.	0.3595243630715454
Forty-five patients (18 %) of this population were 70 years or older at time of admission.	0.7857928932224683
In this population 17 major resections and 8 minor liver resections were performed.	0.4505144370826993
In 9 patients irresectable metastases were diagnosed during treatment of the primary tumor.	0.6450377614063273
In 3 cases laparotomy had to be finished as exploration.	0.4957599312861364
Eight patients were treated without surgery.	0.6269365935382226
Mortality after liver resection was 4 %, morbidity 28 %.	0.6009776240659211
The 5-year-survival-rate (Kaplan-Meier) of the R0 resected patients (n = 21) was 44 %.	0.758651552331214
Comparison between the elderly patients and the younger population shows no significant differences in type and extent of treatment or in stage of disease.	0.7141847604885312
Survival, morbidity and mortality after liver resection also show no significant differences.	0.7384234234000395
These results show that even in elderly patients liver resection for colorectal metastases can be performed efficently and with a curative intention.	0.6601116161379945
The clinical course of 12 patients with mushroom poisoning was evaluated in order to define the parameters considered to be relevant to the indication for liver transplantation.	0.7605192199989126
Eight patients recovered under conservative therapy; one patient died due to pre-existing, concomitant cardiopulmonary disease.	0.6261762607468939
In three patients transplantations had to be performed because of severe liver failure.	0.7749469302557263
On admission, the transplanted patients had a decreased Quick's test score and factor V value (< 10 %).	0.6425174754155084
The peak of liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, partial thromboplastin time and azotemia were not of any prognostic value.	0.6404937217926656
Main indications for liver transplantation were a very low initial Quick's test score and factor V value (both < 10 %) and their inadequate response under substitution therapy.	0.657547137491433
The development of encephalopathy and renal failure were further parameters indicating poor prognosis.	0.3892269842361412
During submaximal isotonic back extension loading (31 male persons) surface-EMG was measured using 16 monopolar-linked electrodes in the low back region (L 3-S 1).	0.5310351021739884
By means of modification of amplitude- and frequency parameters in the EMG-signal two subject groups (6 persons each) with the slightest and most severe muscle fatigue in the paraspinal region were defined.	0.7048138572008597
For the analysis of muscle coordination, the EMG signal on the basis of an amplitude estimate at the beginning and at the end of the load situation was compared.	0.6609628852892444
During the extension phase, the group with slight fatigability showed no different spatial pattern of myoelectrical activity at the end of investigation than at the beginning.	0.5977861268539083
In contrast to this, the pattern of myoelectrical activity changed during the endurance test in the group of persons with considerable fatigability.	0.611864802283235
Therefore, in addition to the muscular fatigue also the loss of muscle coordination has to be taken into account in the assessment of spinal function.	0.8033935559803507
Background: A fractional flow reserve (FFRmyo) <0.75 is a well validated parameter for significance of coronary stenoses in cases of normal myocardial function.	0.7456903100614728
We used the FFRmyo limit in patients with impaired myocardial perfusion by myocardial infarction and/or hypertension for intermediate stenoses of the LAD for decision to PTCA and checked the indication by clinical follow-up.	0.5516600808341948
Distraction osteogenesis of the mandible is one treatment option in mandibular hypoplasia.	0.588672815016372
Usually, a non-continuous distraction mode is applied.	0.5956060778673669
The aim of the present study was to establish continuous bone distraction using a microhydraulic cylinder.	0.6659708573135864
Using a submandibular approach, the mandible was dissected subperiostally on one side in four mini-pigs; corticotomy was performed and the microhydraulic cylinder fixed with two bicortical screws.	0.5460231658039044
The hydraulic tube was connected with an automatic hydropneumatic injector system.	0.3298280518659307
Following 7 days at rest, a continuous distraction of 1.5 mm per day was performed for 14 days.	0.8480487820958515
After 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively, the animals were killed and X-rays taken.	0.8129475510127655
The mandible was then removed en bloc and microscopic evaluation of the sections was performed.	0.4710896151775451
The microhydraulic cylinder was easy to apply and to handle.	0.41384500619929965
The continuous stimulus did induce direct mineralisation of longitudinal oriented collagenous fibre bundles.	0.256208048550444
Bony regeneration seems to be accelerated, which might reduce the postoperatively stabilizing phase.	0.6393707271299786
The duration of spinal anaesthesia in infants is short compared to adult patients.	0.5155482165932466
When tetracaine is used, the addition of epinephrine significantly prolongs the duration.	0.4751775558358211
For bupivacaine, however, the influence of epinephrine on the duration is not clear.	0.585479400910332
We investigated the effects of epinephrine 1: 200 000 added to bupivacaine 0.5% on duration and haemodynamics.	0.6000857602627929
Ten former pre-term infants with postnatal respiratory problems, scheduled for bilateral inguinal hernia repair, were enrolled in the study after informed parental consent had been obtained.	0.6076209673532864
The infants were fasted at least 4 h prior to surgery.	0.2843878172921682
If they did not receive i.v.	0.305592574061449
infusions before surgery, a bolus of 10 ml/kg Ringer's acetate was injected after inserting the i.v.	0.4960295617893146
cannula, followed by a continuous infusion of 8 ml/kg 2/3 N NaCl with 5% dextrose.	0.5898670445491794
Spinal anaesthesia was performed in a sitting position with 0.6 ml bupivacaine 0.5%.	0.7875392184236361
Five patients received plain bupivacaine (group I) and five bupivacaine with epinephrine 1: 200 000 (group II).	0.7460518867104523
Heart rate registered by ECG and non-invasive blood pressure were recorded prior to positioning the baby for lumbar puncture and 2, 5, 10, and 20 min after injection of bupivacaine.	0.6621314157116801
The duration of spinal anaesthesia was defined as the time from injection to the time when the first movements of the legs were observed after stimulation.	0.8315173215610235
For testing statistical differences the U test was used between the groups and the Wilcoxon and Wilcox test within the groups.	0.490232986078758
Results (expressed as median and range).	0.3518990270237852
Additional epinephrine significantly prolonged the duration of spinal anaesthesia (group II: 95 min [60 - 120] vs group I: 50 min [37 - 85]).	0.7016038911032728
Haemodynamic parameters did not differ at any time between or within the groups.	0.5181556979807775
In group I, one infant had high spinal anaesthesia with impaired respiration but without cardiovascular effects; after 10 min of assisted ventilation by mask, sufficient respiration as judged by pulse oximetry and clinical observation had returned.	0.5670211800504691
The duration of spinal anaesthesia in this child was 60 min.	0.5615562268050002
Epinephrine 1: 200 000 significantly prolongs the duration of spinal anaesthesia in former preterm infants.	0.46477586102821916
Haemodynamic parameters in this age group remain unchanged during spinal anaesthesia and are not influenced by the addition of epinephrine.	0.5639756497538065
Purpose: Debate about the potential implementation of Spiral-CT in diagnostic algorithms of pulmonary embolism are often focussed on sensitivity and specificity in the context of comparative methodologic studies.	0.5729587519719844
