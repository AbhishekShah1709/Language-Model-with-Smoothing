We are monitoring the human rights situation through the reports of NGOs and the work of our human rights working group based in the EU embassies in Havana.	0.7533275611681042
We have regularly put our criticisms to the Cuban authorities, and this Parliament has done the same.	0.8701442296329462
But I do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate Cuba.	0.885268096163854
We want a fair and open society in Cuba, a Cuba which respects the principles of the market, the sanctity of contract and the rule of law.	0.8007945486302055
We want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	0.6563799848085322
My views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which I wish to deal, namely China.	0.7829637795240894
Quite simply, I want us to be engaged with China.	0.995690034070274
It would be self-indulgent and self-defeating, as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity, to want anything else.	0.6151187800863992
I also want to see a China transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy activists or religious believers.	0.5093445837132231
So what should we do?	0.515116186988704
Naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms.	0.6389425725222988
It is a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which does not include China - or Russia, for that matter.	0.9983015279402477
But I do not believe today, nor have I ever believed, that our burgeoning economic relationship with China - manifested, for example, by China' s EUR 25 billion surplus with the European Union - should silence us when it comes to China' s human rights record.	0.7939425670860705
For me the question is not whether we should address the question of human rights in China - we have a duty to do so and a legitimate interest in doing so - but rather what is the most effective way of doing this?	1.112356448538723
So what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year?	0.5480584719808497
As the presidency has noted, the Union as a whole is considering its position.	0.9738338329048256
But I strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the Member States ought to take proper account.	0.5724601376855879
First, while some people question whether tabling a Geneva resolution makes any difference, several of the most distinguished Chinese advocates of democracy strongly believe that it is a valuable move, not least because of the message it sends to people in China itself.	0.8113222038204202
That is a point that deserves serious consideration.	0.7734085178772927
Secondly, we will all want to take proper account of what has actually been happening in China in recent months, for instance, the heavy sentences imposed on democracy campaigners, the detention and recent punishments meted out to members of Christian churches and the arrests and sentences of the members of Falun Gong.	0.8153019663211661
Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet.	0.8352345636224526
We have made our views very clear to them.	0.6379162328896557
While we all know that for many people in China there has been a real long-term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties, there is a dark side to the picture as well.	0.7703014528611447
Critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with China.	0.7905260800353102
That is true and potentially valuable, although I have to say - and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked.	1.0535266128202954
Of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres.	0.7500698773455067
That is very welcome and I also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level.	0.6229555575972158
Naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long-term process, but I wish I could point to more real gains.	0.8748665422825974
The next dialogue in Lisbon on 25 February will be an important test.	0.6706231722280966
It will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not.	0.4756944707292177
What, finally, do we want to see as the first steps?	0.9581597304179165
Well, for example, we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them.	0.7220981371465099
I wish we were closer to that.	0.30843595271845425
Where does all that leave us this year?	0.28483150628474263
I repeat that Member States will have to make up their minds.	0.9449491639154467
What I hope is, first, that we in Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it, that we will not allow some to be picked off, that our position will not be based on self-delusion or pretence, that it will be a common position and a sensible position.	1.1665628547776974
I know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions.	0.7832480072955558
But if that is true, then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward.	0.8675292389339483
If we are to rest our position on the human rights dialogue, then we need to be able to convince you, the NGO community and the public at large that it is actually getting somewhere.	0.9658035922817707
That, in my judgement, is the challenge for the next few weeks.	1.296510534670518
I am grateful to the House for its concern about human rights around the world, and particularly in China.	0.8250222531166684
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	0.5834953176753255

. (DE) Mr President, following this vote, I would like to ask the competent Commissioner, Mr Byrne, if, now that he has seen how much support there is in this Chamber, he is prepared to adopt the proposed amendments?	1.035527467093138
. I regret to say that I believe that the thought-out position I advanced yesterday is the correct position.	0.9484067456471329
The comprehensive approach that the Commission intends to adopt on this issue will be brought forward as soon as possible under Article 152 where Parliament will have a codecision function.	0.7976209606347023
That is the appropriate way of dealing with this.	0.7921284829906827
Mr President, in accordance with Article 69 (2), I call for referral back to committee.	0.8004403115784232
The reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure, as proposed by the Commission.	0.8949115350793678
We have accepted this but have proposed further approximations of the legal effect measures that affect this directive, in particular the adoption of a text - which has been approved by the Commission overall - for the use and labelling of genetically modified organisms.	0.9951230285185744
We take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time, but the Commission will not adopt this.	1.1050029284896932
I believe that, in accordance with Article 69 (2), we must endeavour to enter into discussion with the Commission, and I would therefore urge my fellow MEPs to decide in favour of referral back to committee.	0.9230330708303389

In particular, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 6, 16, 21, 28, 31, 33, 34, 44, 45, 46, 48, 52, 53, 65, 67, 68, 75, 76, 78, 80, 84, 85, 88 and 102.	0.5354390477027415

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000)	0.3375123920659113
. (FR) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE.	0.936339912128427
I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries, whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean, countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries.	0.7354811099382662
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have, for the most part, been retained in the common position adopted by the Council.	0.7874311174746598
As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%).	0.7958408136045881
In my opinion, the most important amendments concern the following:	0.8048192966641898
LIFE' s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment, particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies, as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment;	1.022658093728313
Improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE, procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public, and procedures for cooperation between recipients;	0.7540035417079334
The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere;	0.9566385240428313
The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation.	0.8187674244287145
I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe.	0.5232865791747383
The other candidate countries (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries.	0.5747705885181028
The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004).	0.8053399589139918
The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million.	0.8174105160584209
I support Mrs Lienemann' s firm stance.	0.3555231516824394
The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created, even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement.	0.8205238518900421
If the report is adopted in plenary session, then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme.	0.9000701925328016
This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions!	0.5317843397507097
Böge report (A5-0023/2000)	0.16758399007695954
. (FR) As an MEP and, more importantly, as a consumer, I welcome the European Commission' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union.	0.9410276252849314
This proposal has two objectives: first, to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and, secondly, to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species.	0.6689063819159201
What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie.	0.7708729027783867
What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis.	0.8595005200877508
I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs.	0.7910439696070428
These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie.	0.6313973463321263
A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic.	0.3821946509290297
Even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective, especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie, it is still a notable improvement.	0.9331874669700935
It is a pledge to European citizens, who have voiced their concern, as regards European food policy, on many occasions.	1.096934045017405
The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard.	0.9449261109097519
As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution, traceability, responsibility and transparency, the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety.	0.8973209968085264
This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence.	0.8081021196324406
It is up to us, as responsible Europeans, to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive.	0.8370117351881821
Cederschiöld report (A5-0008/2000)	0.16101873178921944
Mr President, I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament.	1.000427216459034
In my view, products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products, namely, those that can be seen and touched.	0.7033930559053102
The fruits of the intellect and science, which are intangible, are of inestimable importance. Therefore, the European Community should be more energetic in providing practical encouragement, not just through upholding patents but through concessions and other forms of support for scientists who are striving, through the knowledge and experience they have acquired, to give future generations something better than that which they have today.	0.8635041406689276
. (DA) We oppose, on principle, the European Community' s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the Member States.	0.8849144492220923
We are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the Member States and the Community. At the same time, we appreciate the fact that the WIPO treaties are a significant step forward in the direction of guaranteeing the rights of distributors and practising artists.	0.850232698421827
We are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation.	0.7418049300616824
- (DE) The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because, in the plenary debate of the previous day, Commissioner Bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding EU accession to the WIPO Treaties.	0.84352627295322
In institutional terms, there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties.	0.8005206090918142
In addition, there is a clear tendency, in matters of international jurisdiction, more and more often to obtain a pure EU jurisdiction.	0.8899892413956876
When it is, then, still not clear to what extent the EP can participate in the decision-making processes, the question of legitimacy arises.	0.8936404588645623
Moreover, the concept of 'author' is not defined in the Treaties.	0.7496999908379084
In this regard, too, the Commission has not answered the question as to what definition it wishes to base its discussions on, and whether it wishes to settle foreseeable conflicts by imposing its own definition of the law on others.	0.8012143631598455
One of the trickiest aspects is the public interest: will ratifying and applying WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture?	0.5938454777157567
And, finally, the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarified. Regarding this, too, there has been only silence by way of a response from the Commission.	0.7993443649413383
If nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation, then we must at least abstain from voting.	0.6526566897202674
Graefe zu Baringdorf (A5-0015/2000)	0.28022855809305747
. (PT) Food safety issues are in the spotlight following the BSE and dioxin scandals.	0.6932843112686732
GMOs are still the subject of great uncertainty, both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health.	0.6794795368961836
The precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty.	0.4722164167794567
The use of biotechnology needs to be studied in greater depth and not just "packaged" for immediate sale to boost the profits of a few multinationals in this sector.	0.7058674819665346
The profit motive is very much behind the present food safety crises.	0.5419829118851065
This is the context that the rapporteur finds himself working in, making a legal link between the issue of GMOs and feedingstuffs, and noting that the latter "shall be authorised only if ... safe for human health and the environment" .	0.8525006269185693
Furthermore, he considers that "genetically modified additives shall be clearly identified as such on any label or any document, official or otherwise, which is affixed to or accompanies the additive" .	0.6388636869454397
This will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer' s freedom of choice.	0.5832492083756813
In view of the Montreal Protocol on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), I welcome the fact that the rapporteur has included these issues in his report, and I have therefore voted in favour of it.	0.9147313960440688
Stenzel report (A5-0034/2000)	0.18476838010842317
Mr President, I would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote, on behalf of the PPE Group on the EQUAL report.	0.9462926173137135
We have followed a nominal list which was identical to that which we had agreed upon beforehand with the Socialist Group.	0.5461773851052159
The Socialist Group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been.	1.0207997412119838
This is why we are abstaining.	0.7934785844909106
We want to ensure that the EQUAL report, which is very important for refugees, the elderly, the handicapped and women, simply goes ahead.	1.0255147523110277
It is regrettable that, due to the procedure, the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session.	0.8110246920680071
I am convinced that the rapporteur' s nationality has played a certain role, which should not be of relevance in this Parliament.	0.8585110510476871
This is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament.	0.6335208043520112
These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report.	0.5491186699700494
We want EQUAL to go ahead.	0.42577423918325075
We assent to the main thrust of it, but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage.	0.7681573853121486
Mr President, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party in the European Parliament, I abstained in the vote on the EQUAL initiative because, although it provides more support than in the past for projects aimed at combating age discrimination, its proposals are not sufficiently trenchant or specific.	0.94243954545019
I also abstained for another reason. I think the time has come for the European institutions to stop experimenting and trying to establish best practices for doing what we should do and begin to give European citizens some firm indication regarding what Europe wants Europe to be.	0.8228386667875134
The time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice.	0.4600509623141425
. (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for EU initiative programmes (CIP).	0.7149983913830582
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote is only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have simply adopted a position on the issue.	0.9826528526521865
We think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report.	0.9044575762431314
. (FR) We did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market.	0.742029132148217
Nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague, all too pie in the sky.	0.8249931802073909
And yet, in the chapter on aid and training for refugees, the report marks a step backwards from the initial text by stipulating that they no longer apply to refugees as such but to "refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Convention" .	0.7103664173482318
This restriction is inadmissible at a time when countless refugees throughout Europe are in a drastic situation, with no protection, forced to work on the black market, and to hide, while so-called democratic governments and state police forces hunt them down.	0.8376729072242131
The first thing we need to do in this area is to give these stateless people the legal means to live a decent life and be able to work without being relegated to the status of pariahs, the victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple forms of administrative and police harassment, the main form of which is having to live in permanent fear of expulsion.	0.8288995825390153
.	-0.0
I voted in favour of Mrs Stenzel' s report on the EQUAL initiative as I believe that it is essential to continue the work begun under the previous NOW, HORIZON, YOUTHSTART and INTEGRA strands of the ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT initiatives.	0.7819394961811866
The lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on.	0.6003838233190917
EQUAL stands for "equality" .	0.35037217829384454
It must be seen to deliver.	0.6980736865095627
I welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market.	0.5191838232848217
I also favour the desire to move away from an out-dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment.	0.43531309043119304
There must be flexibility.	0.5545447791534108
I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative.	0.5159994074906575
In the last programming period 9% of Structural Funds were available for Community initiatives.	0.7248589965004064
The figure is now 5.35%.	0.34680657019374994
This means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated.	0.5607378872623795
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee adopted several of the amendments I put forward, concerning for example, the emphasis on access to start-up capital, how to exploit new business opportunities in cities, towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business.	0.7888585833974114
This often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities.	0.36708669632194174
The positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process.	0.4354734396428719
I also stressed the need for prevention.	0.4932076137785001
The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted.	0.8268680900054536
There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority.	0.6657604929032607
There must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets.	0.5228664350647428
While there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way, overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported.	0.9916356523307895
.	-0.0
(PT) The Commission intends to use the Community initiative EQUAL to replace the Community EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT initiatives and various subprogrammes in these areas, such as NOW, on new opportunities for women, HORIZON, for disabled persons, YOUTHSTART, for promoting the labour market integration of young people, and INTEGRA, for groups threatened with exclusion. Unfortunately, this involves a significant reduction in appropriations.	0.8570153988731047
Accordingly, the Commission will use this initiative to develop what it considers to be new ways of fighting discrimination and inequality of all kinds in the labour market, based on the four pillars of the employment policy guidelines.	0.7982684283134417
This is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations.	0.9080295484674612
However, in order to give this new approach some chance of success, the Commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal, a more simple and direct one, involving the NGOs from the outset, so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way.	0.9308475838656546
The Commission did not do that.	0.4289474317102903
We hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned.	0.9297749925439082
Mr President, some of us in Parliament will remember the successful film, "Cocoon", in which some elderly people drank a special kind of water that made them young again.	0.7626977420567073
In my view, it is, therefore, immensely important to exercise extreme vigilance over the water we all drink and, consequently, to study and approve the provisions referred to here.	0.5738596590741023
For that reason, I approved these measures, but I should also like to express the hope that there will be particularly rigorous monitoring of water purity at the point where it enters our houses, to ensure that it is of the highest level.	0.9746104393955983
In the measures that have been adopted, I note that support for people who purify their water in their own homes has been omitted. I trust that this will be remedied in the future.	0.965246542846744
Apart from Amendment No 76, which was an error, since I intended to vote in favour, the rest of my votes can be explained by means of the following fictional situation:	0.9549692088515114
Supposed draft environmental directive: "European Parliament and Council Directive establishing the obligation to maintain, during winter, a temperature of no less than eighteen degrees centigrade in the streets, squares and parks of the cities of Europe ".	0.7301062207816936
Guidelines of the Directive: a) each city shall provide the means, in terms of energy and technology, sufficient for this objective to be achieved by 2012; b) the full costs shall be passed on to the inhabitants of each city by means of electricity prices.	0.7443358721446655
Opinion of an MEP from the north of Europe: "This Directive would be unfair since, for example, the cost for an inhabitant of Stockholm would be two hundred times greater than the cost for an inhabitant of Naples ".	0.6476932438187498
Opinion of an MEP from the south of Europe: "Nevertheless, this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions".	0.7541302902995888
(End of fiction).	0.2004223764109705
In explaining my vote, I must say that it is positive that there is a Community directive on water, but I believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of Europe, but will lead to legislative caricature.	1.006942777514931
We cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts, such as the Mediterranean countries, and countries with northern levels of rainfall.	0.6429198705822919
Furthermore, it would show a lack of solidarity to make transfers of water, between different river basins, practically impossible in the future.	0.742578295395941
Once more we must remember that we are undergoing a continental project for political union.	0.6293872151002184
.	-0.0
(FR) Drinking, eating, washing, farming - water irrigates each act of our daily life and we treat it, wrongly, as an unfailing and inexhaustible resource.	0.6395848148036445
A simple gesture such as turning on a tap seems to bring water straight from the source.	0.34314916400325723
But the source is threatening to run dry.	0.3716837035593629
Scientific studies are now no more than a formality: water will be the main resource at stake in years to come, starting tomorrow.	0.7356109748072013
But tomorrow will be too late.	0.31181962207977004
We have to lay down the rules of play today, before we all lose.	0.9309460429647103
In adopting the water directive on Wednesday 15 February, the European Parliament confirmed its wish to protect surface water, coastal wasters, inland waters and groundwater.	0.6225385473027006
Europe now has a framework which will allow it to prevent any deterioration in the quality of water, promote its sustainable use, protect eco-systems, help fight floods and droughts and eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.	0.6732200338448119
We have thrown water a life-belt.	0.3748985075992077
. (FR) It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy.	0.733730348408867
The ecological disaster on the banks of the Danube is a reminder, as if we needed one, that all too often human negligence jeopardises natural resources such as water.	0.8669600514040047
The objective of this proposal for a directive, which dates back to 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water, coastal waters, inland waters and groundwater.	0.7997656857715442
It provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration, protect ecosystems, promote sustainable water use, help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.	0.6016289103387548
Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework.	0.5546344275778795
The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy.	0.4135562318294618
The proposal for a directive was amended twice, first in 1997 and then in 1998.	0.8423479129707092
A technical working party made up of Council and Parliament representatives met in January 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions.	0.6550821611330939
However, the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments, most of which I support.	1.0216312780379297
As far as the timetable and objectives are concerned, the Council' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive, while the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years.	0.773409883019365
The committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020, the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020.	0.7448992023065105
The Council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years, but the Commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years.	0.7451401848405427
All the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years, not 16.	0.7160783144334812
I must say that I support these reduced deadlines, especially as provision is made for derogations.	0.8323383464698071
As far as costs are concerned, I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources.	0.8061787978049121
I likewise expect the European Commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012.	0.8261910282086761
I will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, which needs no further comment: "Water is not a commercial product like any other but, rather, a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the European Union and which must be protected, defended and treated as such" .	0.8610769160699412
. I wish to put on the official record my concerns with the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote.	0.7793983784991815
We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water.	0.815347367382298
There is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur.	0.8351202264780738
However, the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which, under the rules of subsidiarity, should be left to the Member States for decision.	1.0171403345220213
In my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue.	0.5406885668933262
In Ireland all the major users of water, commercial, industrial and agricultural, already pay for their use of water.	0.6779281505504593
This is a decision of national and local government, and this is where all future decisions should be retained.	1.00812286922822
These are the main reasons for my vote.	0.6549289321697559
. The European Union is currently in the process of adopting new EU water legislation to update and to establish a long-term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters.	0.8821291568190464
I support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy.	0.866241183861781
However, I do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used.	0.8336995207115299
Water, in this context, is a commercial commodity.	1.1735232481693547
It is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life.	0.6052493671938413
We see it as positive that an attempt is being made to reverse the trend towards water degradation, which is most alarming and which governments all too often tend to sweep under the carpet.	0.670561363429723
We all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved.	0.6762880637543239
But it is also essential to bear in mind that the various elements of water policy cannot be separated, and that action on this aspect will affect all the others.	0.9803761064028507
The "physico-chemical and ecological quality of water" was highlighted during the debate and in the proposals, and the adverse effects of other aspects was, at best, touched upon marginally.	0.7785711478596665
It is essential to be aware of the widely varying situations in different Member States, such as specific climatic conditions, water regimes and fluctuations in them over the year, the social, economic and ecological effects of applying standards, and also of the failure to do so.	0.8414777481085086
It was because of our concern about these issues that we disagreed with some of the proposals put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and in particular those relating to an excessively restrictive timetable and to the scant attention paid to social and agricultural aspects, which are very important for a country like Portugal, which suffers from water shortage problems and also inadequate socio-economic development.	0.8419590002684758
But we also believe that, in many cases, the proposals put forward by the Commission and the Council represent too much of a step backwards, which is why we would like to see a vote balanced between the various requirements in the proposals presented to us.	1.0579384616700547
. (FR) We are disappointed by the Council' s common position on this proposal for a framework directive.	0.9761941349415273
It is minimalist on a number of points, especially with regard to the dates of entry into force of far too many provisions and the number of, and conditions for, implementing the derogations.	0.7252097480204074
However, the main problem is with the definition of the objective which the European Union wishes to pursue with this text.	1.0094029277353205
The objective is of course to create, first and foremost, a clear general framework which will allow the law in this area to be simplified.	0.9142062350648609
However the Union should be seeking, beyond that, to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater.	0.8321844188233958
Public health and the supply of drinking water are at stake, as are biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural areas and species.	0.827639523485772
From this point of view, the common position is weak.	0.85100325196736
I should like to see our Parliament defend a more ambitious position than the Council' s position, but I should also like that position to be equally credible.	0.8971736243907317
The "zero input" and "zero pollution" requirement, including for substances naturally present in water, is not realistic.	0.81899007940773
I am not one of those MEPs who thinks that it is essential to adopt "extremist" amendments at second reading with the sole aim of gaining room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiations with the Council of Ministers.	0.7341326755169152
On the contrary, I object to this systematically applied strategy.	0.6380966205000485
It damages Parliament.	0.07184001274562343
Our messages to our citizens and to the Council are muddled and lack credibility.	1.0181959865304908
Overly strict, unrealistic environmental objectives will not be applied because they are unattainable.	0.6214513028298649
Is that the message we want to send out?	0.8474724890870714
There is one other specific point which is dear to me: Member States should be able, if they so wish, to set up trans-national water transfers.	0.9228131414007131
This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity, which we have always defended, and, as such, should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds).	0.9304271458971797
I would like to remind the House that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European water networks two years ago and I would be most obliged if the European Commission could shortly tell Parliament what action it has taken on that report.	0.8831039828050994
.	-0.0
(ES) We have seen a report concerned with water quality in Europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war.	0.7202248749761937
We all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective, above all, given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment.	0.596402314335912
It is clear that this model' s logic of private profit has been harmful, and therefore the 'polluter pays' principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences.	0.7548508246908102
However, apart from these principles, there is the consideration that water, as a common resource, cannot be subjected to the rules of the market.	0.9493899382925111
Surprisingly, I imagine with the best of intentions, this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers, and especially the agricultural sector, responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality.	0.8546071479024544
In fact, water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market.	0.6638695343042893
This means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water.	0.5720647654042098
By failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant, and is therefore not a problem, from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity, stifling the chances of any economic and social development, we are perverting the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon.	0.8292916744777175
In the same way it is somewhat ironic that we are hindering the possibility of sharing this commodity, which is scarce in some areas, while regions where there is abundant water are giving advice on austerity with regard to its use, to those who live in drought areas.	0.8639512046266835
As a result of this lack of sensitivity and solidarity, my vote has been consistent with what I have said, as an MEP from one of the dry Mediterranean agricultural regions - although one with prospects - namely, the Region of Murcia.	0.8568720550330137
. On behalf of the European Parliament Labour Party, I wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the Lienemann report, we have certain reservations.	0.949390624494006
The timetable set in the report of 2020 is unrealistic and impracticable, but the timetable set by the Council of 2034 is too far in the distance.	1.0058587866854714
We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	0.42670284423429505
We have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater.	0.509257522440066
We believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near pristine standard.	0.5430363251589353
The foregoing is the reason for our vote.	0.5462411242843691
.	-0.0
(FR) Water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed.	0.5451833114218998
The framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area.	0.7123813394614278
It has clear, ambitious objectives.	0.4260695859722603
We share them.	0.2960436785565098
It sets environmental parameters close to zero.	0.36761942874008857
But we feel that it would be wiser not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet.	0.5554785443380447
We need a timetable, by all means, but a more gradual timetable.	1.0461321023721004
The legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation, i.e. to stop discharges within 20 years, would in fact mean a ban on all identified substances.	0.8397175325053894
Such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross-border areas and in candidate countries, thereby complicating enlargement.	0.6248345930604985
I should like, naturally, to refer to a specific sector to which I am very closely attached, i.e. agriculture, the main water-consuming sector. Agriculture must accept its share of 'polluter pays' charges, and has in fact already started to do so, but account must also be taken of its special characteristics and constraints, especially in arid regions.	0.9567449261335627
As regards the amendments concerning radioactive substances, I am of course in favour of controls, but the question arises of the legal basis, which comes under the Euratom Treaty.	1.0881300440824093
Andersson report (A5-0033/2000)	0.19584030170333444
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the Andersson report. This does, of course, contain a number of good observations.	0.6887792249272993
For example, it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that "the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the Member States make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the Member States' social security systems" .	0.8276088380281422
Now, the concept of "uniform harmonisation" is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question. It is also true, as it states in the explanatory statement, that harmonisation could be damaging as "it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security.	0.8527919812901535
No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation" .	0.49204639069719286
The situation, however, is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation, and uniform harmonisation into the bargain.	0.7882090819344836
Paragraph D points out that "the Union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria" , and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the Ecofin Council and the Social Affairs and Employment Councils.	0.8656532287134531
Finally, paragraph 7 emphasises that "the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" . And, in this regard, we approach the heart of the matter.	0.9823980211975466
This project, with its social harmonisation, does not constitute social policy. Instead, it is an extension to the EU' s EMU project, which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside EMU and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship, namely Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark.	0.8922935489086649
It is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project.	0.8469557636485838
) Mr President, I voted for the Council's strategy for modernising social protection because, in my view, it constitutes a step towards the establishment of European social and pensions legislation, although it does not actually go the whole way.	0.9206641979203942
I was sorry to hear what was said in the previous explanation of vote, since I believe that, in essence, the report aims to provide much better protection for the elderly, despite the fact that, as we all know, the governments of the 15 Member States would like to reduce pensions to the minimum.	1.022266725331939
I hope that Parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pensions.	0.9294506150441554
The elderly are waiting for the European Parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with greater dignity than they do now.	0.9259533307967224
The countries who have made less progress in this field should attain the same level as the countries within the European Union that guarantee better social protection.	0.7030617858090961
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted today in favour of the report by our Swedish Social Democratic colleague, Jan Andersson, on the Commission' s communication concerning a coordinated strategy for modernising social security.	0.7832614911172001
The starting point for the Commission' s communication is the implementation of EMU which, with its demand for stability and growth, creates the basis for the Member States' being able to maintain their social security arrangements.	0.8758352229987973
The report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but, rather, better use of available resources.	0.7814670095015748
We also notice that, according to the explanatory statement, modernisation does not mean harmonisation of social security arrangements, either, and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time that competitive considerations might exert pressure on others to cut back.	0.7250435267534879
No-one would benefit from this situation.	0.47685055783982694
Both in the communication from the Commission and in the report by Mr Andersson, it is emphasised that it is the Member States which have responsibility for and, therefore, also determine the content of, social security arrangements.	1.0915134683630456
Cooperation on these matters within the framework of the EU should create added value, based on the exchange of experiences and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policies are developing, the aim being to define best practice.	0.8361212803087643
. (SV) We consider that the report contains many practical proposals, which we support, but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report.	1.0365282774258466
In particular, we oppose the sections which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the Commission' s becoming involved in telling the Member States what to do (see, for example, paragraph 7).	0.7420730406726481
We wish to emphasise that the sphere of social and social security policy should chiefly be the domain of the Member States, even if the enlargement of the EU requires a greater degree of coordination than there has been in the past.	0.8809261110932483
. (FR) The current difficulties faced by our social security systems derive mainly from a shortage of income as the result of unemployment, poverty and an ageing population rather than from excessive spending.	0.6177389750659505
The policies of the European Union also have much to answer for in this situation.	0.8886078546303346
Of course we need to modernise these systems.	0.6425599037209337
In France, in particular, we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions.	0.6736308458834716
We also need to reform archaic management methods which create injustices, chaos and waste.	0.4239186456405516
More importantly, we need a family policy to promote demographic growth and an economic, monetary and fiscal policy to promote growth and reconquer the internal market so that we can create jobs.	0.8314042117891677
The Commission and the Andersson report are not proposing a social policy; they are giving Brussels exorbitant decision-making powers as regards funding, i.e. as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of Europe, which is why we voted against this text.	0.9423437140931212
Social protection should be an expression, first and foremost, of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost, exclusively in fact, under the jurisdiction of the nation state.	0.695815027295676
Social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences.	0.8078969389819414
Otherwise it is merely the financial processing, at the expense and to the detriment of European citizens, of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration.	0.8233139692155227
.	-0.0
(SV) We have abstained from voting for Jan Andersson' s report on a coordinated strategy for modernising social security.	0.6881236764230874
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.	0.6196940415991554
As Swedish Liberals, we see European integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management.	0.7609465078382252
In these areas, Europe' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity.	0.6218739184225804
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect.	0.8805208415735081
That is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see.	0.9061028752230099
It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with, which is to say cross-border issues.	0.9505317140135736
All other questions ought to be dealt with at local, regional or national levels.	0.5595290166470452
Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU ought only to have limited powers, except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union.	0.900388466518936
Each Member State ought to have full responsibility for, and the right autonomously to decide upon, its social security systems.	0.9516157867974877
Health care, child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational.	0.6836938076007691
The same applies to labour market policy.	0.3465538484182356
We do not believe that common European legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security.	0.9145786102844743
For us, it is important that the EU should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use.	0.9864180976929396
That does not, however, prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere.	0.6064449843620624
Equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our Liberal agenda.	0.5763108697512487
We wholeheartedly support, at national level, many of the ideas presented in Mr Andersson' s report.	0.832529052544081
. (IT) The report gives a clear impression that the concerted strategy for modernising social protection in Europe will be accompanied by an analogous process of cohesion.	0.796640986358646
We therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intentions.	0.3720005480861825
Numerous policies have already gone in this direction, albeit laboriously, and many more still need to do so before Europe, in terms of subsidiarity, is seen as one house, not only by its own people, but also by those in the candidate countries.	1.0282918940727945
Moreover, the European welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation.	0.983101926646628
Consequently, if such systems are to continue to sustain development in the future, in light of the economic and employment changes taking place, as well as the requirements of society, modernisation is absolutely essential.	0.971149271319919
There are three main aspects that need to be highlighted.	0.595420787985031
The first is that economic policy, employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional.	0.9148354106017327
The second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them.	0.5509549590717733
Nowadays, it is becoming more commonplace, as well as efficient, to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes.	0.7382238347450863
But, in our view, that does not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduced, either as regards the universality or, we hope, the quality of the basic social protection provided.	1.1057122713623453
It is, to a large extent, a principle of justice that imbues both health and pension schemes as well as social assistance, where, in particular, strategic coordination by the public authority is essential, even though it has been modernised.	0.9088778024702129
The third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the European Union.	0.6981130920223831
Today, a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking, and the current systems are, in the main, run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual Member States.	0.9687405520178194
Therefore, any modernisation process has to take account of economic, employment and social protection differences between the various countries, whether Member States or candidate countries.	1.0217730569834973
What is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process, which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences, should have the will and the know-how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse.	0.8848878405399591
It is, after all, a matter of civilisation, progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community.	0.7585973315566615
. (SV) The basic values common to the Member States of the European Union are based upon democracy, human freedoms and rights, and a social market economy.	0.9752146539724509
These values must be given expression in the form of solidarity with the weaker groups in our society and in the world around us.	0.8149532698390936
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is the Member States themselves which devise their own social security systems.	0.7775767761014395
Inhabitants of countries in the European Union ought, nonetheless, to be able to benefit from a minimum network of social protection, irrespective of which country they live in.	0.7804494371087126
The report seeks "effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" , without going on to define more specifically what this means.	0.5511787980132927
As we see it, such a position constitutes unduly large interference in national fiscal policy and cannot, therefore, be supported.	0.6694635078402558
We are therefore voting against paragraph 7 of the report.	0.761822927657935
The report emphasises the social dimension of European cooperation, which is something to be welcomed.	0.884311125451924
It is nonetheless important to clarify what role the EU is to play, and not to play, with regard to social security.	1.017272123952831
Clarification of this kind is missing from the report, which is unfortunate.	0.9620645688053793
. (EL) On reading the Commission' s statement on social protection, which is animated by so many good intentions, one wonders whether its authors and the working people in Europe are living on the same continent and in the same social reality.	0.9134519950139286
One also wonders whether this 'coordinated modernisation strategy' is not just another misrepresentation of the coordinated and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquired rights of working people.	0.6963228749429465
We agree with many of the rapporteur' s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the Commission' s and the Council' s intentions and plans concerning social protection.	0.7361833018111198
The general lines of the implemented economic policy, the Stability Pact and the strict convergence programmes, which are a constant menace to employment and which promote employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations, and the organisation of labour, along with Commission and the ESF decisions relating to salary and wage restraint, and the insistence upon austere budgetary discipline and upon achieving much-vaunted monetary stability at all costs, leave no doubt about the new strategy' s objectives and aspirations.	0.7712623877311495
Its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security, and for flexibilising social protection itself.	0.7333067960104158
When social security has repeatedly, and in the words of many influential people, been characterised as a 'cost' and an 'obstacle' to greater competitiveness and when ways are being sought to transfer that cost from companies to working people - always, of course, on the pretext that this will create jobs - it would surprise us if the existing model of market economy without accountability, with its dismal monetary-economic approach to everything and total dependence on monopolistic interests, were to take under its protection the fundamental right of the citizens to social protection and care.	0.786835896439134
Clearly, what is being attempted is to move away from organised systems of social security under state control, towards systems based on private insurance agencies, which will generate new profits for capital and place even greater burdens on working people, who besides the higher cost, will 'enjoy' even more degraded social provisions.	0.7317674507182026
The fostering of illicit competition between public and private social security systems and between the systems of the Member States is not only unjustifiable, but, on the contrary, makes manifest the political expediencies and intolerable pressures imposed upon social security systems to weaken or even do away with them, to the benefit of the private sector and the law of profit.	0.8130585291401354
It is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems.	0.762741445066653
So how is it possible to speak about healthy and economically sustainable social security systems when we are faced with the millions of unemployed, impoverished and marginalised people, the 'working poor' of part-time employment, and working conditions that are dissociated from the policies implemented?	0.7270378339745475
Social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in Europe, and were achieved after many years of battling against the aspirations of big business, and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people.	0.7447444355437538
Today, in the Europe of unemployment and underemployment, it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people, but this demands a different system of economic and social development, which the EU cannot possibly create, because of its nature and character.	1.033295359339532
On the basis of these views, we wish to express our categorical opposition to the 'modernisation' of the social protection system that the Commission statement is promoting, and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is under discussion.	1.1102372277385468
That concludes the explanations of vote.	0.4662591538478535

Next session of UN Human Rights Commission (continuation)	0.5181826800797112
The next item is the debate on the Council declaration on the establishing of the EU priorities for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (20 March 2000), including the situation in China.	0.8703213475614231
Mr President, I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. This is a Council declaration, and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate.	1.1303367945720655
I think it is worth reminding you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflects the need, which has been expressed by all the political Groups, for Parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue, one which is so dear to this House.	1.035460823057311
Following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see.	1.0831044453665548
At a European Union level we must recognise that the situation is not completely satisfactory, since, for example, although the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a common instrument in all Member States, not all subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all of them.	0.953883664561899
Another clear drawback in this area is the fact that the European Union itself is not a signatory to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails.	0.9059597421299156
I hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights.	0.8538871879523043
With regard to foreign affairs, I believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism, Mr President. Issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world, demand a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union.	0.8657780235270899
In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would like to stress one in particular, that is, the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations.	1.0578611619676188
Mr President, in a world such as this, which is increasingly dominated by the phenomenon of globalisation, and not only in the economic field, our responses, in order to be effective, must be concerted and coordinated.	1.1110996359358223
In order to make our actions effective, we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present.	0.8826447985646105
This Parliament therefore advocates the principle that we need to participate in the Commission on Human Rights and other international fora which deal with these issues and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this Parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible.	0.9055038923237565
Soon, in May, the European Commission intends to present a communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratisation in the Union' s external relations.	1.129572293335811
I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to take good note of this need for coordination, which I have just mentioned, and to seek new formulas which will strengthen the role played by the European Union in the field of human rights and, in particular, by this Parliament, especially from the point of view of coherence, recognising the good will of those third countries which accept the inclusion of the democratic clause.	1.0085920179629275
I believe that this should be applied to all areas, in particular also the budgetary area.	1.1467215016816725
Lastly, I must recognise the important contributions made by civil society in this area, as well as the often underestimated role of the numerous non-governmental organisations who act on the ground.	0.8757003724456954
The Union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work.	0.7572171952612017
Mr President, Commissioners, when this House is called upon to debate human rights it is taking a chance, if you will, that is reinforced by the conditions that prevail when we are called upon to discuss such a crucial issue.	0.874471208161722
The absence of the Council, as well as of the majority of MEPs, shows just how great the divide is between our noble, elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day-to-day policies when it comes to human rights.	0.6378294419751397
I believe that, as a beginning, Parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the Geneva session to narrow that divide. It should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support.	0.9073216783060214
We must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the headlines or abuses are being punished.	0.6955477932791344
The role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on, particularly at the level of prevention.	0.8903432089888187
In that sense, we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law.	0.7165112630479911
It seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed.	0.7681348885972203
Nowadays, there are many, perhaps too many, treaties on human rights. If those treaties remain mere expressions, they are no more than useless depositories of people's thoughts.	0.9103962842501476
The time has come to move on to a new and crucial phase, namely a phase in which the provisions of the treaties are applied on a daily and binding basis, although we ought not forget that some basic treaties are still to be transposed.	0.9818326451420907
I refer to the Rome Conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 Member States of the Union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court.	0.7379123729422087
In my view, we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally.	0.8319337055736945
We have often employed instruments which, at the formal level, make us feel comfortable, but which, in terms of practical results, are totally ineffectual.	0.9324344731604844
By that I mean the use, and often abuse, of embargoes during recent years, and the over-cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the European Union and third countries, where there have been human rights violations.	0.9592362300543991
In particular, we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded.	0.9129711171600037
Globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process.	0.4339206773168573
Many countries are currently questioning the principle of the universality of human rights. The belief is widespread that many human rights, including the right to life, contradicted as it is by the death penalty, depend on certain variables, while globalisation, which often has a negative connotation, is in danger of becoming the catch-all for rights, actions and policies everywhere in the world.	0.8540525212077568
We should therefore do what is necessary to update the areas in which we can intervene, with renewed strength, to safeguard human rights.	1.0244053127078265
In that context I would mention the following: social rights, workers' rights, quality of work, the need to ensure respect, where necessary, for all the criteria laid down by the International Labour Organisation, the right to tolerance and to respect - a right to which all minorities are entitled, particularly within the European Union.	1.0135086481014093
I would also mention the right to develop. It is the right of all peoples who, in turn, are the sum of countless individuals each one of whom has the right to develop and to a future that, most importantly, is full of hope and personal growth, within each individual society.	1.0565040680653859
All those aspects should be part of a rationale, a discourse and a contribution which the European Union should bring to human rights.	0.8108742067006521
I hope that Parliament's participation in the Geneva session turns out to be more than just a token presence and that its representatives do more than just listen to and give evidence. First and foremost they should use the occasion to affirm that we regard the aspects I have just mentioned as central to the identity of the European Union and of the European nation, and that we also uphold the principle of the universality of human rights that transcends time and place.	0.9371122510629876
That is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments, even if it goes against their interests.	0.9076214813208924
Mr President, one of the saving features of this Parliament is that here we practise a consistent and active human rights policy: the flag flies high, as Mrs Malmström put it.	0.8495427957773005
At the same time, however, we shut our eyes to the Union' s own problems: to the violence, inequality, and fourth world reality, which is part of everyday life in the EU.	0.8872226737976542
It is absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violations of human rights that are to be the subject of talks in Geneva.	0.8602428326486865
The rhetoric that we use, however, often smacks of smugness, verging on the sort of narcissism we associate with human rights attitudes in North America.	0.4768650668396059
It is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non-EU countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum-seekers, whose position is now becoming more difficult in the EU.	0.6925305691107019
Let us, in particular, focus attention on the re-admission clauses, which present a threat to the Geneva Convention and which should be blocked.	0.8268225294480862
Unless we can maintain high standards of human rights with respect to refugees and asylum-seekers, we are not worthy of those European values which make up the European identity, as Vaclav Havel said here today, and among which he particularly mentioned respect for human rights and solidarity.	0.8314354536290037
I worked for many years on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it was really moving to see how a nation in such difficult circumstances was reaching out for a more open, European-style, pluralistic democratic society.	0.6863721193116901
I fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction, towards European exclusiveness and apartheid.	0.7911527002795959
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, the question which needs to be raised in Geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty.	0.7976831251982478
We have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in Geneva.	0.6876042837863793
We failed at the General Assembly last year on a fallacious pretext, I refer to article 2.7, which we are otherwise happy to adopt for all other texts.	0.8699456683926529
The question of the death penalty should therefore be raised at this year' s General Assembly, certainly not at the Geneva session.	0.7641078849727274
As Mr Patten said, and I would like to thank him for the positions which he defended, the crucial point is China.	0.9456873407504889
Unfortunately, the positions taken by the Commission and the Council, or at least the presidency, are more than just a hair' s breadth apart; this is serious, especially in the light of the Council' s macho position on Austria.	0.9303542338514756
In my view, as far as China is concerned, and knowing that the European Union' s policy towards China has been a total failure, allegedly constructive dialogue has got us nowhere or, worse, it has given the Chinese new pretexts for increasing repression and for strengthening religious repression and the repression of freedoms (as Mrs Wallström has said with regard to the Internet) in all sectors, in Tibet, in inland Mongolia, in eastern Turkistan.	0.824201507150939
There is regression in every sector of Chinese civil society.	0.29894822820067307
It is a fact: China is the major threat, the major threat to us, the threat which we must confront, the threat to peace.	1.1187206498672702
It is the antithesis of democracy and you know as well as I that the Chinese, the Chinese leadership, is Communist first and Chinese second.	0.857047695675138
China likes doublespeak.	0.07097262631100865
Until we have a firm position, we will achieve nothing with the Chinese authorities.	1.029023555028523
I think we need to seize the opportunity.	0.6872274000934475
We need to associate ourselves with the American initiative.	0.6215667318987311
We need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted.	0.7831460562554641
We need to work.	0.6876112344547594
The Fifteen need to start work right now, with all the members of the United Nations; we need, at long last, to issue a firm condemnation and then use that as a basis to gain a negotiating position.	0.8981256718895365
Mr President, I would like to try to put a different perspective to this.	0.6462934643292297
As you know, on Monday an unmanned spacecraft went into orbit around a peanut-shaped asteroid called Eros which is not very far from earth.	0.6260571127556281
Photographs show us that there is no life on the asteroid, but much further out in our galaxy, the Milky Way, there are about 300 billion stars, many with planets.	0.8444982294771568
Beyond the Milky Way there are 300 billion other galaxies with countless stars and planets.	0.2764030081921618
It is probable, therefore, that there is a lot of life out there, and much of it much more advanced than we are.	0.7869704950993912
Bearing in mind that the first television programmes from earth are now 50 light years out into space way beyond the nearest stars, I invite you to imagine with me what life out there in the stars thinks of us as they look at us.	0.6426151259254503
What do they see?	0.36553797139183175
They see a beautiful planet, teeming with life, but they see its atmosphere being polluted and warming up.	0.6580935938364975
They see forests being cut down and deserts spreading.	0.31098011058666775
Of the living creatures, they can see many animals that are treated cruelly, rare ones becoming extinct for ever.	0.5058089842734873
How do they see the currently dominant species - that is us?	0.8015452054297592
Well, they see the planet's resources being unevenly spread.	0.7233296446782178
They see land being fought over, medicine for disease but not in the parts of the world where it is most wanted, books for schools - but not at all in the least-developed areas of our world, 50% of the world's population never making a telephone call in their whole life.	0.8250755917652868
What do they see about the relationships between human beings?	0.41243215708217734
They see us killing each other.	0.41099702741253197
They see us restricting each other's liberties.	0.36165820892591727
They see a never-ending series of local wars. They see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers, or treated as prostitutes or slaves.	0.7041589554357439
They see unequal treatment of men and women, of people of different ages, of minorities, of people of different coloured skins, of races, of beliefs, of immigrants, even neighbours.	0.9891209659776109
We all know the picture.	0.6472589272276461
The UN Convention on Human Rights 50 years ago was an attempt to correct this.	0.4217896442707325
We should salute it - and I think we do.	0.916189657609158
Only in Europe are human rights enforceable in law.	0.4791081534812963
Here in the European Parliament some of the Members do not want the Charter of Rights, which is being discussed at the moment, to become enforceable in law.	1.1910174935662574
I say: shame on them!	0.33601452937805104
Human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world.	0.747257085703174
That is the goal which we have to work towards.	1.2277411622405963
Much, as Commissioner Patten said, remains to be done.	1.0055431807130704
Finally, if you asked me: What if there is no life out there among the stars, what if we are alone? - which is an equally awe-inspiring thought - I would say: Do not you think we have a responsibility too to make our children behave properly, before letting them go out to populate other planets?	1.0141317126670586
Mr President, human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated and interwoven.	0.5842954740928357
This well-known phrase, which is taken from the conclusions of the UN World Conference on human rights of 1993, is known off by heart by many.	0.8214212208277498
That is positive.	0.16961834761827216
But what about the human rights policy within the EU itself?	0.9070361229902432
Does it reflect this vision of coherence?	0.30146812678344
In fact, does the European Union have a human rights policy?	1.0698494693097016
This question does not challenge the efforts made by the Member States who wish to bring their viewpoints on foreign policy into line and to display a united front against violations of human rights elsewhere, for example in China.	0.7133710914418852
No, Mr President, I am talking about the lack of human rights policy within the European Union itself.	0.9248917482665087
A new government has come into power in Austria, comprising a political party which has sent out a message of racism and intolerance vis-à-vis minorities.	0.6307800304271756
Human rights, which the EU embraces, are thus under threat, but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated.	1.0020386626103073
The widely quoted Article 7 of the Treaty, which provides for the repeal of membership rights from a Member State where serious and continuous violations against human rights have been established, is, of course, only a kill or cure remedy, an ultimum remedium, which, in the case of Austria, can only be quoted in the absence of anything more effective, and by way of warning.	0.8180685864841173
There is, therefore a need for a fully-fledged human rights policy for and by the European Union, a policy which promotes and enforces human rights within the EU itself.	0.9647121863077541
Such policy should comprise various components.	0.22953598538164816
Firstly: a regulatory framework is needed, which spells out very clearly the rights which the EU intends to secure for its citizens.	0.731726109022041
A start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter, but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists.	0.7620018338141548
This is a political question which, in the short term, requires an answer from the IGC and this Parliament.	0.9533999511877352
Secondly: a range of instruments has to be developed which allow for a flexible response and which do not force us into a situation where we need to choose between a kill or cure remedy or a complete stab in the dark.	0.6503641444681345
The following spring to mind in this respect: the systematic collation of documentation and information, professional forms of observation, the development of information campaigns, the use of cash to support democratic forces in the country concerned, a more creative deployment of the resources which are available through multilateral diplomacy, such as organised dialogue and fact finding missions and such like.	0.744727564195673
Thirdly: it will need to be made clear for each of the EU institutions where the responsibility for human rights policy lies within the European Union and what the tasks and competences are that this entails.	1.0988016406713397
The Commission and the Council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be.	0.8190850018499684
This Parliament is excluded from this, for our Rules of Procedure stipulate that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs carries this responsibility.	0.841307376320694
But I am somewhat surprised that the resolution which should bring this debate on human rights to a conclusion has been prepared in the foreign sector of this Parliament and that the aforementioned Committee, of which I form part, has not been involved in this.	1.0067906380885403
Mr President, this Parliament is fragmented and divided.	0.9633958053306412
For the sake of our credibility, we will have to speak with one voice when it comes to human rights and not act as if human rights within the EU are different from human rights elsewhere in the world.	0.8288442492035613
I think that this will benefit our credibility in the UN Human Rights Committee.	0.8281024308695417
Mr President, what will it take to make the debate on human rights something other than what it is today: an ideological instrument which helps to enslave peoples rather than free individuals?	0.8110953685821713
We must start by going beyond man, who is not the master of the universe, to the source of all genuine rights and civilised values, without which the eternal claim to rights always ends in tyranny and bloodshed.	0.7859988778682933
We need, in the ancient and mediaeval tradition of Europe, to go back to the natural order of the universe, i.e. to the Creation, and beyond that still further, to the Creator' s intention.	0.9371798138284743
Then we shall see that the rights of the child are only respected within a proper family, the rights of workers are only respected in the intermediary bodies which we have recently destroyed and that citizens' rights are only respected within sovereign states.	0.8332657948553094
Secondly, the doctrine of human rights must no longer be exploited, as it is today, as an instrument of ideological warfare in the hands of a cast which claims the right to decree unilaterally who is to be the arbiter of human rights and who is to be deprived of those rights, thereby denying the legitimacy and, if need be, the freedom of those whom the party line has deemed politically incorrect.	0.9967471948390236
'No freedom for the enemies of freedom' was what the advocates of the revolutionary Terror were saying two centuries ago, the advocates of the revolution which proved, alas, to be the mother of all modern totalitarian regimes.	0.629407071101922
No human rights for the enemies of human rights is what the acolytes of the new world order are saying today, the new world order which reigns almost unchallenged in financial circles, in international institutions, in the media and cultural networks, and in educational institutions, to mention but a few.	1.0043622733553834
What is left, for example, of the right of Austrians to choose their own destiny, if that choice is dictated on their behalf by those who decide what should or should not be done and if their duly and legally elected leaders are received in an insulting manner, as they were recently by you in Portugal, Mr President of the Council.	0.8340730060297163
I do not know if he is still present and can hear me.	0.7107165721915054
What is left of the human rights of those who sympathise with the Vlaamsblok, one of the most important parties in the Flemish region, if tomorrow the Belgian Parliament adopts the implausible, indecent and ignominious bill tabled by its main political rivals, the Volksunie, which seeks quite simply to abolish the party?	0.6973263620918438
What is left of the right to engage in a critical study of history when authors and publishers are persecuted, as the young historian Jean Plantin was just yesterday before the Court of Appeal, in my home town of Lyon - he was the subject of an absurd, arrogant and offensive closing speech by the public prosecutor Jean-Olivier Viout, the smug expression of straitjacketed thinking and intellectual conformism?	0.7404566932278573
It is a strange concept of human rights when peaceful patriotism is fraudulently equated with aggressive nationalism, when legitimate protests against immigration policies are equated with I do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identities is equated with racism.	0.6352338512891313
What of the human rights of the millions of French people who voted for the National Front and who are deprived of any political representation and vilified daily, as they were on Monday on the television channels of the state to which they are required to pay taxes, when the simple expression of justifiably exasperated views by one of our colleagues, Mr Le Pen, is used as a pretext for iniquitous condemnation, in violation of the law and in violation of all notions of justice, fairness and morals, and when attempts are made, in violation of the clearest legislation, to deprive this representative of millions of our fellow citizens of the mandate which he has been given by their vote, not received as a favour from the government.	0.8764818630568254
In a word, I shall believe your talk about human rights in Europe, fellow Members, when you acknowledge that your political opponents have the same rights as you allow yourselves.	0.8510234047453094
I shall believe your talk about human rights in China when you name the real cause of the problem, i.e. Communism.	0.6105321766212775
Listen to the resounding voice of Solzhenitsyn in his letter to the Americans, in which he says that the main cause of the weakness of Western society is excessive pandering to legal individualism, an individualism which, far from allowing people to flourish, paves the way for future dictatorship, in fact the worst kind of dictatorship, because those whom it enslaves are not even aware of their terrible servitude.	0.8373377422343927
Mr President, the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political legacies of the 20th century.	0.7641108402539433
The holocaust, fifty years ago, led to the need to lay down a number of fundamental rights and freedoms.	0.6966060387860723
Since the end of the cold war, compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation.	0.6429865534744532
Leaders violating these principles now face international criticism, sanctions and are even brought to trial, such as ex-dictators like Mr Pinochet have experienced.	0.4732338741207597
These developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very disquieting.	0.9003877925240681
Especially in situations of war, civilians are given less consideration all the time.	0.4276232596914836
It seems contradictory.	0.16888468760308178
Never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed.	0.36146646663286713
Never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries.	0.47919118077590667
Yet the most basic rules of conduct are being flouted on a massive scale and there are more civilian victims than there were a century ago.	0.6562721730345559
Women are systematically raped.	0.1861224435554431
Children are conscripted by force and deployed in battle.	0.26721401296245945
Excesses are no longer the exception, they have unfortunately become the rule.	0.727318589509101
This applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide.	0.30524748660209167
Too late, too selective and too fragmented: this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community.	0.9292093913401195
First of all, the policy comes too late.	0.6653085139202832
Both in Rwanda and Kosovo, the UN, despite the many warnings, appeared to be overtaken by events and stood by as a helpless observer of the massacres, as President Havel pointed out this afternoon.	0.6757983957474075
Fifty years later, we are still unable to prevent genocide.	0.8828921731162818
We should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency.	0.6119217420196117
Control of the arms trade and improved media control are essential in this.	0.5086153407778198
The human rights policy is also too selective.	0.7223384203574558
The months of NATO bombardments of Kosovo and the mediation attempts in the Middle East are in stark contrast to international apathy with regard to the conflicts in Africa.	0.5072107241640906
I cannot shake off the impression that, when it comes to human rights, despite all the rhetoric, Africa does not feature on top of the agenda of the Portuguese Presidency. This is something which I very much regret.	0.8896144992442261
The impression that Africans get, namely that they are inferior world citizens, is not unfounded.	0.9204361637918801
I would like to warn against a blurring of standards in the assessment of human rights situations in Africa, where violations are viewed as a necessary evil.	0.652498242740009
But above all, the human rights policy is too fragmented.	0.7906138162652621
We are unable to draft a common strategy within the international communities or Europe.	0.44219406904893993
Take Sudan.	-0.0
The international community is sending conflicting messages to this country.	0.5630554323335465
Britain has re-opened its embassy in Khartoum.	0.18962634975791207
Canada has invited the Sudanese for peace talks.	0.20220982900868428
Europe puts the rebels in the South under pressure to negotiate and at the same time, Americans isolate the regime and support the rebels at military level.	0.499858511027033
There is a need for more coordination, more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raised bids are avoided.	0.8288850227359752
Only then can we follow in the footsteps of the founders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.	0.49195406675873604
Mr President, I would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home.	0.7149487557442166
But unfortunately, as we speak today in the safety of this Chamber, human rights abuses are occurring throughout the free world.	0.8806570021156287
Sometimes the more we speak, the less we hear - motions: words; conventions: words; treaties: words - if we are not careful, words themselves become a substitute for real action.	0.7627896485389425
Words framed in inclusive and liberating documents become treaties and conventions which are often paraded as a testimony to a country's respect for and adherence to human rights.	0.43247704118934754
Yet words spoken, written or signed are not in themselves enough.	0.49837437784828914
Look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities, groups and individuals - the list is shameful and shaming.	0.6893178312548844
Can anyone argue with any persuasiveness that women are treated equally and fairly, that children have human rights or that people are not discriminated against because of their religion, belief, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, opinion, political affiliation etc?	0.5864929672284734
The defamation of minorities in newspapers and other media fuels discrimination.	0.34532343170980623
Even within the EU citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions.	0.6476245251108822
Every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation are used to deny some minorities equality before the law and to denigrate ethnic minorities.	0.5601926301309001
Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created.	0.36740895044567645
And so long as people do not have equality before the law, this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded.	0.8050150850248161
In our enlargement process in the EU we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities.	0.895940728934826
We must not waiver in that commitment.	0.6143648850415917
But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies.	0.6196875435671988
Yes, conventions have been signed, but action is needed.	0.7224452009683001
I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices, eternal vigilance, not just outside our borders but within.	0.6207153531941322
That is why I would welcome an annual Member State report from each individual state which would have to record any charges against it and the action taken. Because what happens in each Member State happens to every single one of us.	0.7647374476031518
What happens in another part of the world affects us.	0.792928126484961
Pinochet in Chile is as relevant as Haider in Austria.	0.2491710739613275
Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked.	0.5149674900648922
Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are connected to our development policies, our economic policies, our home affairs policies, indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions.	0.9166494067395924
I would repeat what Mr Patten said: we must engage, we must inform, educate and thereby effect real and lasting change.	0.8465524219958782
Mr President, "Europe stands for ideals, values and principles.	0.6746256930438579
We must emphasise Europe' s spiritual history.	0.4700647608515001
Together, we must re-establish the values which unite Europe.	0.8481231200664024
Spiritual values have been disseminated from Europe throughout the globe.	0.28942825779774844
We must live with our consciences."	0.36605502272575885
These were the words spoken three hours ago in this Chamber by the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel.	0.6397243993324605
In an extraordinarily edifying speech, characterised by wisdom, historical knowledge, an understanding of the human heart and insight into Europe' s spiritual and Christian heritage, he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity.	0.6623429685379398
We should be grateful that there are Heads of State like Vaclav Havel in our Europe.	0.7504510643760925
I wish to discuss two matters.	0.3847552248684831
First of all, civil society.	0.48548208641395685
Vaclav Havel stated that, in Eastern Europe, the Communist regimes methodically destroyed civil society: national movements, churches and the independent trade unions.	0.6869872366895655
The same is happening in China in connection with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches.	0.6369037542944826
It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet.	0.4296309819989773
We must never forget to defend civil society.	0.30676084523347613
I also want to mention the death penalty.	0.6089501496936209
Like my own country, Sweden, the EU bases its view of human beings upon the equal, unique and inviolable value of every human.	0.6950939564583685
On the basis of this principle, human beings should always have the chance to redeem themselves.	0.7844128940614067
Try telling that to the governments of the United States, Russia and China.	0.6127085216843997
Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, I believe the approach of EU Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situations in Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and China.	0.7076041718822412
In relation to China, we should not be dissuaded from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked.	0.7901171161406343
However, it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts as one, and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve.	0.7801620916457582
However, if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at Geneva, then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be provided with the necessary resources.	1.1631023105817242
The financial resources of the United Nations are spread very thinly and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat.	0.5813115544192327
Resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights, strategic planning, the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the United Nations.	0.6685664013032927
To this end the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks.	0.5726449728980856
The European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds.	0.7864289340003446
In so doing, we would not only embarrass the United States into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to UN funding, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric.	0.9078212309190197
Mr President, this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual UN Human Rights Convention and the Commission' s and Council' s efforts in this respect.	0.9544550771710893
I would first of all like to say that I am very pleased with the contributions made by Mr Patten and the Minister, and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba are on the agenda.	0.9623750911171356
Cuba is the last stronghold of dictatorship in South America and we must be mindful of this, with all due sympathy to Cuba.	0.8471944639606999
It is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy.	0.5980958584231314
I would, during my two minutes, like to draw attention to two countries which are close to my heart.	0.7977406005830128
The first country is Indonesia.	0.26900554992774933
We are naturally delighted that Indonesia is under new rule and that Mr Wahid and Mrs Sukarnoputri are the new President and Vice-President.	0.5484282131552168
We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction.	0.7863703959225494
But I can report that in the Moluccas, an area just north of Timor, the violence is still not under control.	0.8984936862616739
This has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years.	0.4569021551831931
Tens of thousands of people are on the run.	0.6644630079978635
The situation is badly managed.	0.5655262043295121
I know that tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, an important programme will be shown on Dutch television, in which an appeal will be made for observers. This is with the sole purpose of monitoring what exactly is going on, so that at least a record can be made, not least for the future, for human rights committees, of what has been happening.	1.1168610333508728
My urgent request, which has been echoed many times in resolutions, is the following: could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the Moluccas?	0.7721775648815803
Surely thousands of people killed, thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough.	0.46452826808612263
My second country - I will be brief as Mr Patten knows this country very well - is Burma.	0.8873182060637362
Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma.	0.48380481839288614
I have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion.	0.6777914045156974
For ten years now, the elected President of that country has been under house arrest.	0.7310041609981923
And for ten years now, its parliament has been out of action.	0.7042533669589969
Numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma.	0.5795487978233055
There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention.	0.6582898024868766
In my opinion, Burma should be put back on the agenda, too, certainly in the wake of Indonesia' s U-turn.	0.6463531425469617
Surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch, even by Europe.	0.5915123602479142
My request is, in fact, to put this country back on the top of the agenda.	0.9604101979272999
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, economic clout cannot be the only factor that determines the European Union' s status in the world.	0.7337519524790657
One of the EU' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights, as exercised both within the Union and by our partners.	0.8414948286086269
The European Parliament has been at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human rights, and it has succeeded in overcoming the limits imposed by self-interest and "national interests" , which are sometimes reflected in the positions adopted by the Member States and even by other European Union institutions.	0.9284776783220835
We can therefore safely say, for example, that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten, which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people, who always opposed occupation by Indonesia.	0.9306624500859678
By the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia, a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account.	0.8110738911992521
But it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position.	0.5948639147991343
It is vital that when violations are committed, the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity, whoever or wherever they may be - in Indonesia or Angola, in Cuba, China or Burma, whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers, humble foot-soldier or general or even a minister.	0.7677749582301051
Justice needs to be done in Indonesia.	0.7970156186861517
Justice needs to be done in East Timor.	0.812138151525683
President Wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with.	0.5019740867063568
The specific reference in this resolution to East Timor, on the initiative of the PPE Group, is a timely one.	0.870260295862638
Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there, some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House; they cannot go unpunished.	0.8195444032556128
It is impossible to talk about East Timor without mentioning the tens of thousands of Timorese refugees living on Indonesian soil in inhumane conditions, under the control of Indonesian soldiers and militias, and being used as bargaining chips.	0.577370426343058
This is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency.	0.6609622122961252

(PT) Mr President, I would like to make a few very brief comments on behalf of the Council presidency, and first to remind you that the work done by the presidency is above all about coordination and about seeking common positions on initiatives that the fifteen Member States are to approve in the Council. Our experience of previous sessions of the Human Rights Commission suggests - precisely by virtue of this coordinating role played by successive presidencies - that the European Union is very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the Commission, and it is important to maintain this.	0.9264027557097828
I would also like to say that the European Parliament' s participation in the preparatory work is important in establishing coherent European Union positions on various different issues, and that the presidency therefore naturally welcomes all the various suggestions and in particular all the contributions made through the resolutions which have been presented.	0.9041435840765637
I would also like to stress, as many Members have highlighted, that human rights policy is at the heart of Europe' s identity and that respect for human rights should be seen as a fundamental principle for international cooperation by the European Union.	0.9373306466192743
Hence the need for the most coherent European human rights policy possible, which of course means that we need to adopt clear and unambiguous positions where we consider a state of affairs to be unacceptable, and I have in mind, in particular, the references that many Members have made to China.	1.009134114964333
But we have also duly noted the concerns expressed by many other Members about other countries, notably Indonesia, East Timor, the Moluccas and Burma.	0.7906799426404879
I could not conclude without mentioning Mr Van Hecke' s speech in particular, in which he referred to the human rights situation in Africa and to the role and priorities of the Portuguese Presidency, and questioned the sincerity of the priority we are giving to relations with the European Union.	0.9133785001306587
I would simply like to say that the Portuguese Presidency has, in these two short months, organised the first Development Council, admittedly an informal one, whose agenda was rightly dominated by EU-Africa relations. Indeed it was this subject which led the development ministers of the fifteen Member States to meet in Lisbon for discussions specifically on the new era these relations have entered.	0.814586782371046
Furthermore, I cannot stress enough the significance of our having concluded important negotiations on the new convention to succeed the Lomé Convention, and the fact that, following extremely complex and difficult negotiations, we have succeeded in organising - or making preparations for the organisation of - the first EU-Africa Summit.	1.0294230387544285
For all these reasons I thought it essential to reply directly to Mr Van Hecke' s question on this issue.	0.731042881535054
. Mr President, this has been a very useful debate.	1.0681033951535348
One or two speeches have referred to specific issues which we are well advised to think about very carefully.	0.7686593258358061
For example, Mrs Maij-Weggen referred to both Indonesia and Burma and made some important points about both those countries and the human rights situation there.	0.674301511153797
What I would like to focus on very briefly are one or two themes which ran through our debate.	0.5612954029619508
One of the very first speakers, Mr Wuori, spoke of the remarks made earlier today by Mr Havel.	0.8700917992520587
It was a remarkable speech and I hope that Mr Gollnisch, who is no longer able to be with us, was able to hear that speech as well.	0.9071176742511933
I also hope that, if there is any life in outer space, as has been speculated by Mr Newton Dunn, it was tuned in to Mr Havel' s speech as well.	0.8761680696884975
Mr Havel reminded us that the Union is not just about markets, about GDP growth, it is a Union of values that is reflected in the Treaties and is reflected in our obligations in the whole area of external assistance, reflected quite specifically in what we are charged to do.	0.9705664647574344
How do we implement what the Treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes?	0.5690507793033865
One or two honourable Members, Mr Ferber and Mr Cushnahan, spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality.	0.6232887930161637
Mr Cashman said, which is right in a sense, that words are no substitute for real action.	0.7694666760906185
Of course, words can make a bit of a difference, a point that was made by Mrs Malmström.	0.9084377757898047
She said that she had received a letter from the Chinese Ambassador, a very amiable and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country, to tell her that she was wrong and the European Parliament was wrong in its attitude on human rights in China.	0.8604746012728305
I think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letters from the Chinese authorities.	0.45533529326430533
She will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in China.	0.6038724149695104
I think she was reflecting the views of many non-governmental organisations, many people who admire Chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in China today.	0.7292608232015435
Of course it is entirely right that we have to look at action, and the very first speech by Mr Salafranca mentioned two issues apart from Geneva which represent actions, one of which is of course made possible by the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of the European taxpayer - that is the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - about EUR 100 million that is spent through programmes, for which I am responsible, mainly going to non-governmental organisations to promote human rights and to promote democratisation.	1.031167738323833
We will want to share with Parliament, as vicars say, our views on how that spending programme to support human rights can be best focused and best targeted in the years ahead.	0.7115055143489893
There is also the question which was referred to by Mr Salafranca, who I am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate.	0.8774157088741579
There is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy.	0.9727211202022761
I want to remind Parliament that the Commission will be publishing, before the middle of the year, a comprehensive, intellectual case for placing human rights at the heart of the development of the common foreign and security policy.	0.9302032518145457
It is immensely important, and if I had not thought that already, having listened to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion.	0.8433283215119481
It has been a useful debate.	0.8788652685111599
I hope we can have further debates like this.	0.5978395484255427
I hope we can have, in particular, debates about some of the ways in which we translate these good intentions into practice on the ground where it matters, where people are still being tortured, where people are still being raped and are still being denied the sort of civil rights that this House takes for granted, as I do.	0.8915616944666259
I have received 7 motions for resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2), to close the present statement.	0.6631675815567809
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place on Thursday.	0.408151749683539
Cyprus and Malta	-0.0
The next item is the joint debate on:	0.3634074049513851
the Council statement on the position of the European Union on developments concerning Cyprus;	0.8276065616877023
the report (A4-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta [COM(1999)0535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)].	0.5525659271226925
Mr Seixas da Costa has the floor on behalf of the Council.	0.5564529762622402
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I would like to present to you certain information about the re-opening of the intra-Cyprus negotiations and recent developments in this area.	0.7452122838472586
I think it will be obvious to everyone that the events in Helsinki at the end of last year and the new era in relations between the European Union and Turkey have created a new backdrop, at Community level, which we cannot ignore when it comes to relations between the two Cypriot communities.	0.9945656242773971
At the beginning of December 1999, the first round of negotiations were held in New York, after an interruption of several years in negotiations between the Cypriot communities in the north and south of the island.	0.8648770964282086
These negotiations took the form of indirect discussions mediated by the UN special representative, Álvaro de Soto.	0.42608269725807946
A further round was held in January this year, starting on 31 January, and a third round is scheduled to start on 23 May in New York.	0.7405092630984029
There is a possibility, which has not yet been absolutely confirmed, that continuous and direct discussions may take place, with work continuing until September this year.	0.936234764451946
These discussions essentially cover four areas: security, the structure of government, territorial adjustments and issues relating to refugees and compensation, as a result of the situation following the partition of the island.	0.7453836065819254
However, agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues, and the representative of the northern part of the island, Rauf Denktash, has suggested three new topics: sovereignty, confidence-building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island.	0.7658930425572577
The discussions held so far have essentially resulted in two developments. The first is the possibility of opening up a direct information channel between the European Union and the north of the island, without this necessarily signifying recognition of this part of the island as a legal personality at international level, but as a means of facilitating adoption of the acquis communautaire with a view to eventual accession of the whole island, if a solution can, in the meantime, be found to the broader problem of the partition of the island.	0.885792308228451
The second development which we regard as important is the statement made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the end of the first day' s discussions to the effect that an overall settlement of the situation would involve recognition of the specific situation of the north of the island.	0.8113286405643784
This is the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis.	0.9354057543559139
Certain expectations exist about the third round of negotiations, in view of the proposed scenarios being prepared with the involvement of representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom, in particular in the areas of security and the constitutional structure, which it is envisaged will be presented at this round through the good offices of the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.	0.869086707357808
This will take place after the election in the north of the island scheduled for 18 April.	0.6929034377615423
Furthermore, the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has decided, following the example of previous presidencies, to appoint a representative to establish contacts with the various parties involved in this issue.	0.989182635642146
This representative has already contacted all these parties and has, in close cooperation with the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, been monitoring and assisting with the work of the various rounds.	0.7860437383966097
In particular, we intend that the European Union should maintain a constant profile on this issue, and of course all the more so since Cyprus is a candidate for membership of the European Union with negotiations at a fairly advanced stage. This naturally raises certain expectations and means that the role of the European Union is of some relevance in this context.	0.9410716886637475
The approach that we have been following in these discussions, and our participation in them, essentially turns on taking advantage of a certain desire to alleviate the tensions that exist, based on a conviction - which appears to be widely shared - that it is necessary to continue to negotiate, and that continuing negotiations and maintaining their impetus also give rise to hopes that a definitive solution can be found.	0.8746482570902291
There is also another important aspect which I referred to at the beginning of my statement, and this relates to Turkey' s role in helping the north of the island to prepare for accession.	0.9096567447355964
We believe that it is not only necessary to read the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council with some care and attention, but that we should also take advantage of the willingness of the Turkish authorities to help to resolve this situation.	1.0253018158866538
I was able to talk to Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit about this issue when I visited Ankara myself, and although we are aware of the difficulties and sensitivity associated with Turkey' s particular approach to this question, I believe that there is a window of opportunity that we must not miss.	0.8772357014725845
This window of opportunity involves combining various factors, one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union.	0.885667448002853
This is key as regards the future of this issue.	0.849205271654947
On the other hand, we think it is important - and this is also linked with the way in which the European Union relates to the heart of this matter - that an exchange of information between the Commission and the Cypriots in the north of the island should be encouraged. This would not, let me make this quite clear, imply any kind of formal recognition.	1.0138829227676045
Nevertheless, we believe, and I think this is also how the Commission sees things, that the whole process of approximation with the acquis communautaire with a view to overall integration of the island in the European Union through accession at some point in the future implies involving the communities in the north of the island as soon as possible. It may also give the European Union access to data enabling it to justify accession, as part of its efforts to assess accession conditions.	1.0361807028123267
Furthermore, this means that we in the Council - and I think that Parliament will join us in this - should encourage the Commission' s involvement in this undertaking.	1.0218239791759522
It is essential for us to send the Commission a message of confidence about its role in this area.	0.958936482235557
Lastly, I believe - and this is also the presidency' s intention - that we should continue to cooperate actively with the United Nations, given the skilful, intelligent and capable way in which the Secretary-General, and the UN organisation in general, have conducted these discussions, and in particular the way they have endeavoured to help to harmonise the two parties' positions.	1.0222916835950069
As I said at the beginning, the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council last December have had a visible impact on the way the positions of the various parties to this process have developed.	0.9675683981028225
The Nicosia Government has expressed its satisfaction with the Helsinki conclusions, which open up the way to accession to the European Union without solving the partition of the island beforehand.	0.8237221599562562
Nevertheless, I have to say that the same authorities have expressed their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issues raised by partition, which will evidently imply some concessions.	0.9160528575090353
This is related to developments in the sphere of displaced people and the possibility of a new arrangement regarding displaced people should a different solution be found for the island.	0.6828680052470574
On the other hand, the Turkish Cypriots fear - and there is no point in trying to conceal this - that Turkey' s application for membership of the European Union may lead to greater flexibility in Ankara' s position on this.	0.8999466485048657
I believe that, despite the fears that may be felt by the two communities on the island, these points, which could be viewed in a negative light by the authorities on both sides, may in the end justify hopes of an ultimate solution.	0.9083448126536257
It is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present, which is the extremely positive trend in relations between Athens and Ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the Greek Foreign Minister, Giorgios Papandreou, and the Turkish Foreign Minister, Ismail Cem.	0.8699669575518679
We believe that this has created the framework for a positive outcome.	0.9826555046392377
As far as we, the Council presidency, are concerned, we will continue to follow these developments very closely, and we will certainly cooperate with the Secretary-General and his personal representative on this matter.	1.1245951109777623
We will make the Community institutions aware of what we are able to do, and what is possible in general, as regards coordination, not just at political level but also as regards what the Commission itself can achieve in terms of its scope for managing the accession process.	1.0660818569390336
In particular, we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue.	0.8192325472218049
Mr President, we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations.	1.2092327459552061
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate the sensitivity with which you are addressing the issue and your effort to establish contact with the Turkish Cypriot side, but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use did not leave one suspecting that you might be attempting some kind of indirect recognition, even though you stressed that this is not the case.	0.8039954448318317
For example, I would not refer to the government of Nicosia.	1.072306052141703
It is the Cypriot Government, Mr President-in-Office, not the government of Nicosia.	0.9415705868914733
That government has proposed a way in which the Turkish Cypriot side can take part, and I think it would be right for the Council and the Commission to urge the Turkish Cypriot side to take part institutionally in the framework of the negotiations conducted by the Republic of Cyprus.	0.9883681973753767
On the other hand, the way that the issue of the end of the protocols and the pre-accession strategy has been addressed so far creates some doubts for us.	0.8052824530049407
I cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently, nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies.	0.6168110325326149
Nor can I understand the pressure applied by Parliament to include the funds in Chapter 7 for the pre-accession strategy. How can the whole of the European Union treat, in this way, two small countries situated on its periphery?	0.8819776039763184
Not only are they countries which the European Union needs, but they are also countries which are fully qualified to operate within the Union and are already considered capable of participating in economic and monetary union.	0.927415914238843
As the Commissioner said, and I agree with him, it is a matter of political decision.	1.2692468619084838
This is a small political decision which would bring major benefits, especially in helping the two communities effectively to constitute one state, to achieve effective rapprochement - because the two communities were once close - and for the Republic of Cyprus, genuinely, to be rid of occupying forces.	0.9832142769558861
Mr President, we are required under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations within the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta.	0.7139202373494229
This proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and, once it is implemented, will replace the financial protocols which have now expired.	0.8610647021430445
Pre-accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the Community acquis.	0.7932861771831997
The Commission' s analysis has in fact shown that, although classified as high income countries by the World Bank, Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity.	0.6434968619129263
It was pointed out, during the discussion of Mr Brok' s excellent report in committee, that both countries can also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest.	0.7236474122392726
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could explicitly confirm that.	0.5673181814547533
As far as Cyprus is concerned, part of the technical and financial aid provided for in the instruments will be used to bring the Greek and Turkish communities closer together and solve the problem of the partition of the island once and for all.	0.7378304929404131
The declarations made on the Cyprus question by the Council and the Commission were therefore most opportune and I should like to thank the President of the Council and Commissioner Verheugen.	0.9928757572671076
Since 4 July 1990, when Cyprus applied to join the EU, the European Parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.	0.9090632864017824
In April 1999, Parliament again reiterated its position that the accession of Cyprus should benefit the whole island, and help towards a political solution, but that accession should not be dependent upon such a solution.	0.8966393566291312
In other words, accession should not be held hostage to a political solution.	0.6612780965075116
The two processes are separate processes.	0.34048574248950175
This unequivocal position on the part of the European Parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy.	0.8150903789686484
We must therefore welcome the fact that the Helsinki European Council put an end to the speculation and stated in its conclusions, and I quote, that "If no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations, the Council' s decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition" .	0.8860025516297341
The position is clear and we must now hope that the improved climate surrounding relations between the European Union and Turkey and between Greece and Turkey will bear favourably on the Turkish Cypriot community and that it will withdraw its refusal to send representatives to the accession negotiations.	0.8476618805825126
The presence of these representatives will not prejudge the final political solution in any way whatsoever.	0.5781251600732112
On the contrary, it will allow the interests of all concerned to be highlighted as and when Cyprus joins the European Union and prepares for a turning point in its history.	0.8651313358285139
Mr President, I want to say that I share the other rapporteurs' delight at the fact that better opportunities are now to be glimpsed for making further progress in Cyprus in the light of the improvement in relations between Turkey and the EU and between Turkey and Greece.	0.7433729863359055
However, I also think that we in the EU should be making a constructive contribution.	1.3895240050193296
I also think - as has already been mentioned - that there are certain problems with the financing arrangements, which we must solve.	1.2066551021703344
There is, of course, the question of pre-accession aid, and this belongs in category seven.	0.9190709209609804
Last year, Parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four, and the two applicant States are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant States from Central and Eastern Europe, as they, in fact, should be, according to the declarations from the Helsinki Summit.	0.856161085647477
Resources should therefore be set aside from category seven, where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out.	0.8542230887454253
This is the crux of the matter.	0.5902234316075766
The main point is that the money for Cyprus' s and Malta' s pre-accession aid should come from category seven and that there should be a review of the financial perspectives for, if the Council does not endorse this view, it is in reality acting in conflict with its own decisions in Helsinki in December.	0.9339599346112935
With regard to the amount which is quoted in the Brok report (EUR 130 million), I also want to say, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, that we must negotiate our way towards finding a sum of money.	0.7875821278734884
The most important thing is that a multi-annual programme be guaranteed, and in the correct category, so that it might be possible to begin making plans where Cyprus and Malta are concerned.	0.8972087127883367
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support the decision adopted by the European Council in Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot be a prior condition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.	0.8279539943947168
We should continue to exert strong pressure on the Government of Cyprus, but one section of the population cannot blackmail the wish of the majority. Besides, we have strong doubts as to how representative the government is of that part of the island is.	0.9441090115631333
It is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full.	0.6460607731096801
But we are also convinced that, despite improved relations between the Turkish and Greek populations, it is not enough.	0.9469089549216642
The conflict in Cyprus will only be resolved through improved relations between the two communities with a view to establishing a federation in the - we hope - not too distant future.	0.8340039099001456
In particular, we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of demilitarising and disarming the island.	0.8319201923326797
The European Union should be taking a more decisive role that goes further than merely providing financial support, although that is important, by promoting and guaranteeing reconciliation between the two communities through the setting up of fora and confidence-building programmes.	0.8137144771734434
I must say that Alex Langer's presence here in the European Parliament is sadly missed. His efforts to build peace should serve as an example, to all of us, on how peaceful coexistence can be achieved.	0.8931950512688895
Mr President, the reference to dialogue between the two Cypriot communities under the aegis of the UNO reminds us of the fact that, 26 years after the invasion of the island by the Turkish army, nearly 40% of the territory is still occupied by 35 000 soldiers, heavy weaponry is still being used and over 50 000 colonists are still present, in total violation of the resolutions by the Security Council of the United Nations on this matter.	0.7383206150609802
What can the European Union do, without interfering in internal affairs in Cyprus, to promote a fair and viable solution to this drastic problem in a country which has been associated with the European Community for nearly 30 years and which is due to join the Union within the next few years?	1.0442105974062441
I have listened to the somewhat equivocal talk and silences on the part of the Council which, in my view, need clarifying.	0.7008305663281961
I think that we need, first and foremost, to bear the main point of reference for any international community in such cases in mind, i.e. the resolutions of the United Nations.	0.915078431362029
The Security Council feels that the solution to the Cypriot problem should be sought within the framework of a two-zone, twin-community federation, in other words a single state, as Mr Verheugen mentioned, consisting of two local administrations elected by the two communities.	0.7755323950210826
Cyprus should be one sovereign state, with a single international personality and single citizenship and this state should be demilitarised.	0.6604413040339233
The international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force.	0.5426412781658
Secondly, the European Union stands to gain, in my view, by minimising the scope for interpretation of the position laid down by the Helsinki European Council.	0.8573668235860185
The solution to the Cypriot problem cannot be a precondition to Cyprus' s accession to the Union, as Mr Poos has reminded us.	0.785903310551327
If it were, Turkey would have a sort of right of veto over the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, which is, of course, unacceptable.	0.778764948318462
Thirdly, we must not, in turn, allow the position taken by the Helsinki European Council to temper our efforts to resolve the Cypriot question before Cyprus joins the Union.	0.8458209823832902
From this point of view, the other decision taken at Helsinki, namely to grant Turkey candidate status, gives the Fifteen new responsibilities as well as new possibilities and its dialogue with Ankara can and, in my view, should, include a determination to ensure that Turkey demonstrates a constructive attitude towards dialogue between the two Cypriot communities which respects international law and which will ultimately lead to a united Cyprus and peace in the eastern Mediterranean.	0.7879858077541769
Mr President, there is a general consensus of opinion that financial aid to Cyprus and Malta is important.	0.7132604550496041
The big question, however, is from what budget heading should this aid be financed?	0.595205693014647
The Council and Commission have suggested deleting the protocols under category 4.	0.6459110411201266
This is in line with the budget order issued by Parliament in December last.	0.7266691011394251
The rapporteur is now making reference to this and proposes classing Cyprus and Malta under category 7.	0.6434749793163219
The Committee on Budgetary Control has even suggested postponing approval of the Brok report until the Council agrees to increase the financial ceilings for category 7.	0.5545078727553145
This is an extremely risky strategy.	0.8762536502602414
In fact, the financial protocols cannot go ahead without a vote in Parliament.	0.7787337653748624
Cyprus and Malta will thus become the victims of a political game between the Council and Parliament regarding the height of the ceilings.	0.7229137508846962
Moreover, what is the real significance of financial ceilings if they are increased for every new action?	0.8032943617066183
I would therefore advocate that the EUR 15 million in category 4 be dropped, in line with the Commission' s proposal.	0.8065697962334969
A multiannual budget of the Commission later on in the year, may give a decisive answer regarding credits for the coming years.	0.8490197768753415
Mr President, all over the world work is being done to resolve long-standing conflicts and bring together communities divided by history and by old tribal enmities and hatreds.	0.6345087570944826
Now is the time to devote our time and energy to aiding Cypriots from both sides of the "green line" in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long.	0.6252646527515613
We all know that special care is needed to ensure that Cyprus is brought successfully into the European Union, and the decisions taken at Helsinki give an added dimension to this debate, with the acceptance of Turkey as a candidate country.	0.8050284308710131
I hope that the decisions taken at Helsinki lead to progress on the Cyprus issue.	0.702030420745904
I hope this signals a new era of hope for Cyprus.	0.6264976379014234
I hope that Turkey begins to play a constructive role in the Cyprus issue.	0.6749439617843136
I am delighted to hear the words of support from the Council and the Commission for the UN and the work it is doing in encouraging proximity talks between the two communities to encourage reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between the two communities in Cyprus.	0.983273123882661
I very much welcome the Commission's support for that bizonal, bicommunal, federal Cyprus for which the UN has campaigned for so long and which both the Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish Cypriot side should be working hard to bring about.	0.7501591926994852
I welcome the renewed warmth in relations between the Greek Government and the Turkish Government.	0.8241750958889419
I hope that has an encouraging effect on the Cyprus talks.	0.7139216687146076
I hope that the accession money available to assist Cyprus is used partly to promote that reconciliation and rebuilding of trust and that both sides of the divided communities in Cyprus accept and use that money in the spirit in which it is given.	0.6972525633864409
We all, throughout the European institutions - in Parliament, the Council and the Commission - should be doing our best to aid Cyprus in its quest to reach a peaceful solution which brings together these two communities which have been divided for too many years.	0.8968933913250932
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, the regulation on accession aid is not exactly an advertisement for coherent work on the part of the Commission.	0.8140028245379997
Rather, the way in which these aid measures have been cobbled together smacks of amateurism to me.	0.5484952507545403
This applies both in terms of the substance and the financial aspect.	0.6747720603757857
In my view, it will hardly enable us to present the accession activities conducted by the Union to the citizens of Cyprus and Malta as evidence of the fact that it is worth their while joining.	0.9753174446882336
As Vaclav Havel rightly said today, the European Union will be judged on its political qualities according to what it can do for the individual.	0.8566401426422657
As far as the citizens are concerned, it is what a regulation can do for them that matters.	0.857766269305837
We will not exactly win any awards with this regulation as far as that is concerned.	0.6354804592125696
It is makeshift and contains heteronomous paragraphs, which is no way to set a shining example.	0.7110982779822125
The quality of an aid package is assessed according to the following criteria: is it decentralised, is it transparent, is it accessible to the citizens and does it work?	0.9350070291854637
Nonetheless, as far as the divided island of Cyprus is concerned, overall, this pre-accession strategy is bound up with a major political challenge.	0.8749867426827989
In my view, it is the task of the European Union to employ all instruments, including this one, so as to contribute towards resolving the conflict on the island by political means.	0.9193093631042333
I must take this opportunity to say that it is precisely the amendment submitted by the European Parliament that is so important to me in this respect.	1.0608978033379923
Both the Commission and the Council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well.	0.7862681507054542
I am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect.	1.0950904288899097
I believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in Cyprus before admitting this country to the European Union.	0.7776893606545165
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the view of the Greek Communist Party is that the main problem of Cyprus is not its accession to the European Union but the occupation of 40% of its territory by Turkey, which has continued for 26 years.	0.8491116340823908
Regardless of the national origin of each Cypriot, the future of the Cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country.	0.7474575227380842
The only acceptable solution that guarantees the future, that leaves no room for foreign interventions, like those that led to all the problems of the last fifty years, is a unified and federal Cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the UN' s Security Council.	0.8962568091488963
The key to solving the Cyprus problem is in the hands of the Turkish Government, which supports and encourages the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leader Raouf Denktaº.	0.8199389051792052
For its part, the European Union, with its hypocritical professions of interest in freedom and human rights, has never been moved by the drama of the Cypriot people, by the problem of Greek and Turkish Cypriot refugees, by the enforced change of the population composition in the north of Cyprus, or by the wholesale settlement of colonists by Turkey in the occupied areas.	0.8729048934526527
Even in this Chamber, the Council' s representative referred to the north of Cyprus and not to the occupied territories.	1.0365439003577317
The recent Helsinki decision to grant Turkey accession country status, even though it has made not the slightest concession over the issue of its occupation of Cyprus, for example, by reducing its military presence there or giving back Ammokhostos, is clearly encouraging Turkey' s intransigence.	0.6632162381226178
It is not by chance that, immediately after Helsinki, the Turkish Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit, stated that the Cyprus issue had been resolved in 1974.	0.774189398437829
Encouraging Turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the UN Secretary General.	0.6748315350236472
On their course towards accession, the people of Cyprus have already lost a great deal, but stand to lose even more.	0.808010615001417
The application of the acquis communautaire has created serious problems for the Cypriot economy, especially in agriculture. It entails the liquidation of the public sector, and it dislocates and destroys the developed system of social solidarity that exists in Cyprus.	0.7864721747851868
Mr President, I beg your pardon, but the French interpreter made a small error, on the most sensitive word in the debate, during the translation of what Mr Alyssandrakis just said.	0.8851501400589257
I just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity.	0.69264994235768
Mr Alyssandrakis was translated as saying "the confederate solution would be best" .	0.48246512441493405
Obviously, he said "the federal solution would be best" .	0.73118185810586
It is a most important point and needs to be clarified, Mr President.	0.9395933385978475
Thank you very much for the clarification Mr Wurtz.	0.48972085486259564
Mr President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland Europe.	0.6983654878749502
The Maltese in particular have been very good at surviving in hostile geographical and geopolitical environments.	0.48945559856669313
Their success has relied in great part on their enterprise, their dynamism and their flexibility.	0.48789964068051084
Malta has vibrant light and heavy industry, growing financial services, good agriculture, magnificent tourism and an amazing range of employment opportunities, all of this on an island virtually barren of natural resources.	0.625353808148173
I am certain, therefore, that an island such as Malta, with its population of 340 000 cannot accommodate the rigidities of the economic and legal structures of the mainland which has a population a thousand times greater.	0.8114794725207084
Thus, when I look at this proposed instrument I do not see a measure to bring two peoples into the fold of Mother Europe.	0.7093081405310419
The situation is more akin to a black hole in space, sucking in masses so powerfully that not even light escapes.	0.476845241832723
We should not be bribing these island peoples to cooperate in their own destruction, giving them money to absorb laws which are as alien to their culture as a black hole is to Mother Earth.	0.6815884786967082
The EU should leave Cyprus and Malta alone.	0.6645364418042943
It seems to me that the only people in Malta that want this are the political class, and I shall be keeping my fingers crossed that once again the Maltese people are the winners.	0.798338066465185
Mr President, this is one of the few occasions when, from what the speakers have said in this Parliament, from all sides of the House, there is clearly the greatest convergence of views on the Cyprus issue and, of course, on the pre-accession process for Cyprus and Malta.	0.9532190960627697
This means that we are all aware of the political dimension of the Cyprus problem.	1.0930970566996812
At the same time, however, it means that both the Council and the Commission have a very strong mandate, so that the strength of opinion expressed by all the European parties, and all the peoples, can empower their political ability to address the problem.	0.9945882169197688
Helsinki was an historic event, an historic turning-point and an historic new reference point.	0.5701276654668468
If, for any reason, the balance achieved there should be considered by some to be a point of departure for new negotiations anywhere else, if some people destabilise this totality of facts and equilibrium by their attitude, they will be making a tragic mistake.	0.9535401479901258
Conditions are ripe.	0.15466677641117785
What is needed from the European Commission, the Council and everyone else, is a quiet determination, a quiet determination to continue the accession negotiations on both Cyprus and Malta without guile, granted that in the last analysis they are the most mature of all the countries seeking accession, so that this determination can act as a signal to anyone whose view may differ from the view we all agree about.	0.9568982094532478
To this end, the Brok report is a good instrument and it is really a bit distressing that, because this is a joint debate, it is politically overshadowed by the political position of the Council and the Commission and we cannot therefore say more about this good report.	1.1057749421979155
In any event, the outcome is in your hands.	0.6797543477531707
The outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions, to the extent that we are providing you with options.	0.8942210249815403
Now, as regards the Brok report, Cyprus and Malta are the last of the Mediterranean islands, and, unless I am mistaken, the last islands anywhere in Europe which have not acceded to the European Union.	0.9513587606793538
This has a certain semiological value because the Mediterranean and its islands - and I too come from an island - are the area which most of those who come from northern Europe for their summer holidays get to see, as well as the people who live there.	0.8247594896732952
From that standpoint, Aphrodite' s island, as Cyprus is known, and the pirates' island, as we islanders say of Malta with great affection, are two jewels which should be welcomed into the European Union without delay.	0.8383889503689717
They have healthy economies, high-level economic relations, and in the final analysis they constitute a testing ground for the European Union' s political will.	0.8884041694567444
In conclusion, since I do not think I need to say much, given the unanimity that exists here, I just want to make one brief remark to the President-in-Office. I think that there are some peculiarities in his position.	1.0217826988399332
I hope there has been an interpretation error, and that he will clarify the matter in his follow-up speech.	0.9089229542488305
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your comments very carefully, and in particular to the rather emotional comments about Cyprus, especially in defence of the present legal situation in Cyprus, which the European Union specifically acknowledges by recognising the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.	0.8557892839072013
Mr Wurtz, in no way can it be said that the Council is maintaining an ambiguous silence about this issue: the Council assumes total responsibility for its interpretation of the situation in Cyprus.	0.9939067232113562
Moreover, it was this situation and this interpretation which led the Council to take the decision it took in Luxembourg at the end of 1997, when it decided to take the first steps in the accession process for the Republic of Cyprus to join the European Union.	1.0587961969132567
I hope that honourable Members will realise that, regardless of the more or less emotional statements made about issues of this kind, the day-to-day reality of international negotiations normally forces governments to adopt a somewhat more flexible stance - and when I say governments I mean all governments.	0.7814949284432868
In fact we need more emotional statements to remind us that all these issues have a human side.	0.8515990915737817
But we also need to be aware that it is by virtue of rational political stances, and flexibility in negotiations, that we are able to find solutions to the major disputes which have ultimately led to many tragedies in history.	0.9018465232276193
Regardless of who is to blame - and we are not here to apportion blame, the relevant United Nations resolutions in this area are clear enough - I believe that we should take advantage of the opportunities that the new situation is opening up, in more of a rational way and less of an emotional one.	1.075723982482087
The European Council in Helsinki had the courage to take certain decisions, and I believe that various aspects of these decisions have already recognised the real value of these opportunities which, as I said at the beginning of my first speech, represent a window of opportunity.	0.8693022307264634
We will not achieve concrete results during this stage of negotiations, which is a delicate and sensitive phase, by exploiting tensions.	0.8960778237252184
No, we should continue to make progress by working discreetly to support the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with his remit.	0.8053433722799581
The European Union' s position on this is crystal clear, and I do not think it is worthwhile second-guessing particular phrases in the Council' s conclusions or in any other statement.	0.9047175862277328
We do not play at political correctness in this House: we are concerned with fairness at international level and with concrete statements on this issue consistently defined by the Council over a period of time, and which the European Commission has also followed carefully, attentively and pragmatically.	1.0377079745081197
So when we talk now about the need to involve the Northern Cyprus community in exchanges of information, particularly with a view to the eventual accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, we need to be aware that we are trying to find practical formulas that will enable us to overcome the obstacles standing in the way of a political solution.	0.8960337109139219
We are not trying to deceive anyone and we are in no way trying to use practical solutions to create a model implying political recognition.	0.8275878475228258
I believe that, over time, the Council of the European Union has clearly demonstrated that this is not how it sees this issue.	1.241229687436708
Decisions have been taken by the Council with a great sense of responsibility.	0.9381090264253649
We believe that Helsinki was very clear in this respect.	0.6396488615345436
The authorities of the Republic of Cyprus itself have clearly recognised that our relations with them regarding their accession to the European Union have been positive.	0.7591805678724534
There is no point in second-guessing or trying to second-guess our intentions.	0.5747250968732436
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all very much indeed for this debate, which all in all I have found to be encouraging and supportive, and it has also shown that there is a great deal of support in this House for the policy of the Member States and that of the Commission.	1.1042700558583771
However, I would be more than pleased to elucidate a few points as requested.	1.0511586869188967
I will turn firstly to matters pertaining to headings 4 and 7. It is quite simple: a special heading, namely, the famous heading 7, was created in Berlin, as part of the large Agenda 2000 package, for the applicant countries of Eastern and Central Europe, which are currently undergoing a process of transformation, and for these countries alone.	0.9831649166049309
Malta, Cyprus and Turkey were not provided for at this stage.	0.5475835387542484
Mrs Schroedter described this as a lack of coherence.	0.5758848875641741
She ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council, who is not exactly a stranger to you, how this presumed lack of coherence has come about.	0.699281390688722
I have had a little to do with this too.	0.9916296314075429
I do not believe this to be the case. The reason for this decision was, rather, that we wanted to have a special instrument for the Eastern and Central European States which, like Malta and Cyprus, are involved in the accession process, but under different conditions.	1.1547577457286082
Nevertheless, I have said that I understand the arguments that people have been putting forward here and the Commission will endeavour to take account of these aspirations, but since this is all about Agenda 2000 and the Financial Perspective, we will not be able to do this without amending this Financial Perspective.	1.2598093699411703
Hitherto this has been out of the question of course.	0.787564784309291
By way of clarification: if we transfer it across from heading 4 to heading 7 then this will have no effect on the overall balance of the budget.	0.7221316961559772
If we do this, then heading 7 would be increased accordingly but heading 4 would be decreased by the same amount.	0.7389475825590796
The idea that heading 7 could be added to in this way and heading 4 left alone, is not workable.	0.9177438579787779
Parliament is no more able than anyone else to spend money that it has not got, at least not until we have a printing machine installed in the basement that we can use to print euro notes!	0.9050338834898779
As for the peace process in Cyprus and how it is linked with the accession negotiations, I would reiterate that there has always been a direct connection between the two.	0.9378674534515713
The Commission and the Council have long endeavoured to encourage the two communities in Cyprus to undertake joint projects.	0.8377295046635055
So far, as you know, this has proved unsuccessful, and I have been asked if there have been any signs to the contrary.	1.0501302905362704
Mrs Rothe, I would put it this way: I am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind.	0.9258126845912625
I do not have confirmation of this at present, and nor do I expect it, since we have not yet held direct talks.	1.0229473041748116
These will take place at a later date.	0.6791099162545621
The framework conditions have changed in that the Helsinki decisions made a whole range of things possible that were not possible hitherto, and, above all, in that the political strategies employed by the parties concerned have changed beyond recognition.	0.8379164490166204
I have always believed that the old line - i.e. not to admit Cyprus under any circumstances until the political conflict has been resolved - has a weak point in that it does not provide the Turkish community on Cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves, for, with this strategy, the Turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait.	0.9024754019932981
There would then be no question of Cyprus acceding to the Union.	0.6331853776855463
As matters stand, Turkey has to take seriously the fact that there is a risk of Cyprus being integrated into the European Union, and this would provide opportunities for prosperity and security for the Greek community whilst the Turkish community, whose level of prosperity is already far lower, would fall even further behind.	0.8301410772142767
Therefore, it is my firm belief that, since Helsinki, there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict.	0.9405182370748235
Indeed that was the idea behind it.	0.597321700377146
After only a few weeks, Mrs Rothe, it is still too early to deliver a verdict on this, but in any case, I have no grounds for assuming that the new line will fail.	1.0188122372161366
As yet, we have no grounds for saying that we will actually succeed, but one thing I can say quite clearly is that the conditions that need to be in place for us to take a step forwards have improved considerably.	1.1928241633412604
Finally, of course, the Cyprus question has a role in the discussions with Turkey.	0.8330664948509228
I met the Turkish Foreign Minister in Brussels a few weeks ago and naturally I asked if Turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue.	0.643575404669342
I would just make one point: we cannot be 100% sure - I am not at any rate - that one only has to press a button in Ankara to set the wheels in motion in Cyprus.	0.9652783923396906
It is very far from being that simple, rather we are going to have to make concentrated efforts, during talks with both communities, to encourage them to reach an understanding.	0.9828995992368853
That is what we intend to do: the necessary measures and programmes are in place.	0.8931011895995048
I must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation, the one that has yet to be decided on here, before we can even get started.	1.1020922126562818
The financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus.	0.8295212861077537
I cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place, because I lack the legal basis for doing so.	0.8104336866895581
If the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point, then I am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that.	0.9025569578439981
This legal framework is fleshed out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the Commission and the Council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management.	0.8479991895230153
On the contrary, I would say that, although many areas of European policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence, in this instance I would claim, on behalf of the Commission and the Council, that we have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy.	1.0653924144634184
. (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, now that the Commissioner has explained to us, in an extremely coherent manner, that the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council and his Minister of State for Europe bore responsibility for the lack of coherence, perhaps you could help the Commissioner and ourselves, so as to enable us to take this decision.	0.8806849170853364
It would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the Financial Perspective up until 2004 and on heading B7, or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence, which is something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission.	0.8908463424701769
. (PT) Mr President, I am sure that the issue raised by my friend Elmar Brok will be considered by the Council.	0.7893635725516995
I feel that the criticism made of the previous presidency is not appropriate.	0.9293518681555207
I believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent, regardless of who was involved in that work.	0.7062563291812772
In any case, the question that this raises is an important one and the Council will not fail to support the proposals that the Commission has presented in this respect.	1.2069348681484888
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as I understood it, Mr Brok was actually referring to an earlier presidency still.	0.7387548446250255
Mr President, I asked Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument MEDA but he has not provided an answer.	0.8178708762374315
I would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us.	0.8926336361265844
Forgive me Mr Poos.	0.11739700439836728
There was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me.	0.5909971686835719
This is how matters stand with regard to MEDA: Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programmes, but not in the country-specific ones, because the incomes are too high.	0.9496257548973472
Thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen.	0.5429909925954813
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place on Thursday.	0.408151749683539
Question Time (Council)	0.24375550524597958
Question No 1 by (H-0022/00):	0.20077540987241532
Subject: Controlling access to Community waters for oil tankers In connection with the accident involving the oil tanker ERIKA off the French coast, which produced a large oil slick, what steps does the Council intend to take to control access to Community waters for tankers flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards?	0.6698941770325031
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika.	0.632059274644509
At that time, bearing in mind the strength of public feeling about the disastrous consequences of this accident, the Council made known its concerns about the safety of oil tankers and the environmental protection that should go hand in hand with it.	0.717832449963383
The Council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field.	0.9981616297509203
It emphasised the importance of the Council taking new measures within a Community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations.	0.8880356867346728
As you know, as currently framed, Community legislation requires port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign vessels, including those flying flags of convenience, and to detain them if they do not comply with international standards.	0.7782067698978976
There is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject.	0.712655507063604
With regard to the future, the Council noted that work within the Commission should shortly lead to the publication of a communication on the safety of oil tankers and of new proposals to strengthen controls, together with provisions on the qualifications of inspecting agencies.	0.8607236988592402
There are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting Community ports.	0.6445904582842585
These dossiers will be progressed by the Transport Council and I can therefore assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we will not fail to give the highest priority to the proposals, which there is every indication the Commission is due to present in this area, which we regard as being a vital part of environmental protection.	1.0612846697690517
This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure.	0.9253232639536785
I am pleased that the Council is considering this question.	1.0389634703023665
The President of the Council comes from a country, Portugal, which is directly at risk from just this type of situation.	0.8305235837223127
If we stretched our imaginations, we could envisage a situation where, between now and next summer, an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstances off the Algarve, wreck the Portuguese summer tourist industry, with a bit of luck the sea currents would carry the pollution towards the island of Madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore, wreck tourism in the Canary Islands as well.	0.7934424012198169
Does the President of the Council not think that we should stop talking and implement tough measures in this area, bearing in mind that we now have the means to control this type of oil tanker on the high seas?	0.9552108375492188
Of course, the story of the Erika seems comical.	0.7796105455307561
A French-owned ship, under a Maltese flag of convenience, an Indian crew, a sea-worthiness certificate issued by Italy, in Sicily, with the last inspection carried out in Bulgaria, I think.	0.8885060118717029
The ship was sinking and the captain realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port.	1.001923778740633
This kind of situation should not be allowed.	0.7387823990034065
The damage to your country, Mr President, and to mine, Spain, could be horrendous.	0.9834678372833511
Mr Medina Ortega, I naturally share your concerns and I can assure you that a coastal country like my own, the country currently holding the presidency, is naturally very concerned about this issue, all the more so as it does not have any oil tankers of its own.	1.0188374385578116
However, we have to work within the existing legislative framework.	1.0837928781794044
That legislative framework is the 1995 directive, which has a set of regulations with a degree of flexibility which should perhaps be implemented more rigorously.	0.7716228625619604
In this area we have to work with the world as it is, and that means reacting in accordance with the facts of the situation.	1.1325414094582027
In view of the seriousness of such situations, we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authorities have at least reacted and undertaken to examine the legislative provisions already existing in this field.	0.7856890987753132
The Commission' s intentions in this area are positive, as it intends to reinforce the application of the 1995 directive.	1.004322261425404
The Council is minded to give priority to this area, within the Transport Council, and we intend to follow this up as quickly as possible.	0.8976973705918118
We also hope that the European Parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal promptness when it comes before this House under the codecision procedure.	0.8531925654648412
Mr President, in Kotka, in Finland, there is currently a vessel carrying chemicals, which is sailing under a flag of convenience.	0.8784448018508288
The vessel is anchored outside the port, as the condition it is in is a safety hazard for the port and the surrounding areas, and because it cannot be inspected properly, as there is no one who will pay.	0.9381069180843415
Would it be possible for the EU to create a standardised inspection system that would also guarantee payment, out of Community funds, for the inspection of ships that fly a flag of convenience and cannot themselves pay the cost?	0.7184259992717308
- (PT) Mrs Korhola, as you will understand, I do not at the moment have the information I need to give you a concrete reply.	1.0451897843408624
The information that I have is to do with the 1995 directive, which does not include any provisions of that kind.	0.9158959700418033
However, the Council will certainly let you have a concrete reply on the options available for acting in the case you have mentioned.	1.0423427282016011
Question No 2 by (H-0024/00):	0.2134466106820587
Subject: High infant mortality levels in Kosovo According to the most recent UN information forwarded to the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe. About 50% of premature babies do not survive and the war has resulted in a massive increase in the number of miscarriages.	0.6520943506076257
Even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped.	0.284236724851275
In view of the humanitarian aid being given by the European Union and the efforts being made by the head of the interim administration, Mr Bernard Kouchner, what measures will the Council take to defend the rights of the women of Kosovo to motherhood and to protect the health of pregnant women, women in confinement and new-born children?	0.8466402371714281
