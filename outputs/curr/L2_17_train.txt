What is more, the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control.	0.5397388418343664
I would therefore ask the Commission to please refrain from taking this unacceptable ideological approach and making such declarations which create instability and uncertainty among the citizens.	0.5923400172853129
I referred to the case of Italy, not only because the President is very familiar with it, but because Community statistics (Eurostat) themselves reveal that not only has Italy' s welfare expenditure - currently 25.9% - been below the Community average (28.2%) since 1990, but that it has also been well below that of countries considered to be doing well, such as Germany (29.9%) and France (30.8%).	0.8254879553721296
Europe' s role: we first need to emphasise that Europe rejects war as an instrument for resolving international conflict: only then can we talk of the 'military' role of the Union.	0.768538469327504
Agriculture and health: we see the issue differently from the Commission: in our view there are no consumers: there are only citizens who want to eat healthy food - products which are not designed for competitiveness but health, quality and respect for the environment.	0.9514011154525724

(FR) The proposed action and programme presented by Mr Prodi are vague in the extreme and the social question is missing yet again.	0.7114079626873443
In fact, the word seems to have been banished from the Commission' s vocabulary, whereas liberal and American references abound.	0.7732533390583914
Mr Prodi reverts to the contested concept of 'governance' ; contested because it favours state intervention over a proper working democracy and refers to the notion as defined by the IMF, whose ideological agenda is predicated solely on liberalism and monetarism.	0.5161298445466079
The shift in meaning is not just semantic... The only logical thing to do on reading this document is to pursue the mass market and generalised deregulation and forget about the realignment of European policy which our citizens hoped for.	0.7168959841395062
Mr Prodi talks solely of 'mechanisms' and 'structures' and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people.	0.5372915512071956
Enlargement appears to be an end in itself, but unless decisions are made on a social policy, a common value and an institution to strengthen the cohesion and democratisation of the Union, the Europe bequeathed to us at the end of Mr Prodi' s presidency may well be a simple common market area within the context of generalised globalisation, rather than the community of destiny which we hope for.	0.8901922487612691
Finally, Mr Prodi' s complacency towards the Austrian Government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol (which in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence.	0.7695362337927588

The nature of the EU has not changed.	0.967375930586472
Since the beginning it has served the interests of a few dozen large financial and industrial groups and their pressure groups.	0.6689843629882704
But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the EU so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United States, which it also sees as its future competitor and rival.	0.7067775346951186
This new imperial policy advocates reorganising European and national institutions, strengthening the power of the state, increasing competition, establishing a European army and redistributing financial resources.	0.6719220747625076
Even daring to refer to the defence of a 'European social model' is a shamefaced lie because the more the EU combats the United States, the more it becomes its clone.	0.7694032835411818
We shall vote against these objectives, because we are fighting against this policy both in Parliament and on the streets.	0.8953242582549189
A European charter of fundamental rights would be the only ray of light in this policy but, yet again, there is no provision for the people of Europe themselves to be able to address and decide on this democratically.	0.8235759027762583
We abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution for the following reasons.	0.6254699782358597
Firstly, the motion does not condemn clearly enough the vagueness of the priorities and commitments indicated in the Commission' s programme.	0.7346197357351926
Secondly, in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years, we consider that the main question to be considered by the Commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the EU which neither the programme nor the motion mention.	0.9826367311900563
In our opinion, the Commission' s role in the near future will be dependent on some of the European political initiative being returned by the governments of the Member States following the Santer Commission scandal.	0.814336380262399
This is very positive as this is how the national parliaments, on which the governments depend, will continue to show that their democratic mandate is indispensable to European construction.	0.9858219098413005
The truth is that the European Parliament is still failing to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which is determined not to think about Europe, as demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections.	0.8752606675704977
The mechanisms used in the cooperation between the governments of the Member States must therefore be reinforced and made more coherent, more transparent and more democratic.	0.8236049050116372
We welcome the efforts of Mr Prodi to improve the public image of the Commission and the need for the latter to agree with this House and the Council.	1.2760137464239307
However, the priority should be to reform the governmental cooperation mechanisms, particularly by creating a Council of Ministers for Europe which, by itself and in coordination with the other European institutions, can assume the responsibility for transforming the political decisions of the European Councils into specific actions.	0.990614996402369
Corrie report (A5-0032/2000)	0.19141435572177015
Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly was coloured in 1999 by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation models derived from the Lomé Conventions.	0.6136262051073942
Back in 1994, the Joint Assembly passed an initial resolution, in which our fellow Member Dominique Souchet was closely involved, expressing its alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which contradicted the very principle of Community preference which was fundamental to this cooperation.	0.721411709538761
These fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them.	0.5730887455782998

Although Mr Corrie' s report roundly condemns this situation and reaffirms the Joint Assembly' s attachment to the Lomé model, he fails to highlight properly a second problem which, to tell the truth, is also the result of the free-trade error, namely the incoherence of the regional trade agreements signed by the European Union.	0.8762988502073097
The cooperation agreement with South Africa is a prime example.	0.5775984448260422

(FR) The Commission' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the Community would appear to respond to a primary concern: a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south-east Europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the Second World War.	0.6564596357454991

And yet, under these difficult conditions, especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO, some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community.	0.8384940663396566
In this sense, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case.	0.6069328474587338
Exemplary because it proves that the Balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the European Union in stability and association agreements.	0.7832732963738921
Symbolic because it reflects well on the Fifteen' s project to see the birth of a policy which is common to the five countries in the region (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM and Albania) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement.	0.7916046449311569
The UEN Group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states. A satisfactory solution cannot be found in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion.	0.7162954383029336

In all matters, we attach importance to the fact that there should be the greatest possible transparency in connection with the decision-making procedures involved in EU cooperation, for example with a view to guaranteeing the necessary democratic control.	0.8931859345824396

. Mr President, industrial change, which can be gradual or sudden, is driven by new technologies, worldwide competition or consumer preferences.	0.7677108216468288
It has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion, but it also provides major new opportunities when anticipated, prepared for and managed.	0.7617678581658645
The acceleration of technological progress and the increasing competitive pressure of globalising markets are pushing companies to rapidly adapt their production and company structures.	0.3891129377004552
Companies must be able to anticipate and identify at an early stage what they need to do to ensure the continuity of their activities.	0.7165598461401987

The Commission is acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult times of change.	0.8897418088185284
We are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis.	0.5751765054742362
We have had in the recent past different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large-scale operations of corporate restructuring, often affecting the lives of large numbers of European people.	0.6615768457213682

Firstly, decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management.	0.6385069593091199
This means that, when contemplating actions likely to lead to serious social consequences, job losses for example, companies should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution.	0.6277469668518721
Secondly, when dismissals prove to be inevitable, the utmost must be done to reinforce the employability of those concerned.	0.8528785269012603
This requires anticipation, timely preparation and careful management of these processes.	0.47219835159415335
Thirdly, nothing can justify the absence of timely, effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers' and employees' representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced.	0.6671048491265918
Worker involvement is always, and particularly in the event of corporate restructuring, not only a basic right but a necessary precondition for the social acceptance of such operations.	0.8479501393157118
In the end it is also a decisive factor of their success, as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust, dialogue, partnership and solidarity between its different components.	0.7850009746142406
These basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in Europe.	0.48796145235859906
This is what intelligent restructuring is about.	0.6002927113595016
It is more and more rare to see companies embark on damaging restructuring operations ignoring these fundamental concerns, as unfortunately was sometimes the case in the past.	0.6245273384517908
We have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the European Union.	0.6407615217670934
We have set minimum requirements at European level, which all Member States and all companies must observe when contemplating job losses, especially when they are massive, or preparing other decisions likely to affect workers.	0.8768199925129808
The collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings directive and the European works council directive constitute our legal framework, protecting the workers' rights and ensuring fair standards in the field of information and consultation at national and transnational level respectively.	0.725117718924812
As regards the national and/or local level of employee involvement, the Commission wishes to underline again the need for proper information and consultation of employees' representatives before any redundancies are decided or implemented, as provided for in the collective redundancies directive and in other national provisions.	0.7884674988440615
I wish to recall that it is, in principle, up to national courts to deal with possible violations of these rules, if and when they are brought before them by national representatives.	0.8112692938600424
However, even when existing rules or arrangements are formally respected this does not mean that management' s attitude is socially irreprehensible.	0.6759296622137796
In fact, the Commission has argued for some time now that the rules we have established are not sufficient to deal with the challenges of today.	1.0197450331942772
In a world characterised by permanent change and in the context of high levels of unemployment, the rules in force seem to us to be outdated as they do not allow or promote the key ideas behind our employment strategy and our approach to change, anticipation, risk prevention and employability.	0.7026939292850783
That is why in November 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support.	0.791965675454921
We thank you for that.	0.6072412886331641
Unfortunately, the other branch of the legislative power, the Council, has not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begun working on it.	1.1165366020535674
I hope that this debate contributes to reminding Member States of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative.	0.9834791284439053
We have recently heard from the Portuguese Presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched.	0.8523841995136531
The forthcoming French Presidency also seems willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserves.	0.4829815679880772
The Commission sincerely hopes that Parliament and the Council quickly finalise this important dossier which constitutes, in our view, the most effective answer to the concerns raised by cases such as the ones which brought us here today.	0.8670909934386148
As for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their European workforce.	0.6554010769542555
They may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force.	0.5324489534009365
The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this.	0.8340294658224083
In any case, I wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them, notably through relevant national jurisdictional instances.	0.7834463669189264
The Commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the European Works Council Directive.	0.7835095930488569
As recognised in the report, which we will adopt in the forthcoming weeks, we accept that the directive contains some loopholes.	1.1521009331507748
Nevertheless, as my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions, when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately, different considerations must be taken into account.	0.9083426865371429
First, any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies.	0.7596700975744977
Secondly, an immediate revision would make things much more complicated as regards progress in respect of the other pending dossiers in this field like European company statutes and the national information and consultation proposal.	0.7136294898675559
The successful outcome of these other dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the EWC Directive and even provide some degree of a solution to the problems identified above.	0.5518502117189118
That is why we tend to consider that it might be more appropriate in this context to proceed with the revision of the European Works Council Directive only after the conclusion of those two dossiers and following a more complete evaluation of the application of the directive.	0.8783997912618727
Action is not limited to legislation.	0.4373811856568124
To encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the Commission is also developing the recommendations of the Lillehammer Report by preparing the setting up of a European observatory on industrial change.	0.7170542855737073
We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group, the Managing Change Report.	0.68814212386315
Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House.	0.8361383511503876
As for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy, let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers' representatives to be heard by the Commission in the framework of the relevant procedure.	0.8216904827168336
Generally speaking, we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations, including their effects in terms of employment.	0.827564354928488
As an example of this I mention that public authorities, notably the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment.	0.7396268625431025
To this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years.	0.6337225194349154
The same provision was included in the Structural Funds Regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds.	0.6877885795259712
Social cohesion and the interplay of policies at EU-level is the focus of the forthcoming Lisbon Summit.	0.687147053970906
I know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe.	0.7808104534294592
Thank you very much Commissioner.	0.5440952003269491
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I understand you have a point of order.	0.8957266228969605
If it is a personal statement, would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate, at which stage I would be happy to call you?	1.0314735049375046
Mr President, the problem is one of public honour in this Parliament, it is not a personal statement.	1.1186560316964165
This morning, the President of Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order.	0.8774198997136682
Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Madam President has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me.	0.8350588449279355
In doing so, Madam President has breached Rule 142 that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak.	0.5122954523990916
She has also breached Rule 122 that gives the right to all the Members of this House to make observations, observations which in this case refute the remarks made by another deputy, Mr Vidal-Quadras.	0.8244609365135963
This partisan behaviour of our President should be criticised most firmly.	0.311413112044532
I will willingly accept Madam President' s apologies any time.	0.3279050005628525
Thank you for your statement.	0.5074835714908583
We will certainly make sure that the President is informed of your statement.	0.7961527988504574
I can assure you that as far as I am aware the President never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote.	0.8384712456646797
Therefore the House was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage.	0.49277722223760284
But thank you for your remarks.	0.5317549374928715
Mr President, I welcome Commissioner Liikanen' s words, and I am contributing to the debate - we are all contributing to the debate - because, although the subject is broad in scope, it also concerns a specific fact.	1.1533382301975377
The subject in question is of great political and social importance.	0.9072385257011523
Free enterprise, free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the European Union.	0.8637430379557337
Company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments, and must therefore be defended.	0.8655620448136696
However, all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles.	0.8095471510664377
Today, we are witnessing one of these cases, which, on the surface, may seem to be of minor importance and affect only the specific industry, but which, if it is allowed to pass without an authoritative intervention by the European Union, will become an unwritten rule which will cause problems for many of the Member States and the Union as a whole.	0.9985710190905132
An American company - Goodyear - with production sites in Italy, Germany and England, is reviewing its production and relocation, justifiably, in its own view.	0.8147367861306192
However, it seems to be doing it without observing the relevant Community legislation, for it is certainly not giving reasonable notice to employees or heeding the obligation to render an account of their use of Italian and European public finances.	0.8165253020730079
In Italy, Commissioner Liikanen, Goodyear is not carrying out restructuring but closing a plant whose production covers 14% of the market and which Goodyear itself defined as, 'having the most highly-skilled workforce of all its plants' , a plant which was opened with a total of EUR 85 million of European capital.	0.7003967016338921
No notice was given of the closure, and no intention was shown of discussing the fate of the plant or its workers, despite the fact that the public funds invested in that plant make it much more public than private.	0.7357636866911589
It would be a serious matter if every non-European company were to learn to use Europe as a bus where you do not have to pay for the ticket, you do not have to pay for cooperation, you benefit from using the facility and you leave without being accountable to anyone.	0.8717661740382007
Europe has to guarantee every sort of freedom, including freedom to use one' s own money for the purposes of one' s own freedom and not to let others use it at will, others who make demands and then, when the break is made, refuse even to discuss the terms of the break, despite the fact that this is a break which has been declared unilaterally.	0.7877488110223754
Just now, Commissioner Liikanen was talking of restructuring which must not be uninformed.	0.8119866163807267
Sadly, in this case, he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring.	0.9908489741433388
I would also like to point out to Commissioner Liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court.	0.9001668412118984
Of course, it is always possible, but when jobs have been lost and factories closed down, the idea of going to Court when proceedings are as lengthy as they are in Italy is not very reassuring.	0.8731417570519997
Commissioner Liikanen, we expect an authoritative intervention.	0.6885611116322707
As Parliament, we are, of course, expecting to be able to contribute to the resolution you mentioned - we are ready and waiting - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this, which can on no account be allowed to reach its conclusion and be forgotten, as has almost happened already.	0.9248848128272316
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the second time within the space of four months, we find ourselves debating the restructuring of companies in Europe.	0.7702759603988216
This is - as it was the first time round - sparked off by the reorganisation of large companies, which is linked to a drop in employment.	1.0320773895187485
I would like to make it quite clear that the Liberal Group is against any political interference in companies, in terms of both finance and management.	0.8196364722975794
Our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed.	0.6720499951052382
It appears that Goodyear in Italy received Italian and European subsidies to the tune of approximately EUR 40 million.	0.5159657007771068
The company went under despite this.	0.21424991222961207
This goes to show that jobs cannot be bought.	0.5166710368352436
The market is a law unto itself.	0.525114502557463
As such, state aid costs the government twice: first in subsidies and then in unemployment benefit.	0.539171949526054
Surely this cannot be the role of your, my and the citizens' tax money?	0.9184952458258131
All this, of course, does not mean that our Group does not share the concern of the Italian Members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned.	0.7157105941736671
My Group is also opposed in principle to the naming of specific companies in this resolution, for two reasons: firstly because this creates selective responsibility.	0.7926366941032167
A company is pilloried one day and not the next.	0.5913036489712516
Why should this be the case?	0.7175801291445929
Michelin caused a great stir.	0.2419949935503627
But I did not hear a squeak when Nissan and IBM were discussed, where, similarly, a great number of European employees were involved.	0.6994772991430885
Secondly, this is not fair towards employees of other companies where reorganisations also take place and where it hurts too.	0.7383185616733045
My Group has signed a joint resolution with EPP and UEN, in which, however, we made it clear right from the outset that we are against the naming of company names.	0.9187315575446509
This is why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9.	0.7797987716884874
If these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted, my Group will abstain from the final vote.	0.6534656581601285
I do hope that this will not be necessary.	0.8983737275687431
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 both talk of full employment for which two essential conditions are required.	0.7287358275231168
The first is to create new jobs for young people entering the labour market and the second is not to lose jobs.	1.1385376945199568
Yet the current situation in Europe provides us with clear examples of how jobs are being destroyed, particularly, and most seriously, by companies which are making huge profits.	0.9180454566561539
In the past, workers were asked to show their solidarity with companies in order to ensure their survival. Now the companies are making huge profits but are also making workers redundant.	0.6601266570263259
Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy.	0.5334578838232927
There is also another hidden way of making workers redundant, as practised for example in Spain by the Ericsson company under the term 'externalising' . Note that sensitive words like 'redundancy' are not used.	0.6920488212342117
Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights.	0.33858870067555297
This is just an underhand way of making workers redundant.	0.3985937952108292
Commissioner, if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment, they must take clear steps to secure this.	1.0575222614771036
They must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations. They must revise the directive on collective redundancies, reduce the working day, link European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union.	0.7756570599671477
Mr President, sadly, once again, Parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in Europe.	0.773597505469808
Yet again, workers are likely to lose their jobs.	0.5297718181062315
This time, I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina.	0.7626187548117743
As has already been pointed out, in one month' s time, 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income.	0.6925978812998965
Despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe - these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle, while Goodyear, after years of benefiting from state and European subsidies, is totally free to walk out.	0.8642109278212402
I do not think this is at all fair, either to the workers at the Cisterna plant or to all those Italian and European citizens whose taxes have, albeit indirectly, enabled Goodyear to benefit from the state aids I have just mentioned.	0.832107758699938
The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs.	0.9888180188429893
Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant.	0.9196315208631937
Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to remind the House that there is very little time available, and therefore that any measure - including those already cited by the Commission in its introductory report - which we adopt must have an immediate, timely effect.	1.019513129831778
Mr President, Commissioner, as far as restructuring goes, there is no doubt that European companies must adapt so that they are better placed to face new challenges or go under.	0.7579556753307072
We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management.	0.6739451649004097
Although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares, this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of financiers, often shareholders, with the sole unavowed aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company.	0.7736833557120101
The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers, be they by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this respect.	0.6951574473537974
Rationalised management and improved profits should, in my view, serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost, and any financial benefits should follow.	0.6144892066520715
However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit.	0.8169010905940028
There is a very real risk of seeing a two-headed monster emerge on this planet, with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital.	0.7217972896952186
Surely Europe should act as a safeguard, maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare?	0.5224403808714515
We must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results.	0.6842031391289711
Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for 'difference' .	0.679454000938997
Europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs. Without doubt, the voice of difference in this monotonous flood of restructuring.	0.652916658597545
Mr President, last month in the UK, in a region that neighbours mine, the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres.	0.7965447409670943
I, like all Members present, am saddened by this loss of jobs.	0.6782308449834332
Equally, I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution.	0.6336769291069341
But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company' s decision.	0.7193645269320375
This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes, in this institution, forget that Europe cannot survive alone.	0.8619899087245989
We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent.	0.34736775182250684
In my few months here, I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU, nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave.	0.7419603713098005
In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted.	0.7529828467125241
Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant.	0.7123340650781793
In a world where surely less regulation is the key, we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union, untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens.	0.8861951098637605
We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them.	0.5423024852042978
Take a large successful business, add European regulations, and within months you have created a small one.	0.6473289211063123
Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here.	0.6663506135827736
Mr President, I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today.	0.8599708124713242
In this respect, I share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s view that we cannot talk about these in detail.	0.8425751845215951
But maybe next time, we ought to discuss CORUS, the merger which has now taken place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel.	0.7493643517683453
I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the European Union and policy in other fields.	0.6815864506842371
In this light, I am pleased that Mr Liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion, where the interests of employees are concerned, with Mrs Diamantopoulou but we can involve the Commissioners who are active in other fields.	0.9099031543785985
I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission' s policy from these different vantage points, unlike my predecessor, who holds the belief that there is no need for rules.	0.7397805456848675
We need to gain an insight into what companies are like now.	0.46966288829528546
At present, we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition.	0.5887332174675074
What remains of the concept of what a company should be like now is naturally very relevant: whether it is merely the property and toy of shareholders, or whether it is a more broadly based stakeholder society, which is meant to guarantee continuity for staff, consumers, suppliers and the local population and has, in addition, a social function.	0.8457068052317278
As such, I would like to ask these various Commission directorates and these various Commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments.	0.6665708726932288
I think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in Europe, as company policy forms part of this.	0.9092959169931826
The government is talking to trade union and Goodyear delegates in Italy as well, in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopted by the North American multinational in Cisterna di Latina, an area of Central Italy which has already been affected by other restructuring operations.	0.8092709763051752
The closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty.	0.46885644935591286
The Goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight, in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the Goodyear workers in the different European countries as well, and there are many of them: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia.	0.8485246514734767
Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits.	0.8233767187461293
The European Union, in all of its aspects, must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes.	1.099582377335922
Mr President, earlier this week President Prodi announced that one of the Commission' s strategic objectives for the next five years would be to aim for full employment.	0.6823535500086455
He acknowledged that 15 million Europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion.	0.6002911925951822
What is more, the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority.	0.5477304854772753
Yet, all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies.	0.6233138431793371
The Commission' s decision to allow the ABB-Alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point.	0.6954999063653153
The new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings.	0.5091661268374325
This global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs.	0.49388256744506304
In my region of the UK in particular the employment consequences of this merger have been severe as a result of ABB-Alsthom having announced that it was cutting 270 jobs in Britain with 95 jobs being lost in Stafford and 112 in Rugby.	0.6095831346661668
The company' s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying.	0.5981795187123253
It is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee.	0.6467104881196476
Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation, adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States.	0.6596403019582405
I do not think it is simply a matter of a Community charter.	1.0208281124662746
EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer.	0.7589904201082442
The Commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences.	0.7409440353954206
We need more joined-up policy making on these issues.	0.524651614876986
What we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation.	0.5821492095593391
This is the only way of respecting Article 127 of the Treaty.	0.8251681147101407
I welcome the statement made by Commissioner Liikanen, but I also look for the support of this Parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have passed on workers' rights is implemented rigorously and to ensure that impact assessments on the workforce for proposed mergers are undertaken as a matter of course.	0.9232542180901
I have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	0.572614147117513
That concludes the debate.	0.1437775861795048
The vote will be taken later this evening.	0.8704782053793461
The sitting was suspended at 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.05 p.m.	0.4273884883832792
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	0.1455766746044931
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	0.3717355587323584
Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain)	0.20714144954813454
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	0.48215283139804194
B5-0149/2000 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on outbreaks of racism and xenophobia in the El Ejido area in Spain;	0.5893221274347628
B5-0159/2000 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Sánchez García, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain);	0.5035618614053514
B5-0162/2000 by Mrs Díez González and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the outbursts of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	0.5383739013838251
B5-0169/2000 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on outbursts of xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	0.5264967900508041
B5-0175/2000 by Mr Bautista Ojeda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on xenophobia-related incidents in El Ejido (Spain).	0.46651005724029604
Mr President, I am reassured by the fact that the first three speakers in this debate are intimate with this situation given our African origin.	0.836364922105366
I must firstly congratulate the groups in this House on the high degree of consensus achieved in the motion for a resolution. I am aware of the efforts made by Members to avoid using an issue such as this for electoral purposes.	0.8957468790719048
Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone.	0.8024189987464485
We should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner.	0.7318073560328034
These events, which are unfortunately overshadowing the political decisions in this area, confirm without doubt that the development of the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the EC Treaty must be an urgent priority.	0.8177527779153182
Today' s problems cannot be solved in five years.	0.5106716642452356
They will take a long time, as we are finding out.	1.021607235948067
The legislation of the Member States must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in Tampere, as paragraph 7 of the motion states.	0.9173864434158342
Legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays.	0.33523848615439245
Furthermore, the labour market must be organised realistically so that jobs held by third country nationals are subject to labour legislation on wages, social security and social protection in terms of equality. This will eradicate the labour exploitation and markets in marginalised people, which are resulting in the events condemned by the motion, and which are the real basis of the current social problem.	0.9560273680033003
Solidarity, dialogue and agreements between local, regional, national and European institutions and employers, unions and the immigrant communities themselves, whose countries of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility, are essential.	0.8047685815066351
Collaboration with the countries of origin on this issue is vital. In this respect, the action plans approved by the High Level Group and the Tampere European Council must be allocated a budget.	1.0105340701688081
Specifically, I must stress in this debate the plan for Morocco. This is a country with which the European Union has an effective relationship and common interests and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration.	1.0244303667038381
Finally, this House must tackle the phenomenon of immigration with sufficient calm to avoid increasing tension in a debate which must go much further than the appropriate words and condemnations prompted by such behaviour.	0.6968869453195368
This is a very important social debate in the creation of a European area in which the right to freedom, security and justice will be recognised in the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	0.9675050356694537
Mr President, Commissioner, whenever a serious social problem occurs, it always has a political basis. This is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in El Ejido.	0.7714067487554361
The proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this House have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions.	0.7293660207467683
We all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers.	0.4879093780594686
We all, I believe, agree in our condemnation of the xenophobia and racism which was apparent in certain actions.	0.677468116797585
These events certainly have their origin in, among other factors, the absence of a clear immigration policy allowing the affected communities to live together respectfully and peacefully.	0.6584645331027054
We hope that the events in El Ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated.	0.7205697543111222
Yet it is not enough to regret the situation.	0.819031057180706
We do not want Africa to become our cross, in fact quite the contrary.	0.9940889298348327
We must therefore act.	0.7049896899334256
I should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another European region affected by immigration - the Canary Islands.	0.743366779644601
Firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors.	0.38072694247426214
Secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration.	0.5541108471870125
Thirdly we are carrying out education programmes on tolerance and respect.	0.34318454107441837
Finally we are producing a census of immigrants.	0.2743708085836337
I hope that these measures will help towards ensuring compliance with the Tampere Agreements on immigration and the new Spanish Act on aliens. In particular they must ensure that people arriving in Europe do not lose their dignity.	0.8261898768884229
Mr President, last week, in the Andalusian town of El Ejido, we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the European Union in the year 2000.	0.8784068280912227
This was acknowledged by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, on 9 February when he confirmed that what had occurred in El Ejido went against the very principles of the European Union.	0.7626397238920782
These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism, xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated.	0.4598860374398346
It is incomprehensible that ways of coexisting and ensuring mutual respect cannot be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial.	0.5007647494171942
The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities.	0.9475766028201429
We are all immigrants.	0.8493866800551431
For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated.	0.44056559414900914
Geographical mobility is not an invention of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work-related causes.	0.56018222490608
We are all immigrants, if not ourselves personally, then through one of our relations or ancestors.	1.1188825181010156
However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment.	0.6942921892151701
What happened in El Ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the European Union.	0.6656423270530967
We must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area. A whole community should not have been held responsible, criminalised and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident.	0.7412286831479213
Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately. Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism.	0.8821650953308027
In particular, local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia, especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property.	0.7296225019366349
These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these, as has happened with the mayor in question.	0.8337951551403855
Thirdly, the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials. They must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union.	0.8164372641584167
Finally, the European Union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles.	1.0206186979844407
It must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstrations in its territory and support and collaborate with national, regional and local authorities and non-governmental organisations and associations in the application of these principles. This must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrants resident in the EU.	0.7873175021961588
Mr President, initially our Group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon.	0.7790996876190287
However, the incidents in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout Europe and which deserves our full attention.	0.6872063785514104
We thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in Europe. Yet, over the years, social disintegration in Europe has been combining with an increase in migration from surrounding countries and increased awareness of human rights to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance.	0.70942457527331
This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider' s.	0.7242393369313802
This House therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures encompassing all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately. We must ensure respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues.	0.7324674392131207
In this respect we must not forget that the original victim' s attacker was suffering from a mental illness for which he had been inadequately treated.	0.6552109081571686
The current difficulties must also be taken into account so that this town can adopt the necessary measures, as indicated previously.	0.9024746957413708
Finally, as our Nobel Prize Winner, José Saramago, has said, we are all in each other and as Jesus Christ said, although Saramago disagreed with this, we should not just love one another, more importantly, we should respect one another.	1.0244236903773676
Mr President, Commissioner, Andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the European Union.	0.6448677516835353
Since time immemorial it has welcomed all those who have decided to move there and regarded them as Andalusians from day one, whether or not they were born in our region. Therefore, as an MEP, but primarily as an Andalusian, I can feel only sadness, repugnance and condemnation for the xenophobic and racist events which have occurred and which are foreign to this tolerant community.	0.7483535813404039
Yet a worrying situation is apparent.	0.2861958563711398
All decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the Community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like Andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents. I am referring, for example, to the lack of agreement with Morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry, part of whose fleet is moored in Almería.	0.7603200917114137
I am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and vegetables by the EU which is dominating relations between Almería and Morocco. I am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions, Member States and European Union which, due to actions or omissions, is leading to a few territories like Almería having to support this migratory pressure from north-west Africa on their own.	0.8122917776238913
All these factors have unfortunately been accumulating over time and are now allowing those who are cruel, intolerant, racist and destructive, of which all our countries have some examples, but thankfully a minority, to light the fuse of xenophobia.	0.7316488950936259
Anyone, whether European or not, who lives and works in Andalusia, is an Andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect. The EU can and must speak out.	1.000899751218543
For you, the south is Andalusia but for us Andalusians it is Africa.	0.62638405643925
We must therefore ensure that the EU provides every possible resource so that the economy of the south can prosper and enable a society to develop with more tolerance and respect for one another. This has not been achieved with the solutions proposed to date which have quite simply been based on looking the other way.	0.8473739133824703
Mr President, Commissioner, I speak from experience acquired during many visits to El Ejido over the years. I was therefore aware how the situation was developing.	0.8543783847905404
Here in the European Parliament, as in many other institutions, we have watched this situation with concern and were beside ourselves when we heard what had happened. This is because we felt the problem to be ours, as it was.	1.0354914260924173
In El Ejido there is a serious social problem, problems of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which acted as the detonator.	0.7904694276446613
These events have also acted as a wake-up call to our consciences.	0.47914823069591533
Here in this House, in Spain and in many other countries, we have all fixed on El Ejido. Yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening, not only in El Ejido, but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment.	0.8942110177231049
We all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward. We will not find the guilty parties in this House or in many other places.	1.0673976578973265
Those responsible for what happened in El Ejido are a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrants. We must bear in mind that vengeance is not a solution.	0.7354398884302924
These problems can only be solved by close cooperation between all the authorities in order to achieve social integration and respect for all working there. This therefore requires a determined fight against illegal immigration and profound respect for the rights of immigrant workers who are legally working in El Ejido and throughout Europe.	0.7568863569811578
Mr President, this resolution expresses solidarity with the democratic forces in Spain fighting for human rights.	0.7487957705578794
All the Spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support.	0.6483262809127072
It was not only immigrants who were the victims of atrocities; the democratic system in Spain has been held up to ridicule, despite having demonstrated its tremendous capacity to evolve over the last 20 years.	0.7064022112932044
Employers would be lost without immigrants.	0.3508165690809789
Working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no Spaniard will accept them.	0.42166861686040064
Low wages, the lack of housing - some are living in cardboard huts - the lack of access to social services and the de facto system of apartheid are abominable and unacceptable and are not worthy of the respect which every human being deserves.	0.7218477967595316
What happened at El Ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in Europe today.	0.5879584680156488
For four days, the immigrants were collectively hounded.	0.5638431886091911
Women and children were beaten.	0.44417482716795
Fleeing from all quarters, hundreds of immigrants took refuge on a hill on the outskirts of the town.	0.3706809891129912
We are right to blacklist Haider' s Austria; but we cannot allow little local Haiders to practice policies of racial exclusion and merciless economic domination.	0.6085015576394001
What happened in Spain could happen in any country in the Union if we are not careful.	0.9768405076721776
We all have a duty to put our own house in order.	0.5139719513405672
I support this proposal for a resolution, especially the points which refer to the application of Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, and point 11 of this resolution establishing a link between the Structural Funds allocated and the fight against exclusion.	0.8459000136809347
It would be to our credit were the European Parliament to roundly condemn these events and support all proposals tabled in order to ensure that the rights of immigrants in Spain and throughout the Union are respected.	0.884466006130325
Mr President, acts of racist and xenophobic violence are taking hold at the heart of Europe.	0.5228536283171745
Everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements.	0.32187434021885036
We must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature.	0.5723069383417353
No European society can truly flourish when it harbours the risk of seeing one section of its population fall prey to the hatred of the other.	0.5679378433778846
Having received a delegation from the Austrian human rights association here yesterday and having seen what has happened in the province of Almería, it is easy to understand that we could easily have prevented this resurgence of racist hatred.	0.6652248711720138
These violent scenes at El Ejido are so similar to archive pictures of Alabama in the 1950s, when the KKK terrified the black population, that it is hard to tell them apart. They also put us in mind of Germany in the 1930s, when the Nazis were persecuting the Jews.	0.6814546711933047
Without wishing to lump everything together hysterically, because each period is different, we have failed to learn the lessons of history.	0.7296108829359731
That is my conclusion today.	0.6189986206587222
Because this witch hunt which broke out in the province of Almería should have been foreseen.	0.5391836841144793
It is the result, first and foremost, of the ghettoisation and exploitation of immigrant labour.	0.8290552110373879
Three annual crops of Moroccan and African workers support 100 000 people and manage to bring in an annual turnover of nearly EUR 2 million; and yet 60% of them have no running water in a region where, as we know, the temperature may reach 40 degrees in summer.	0.7426598678356331
We also know that many of them only earn EUR 30 a month, while their fellow European citizens can earn three times that.	0.6282298933332858
This precarious wage-earning position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable.	0.400649177548803
The irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion.	0.5684885549005553
We should counter such acts of terror, Mr President, by setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in preventing other conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere. My fellow Member, Mrs Roure, was right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order.	0.8320299519021195
Finally, and I think this is important: why not have the honesty today to relay what was disclosed in a recent UN study explaining that, if Spain wishes to preserve its work, retirement and pension potential, it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year 2050?	0.8031817029471089
We must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember, to recall the dates in history when our countries teetered on the brink of horror.	0.6532058447755518
We need to educate our children on these matters and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepared to accept many more immigrants in years to come.	0.7378991517257034
It just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday.	0.5030521801779116
We must take to the streets of Europe to protest against these alliances with extremists which are a disgrace to Europe and which lead our youth astray.	0.7170724530850257
Mr President, since the signature of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has had responsibility for combating racism and xenophobia.	0.940892591232492
Two types of measure are required for this purpose. The first should seek the integration of people of non-European origin and the other should aim to organise immigration.	0.8271934257793482
With regard to the first, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and an action plan, which aim to apply the following decision taken by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere. This states that 'The European Union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its Member States.	0.8991077991626882
A more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens' . This is totally contrary to what we have seen and found recently in El Ejido where there are irregularities, labour exploitation and indecent living conditions, which have been condemned in the past.	0.8772276323771955
I hope for prompt implementation of the measures to achieve integration. I also hope that the governments which produced such wonderful words in Tampere, including Spain, will work diligently to apply these.	0.8907763645566572
I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement made by the Council on immigration.	0.948964130625395
The only proposal which has been made is for the directive on family reunification. This is a key issue, as we have seen recently in the media that there are many men on their own in El Ejido.	1.1253675376367773
Yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments. Outside the Community arena, some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies.	0.8646634075056581
This is occurring in my country, despite the government, the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens.	0.8676978778644866
The objective of combating racism and xenophobia, explained in the Treaties, should be the objective of all European institutions and politicians.	0.9330118430961944
On 28 February 1998 the European political parties, including the Spanish Popular Party, signed the Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society.	0.7582655137665265
This requires coherent behaviour, yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out.	0.5146860055758256
The party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belongs should, according to the commitments signed in this Charter, act forcefully.	0.5877709615501749
It is only, as stated by Mr Hernández Mollar, through unity, responsibility and firmness that El Ejido, Spain and Europe will be able to overcome these events of which we are deeply ashamed.	0.8063043922946308
Mr President, one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of lynching, no less, of Moroccan day labourers which took place in El Ejido.	0.7225983866711424
We do not the extent to which far-right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame.	0.5434182364705737
We wish to assure these Moroccan workers that they have our full support - as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough, they have to suffer this type of aggression.	0.8264886593012901
And if the aggressors include working-class people, all we can say to them is that, in acting in this way, they are digging their own graves.	0.7926085392765905
In waging war against people who are as poor as they are, they are only doing their own exploiters a favour and preparing a future of oppression for themselves.	0.5924869688883626
But there are some who bear even more responsibility than the thugs who wielded the iron bars and knives: those who spread racist and xenophobic slander, those who indulge in anti-immigration demagoguery in Spain, Austria, France or elsewhere, sometimes even here in this House, are no better than those who take this stupid, reactionary demagoguery at face value.	0.6456870571787489
The lynch mob and their extreme right-wing mentors are the mortal enemies not only of the workers, but of society as a whole.	0.6932803911289109
. I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Member on the way in which he introduced this extremely important debate.	0.7816750963100997
I want to make it clear at the outset that the Commission unreservedly condemns the dreadful acts of violence at El Ejido against the immigrant workers of the region.	0.843852889483952
We express our support for the families and friends of the victims.	0.7038370602386733
President Prodi and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements.	0.5081991923216802
Naturally I completely endorse what they have said.	0.4175278838712558
It was especially moving to hear the remarks from Members of Parliament who come from the region about what has happened, uncharacteristically, in a part of Spain that I know reasonably well.	0.8588188275318174
Racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our Community, wherever they take place.	0.4903659298087709
They fly in the face of the very principles on which - as Mr Havel said yesterday - the European Union was founded: principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights.	0.8748022982929207
Of course progress has been made in recent years but we still have to work together towards a climate of tolerance in which racism and xenophobia are regarded as completely beyond the pale, completely unacceptable, while at the same time we deal very robustly with incidents such as the ones we are discussing this afternoon.	0.8217917370983553
We need, in our judgement, to focus on a package of measures including: first, the introduction of effective, anti-discrimination legislation at Union level; second, implementation of a common immigration policy with regard to the nationals of non-Member States to promote, in practical terms, the integration of the immigrant population in Member States' societies; third, the introduction of measures to combat social exclusion.	0.8905473732605836
The European Union has already laid the basis for Community legislation on combating discrimination on the grounds of race.	0.8793405463742443
The insertion of Article 13, which was referred to during the debate, dealing with non-discrimination in the Treaty establishing the European Community, is one of the most significant changes of the last revision of the Treaties.	0.9271138832907482
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force the Commission has presented a package of proposals for the implementation of Article 13 including, in particular, a proposal for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment regardless of race or ethnic origin.	0.9164175184601474
This proposal is under examination by the Council and the European Parliament.	0.9743261095381729
The Commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete.	0.4699316536837832
The conclusions of the Tampere special European Council, as Mr Hernandez Mollar said, clearly illustrated the will of the Heads of State and Government as regards the introduction of a common policy on immigration and the principles on which it should be based, with particular emphasis on the Union' s policy on the respect and promotion of the rights of migrants.	0.930751281536944
At Tampere the Heads of State and Government also emphasised the importance of approximating national legislation on conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals based on a shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments in the Member States as well as the situation in the countries of origin.	0.7709336323058362
The European Council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration.	0.6899098763807058
Its objective here is to secure the rights of victims of criminal networks organising illegal immigration, with particular reference to the rights of women and children.	0.8042977891183206
Those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour.	0.3618761971299126
The word that is used about them in Chinese society is 'snake-heads' . It seems to me a fitting description of them.	0.71463533983782
Let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a European Union charter on fundamental rights, which has now reached the drafting stage.	1.0061966289170408
Those rights are, by definition, universal.	0.7257242321058034
The charter will extend to third country nationals in Member States even though certain rights will be reserved to nationals of Member States of the Union.	0.5924086859183038
The El Ejido incidents were shocking, as several Members have said in their speeches.	0.7256065106097892
But trying to take something positive from them, I hope they will spur us on to translate our aspirations about tolerance, fairness and freedom into real and effective policies that will help to transform the lives of all those families and individuals in the European Union who cry out for our understanding and our help and who deserve it, not at some indefinite moment in the future, but here today.	0.7229125789114703
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6002529528362665
The joint debate is closed.	0.35336613335004935
The vote will take place at 6 p.m.	0.4737869736389093
Human rights	-0.0
Mr President, before we start the debate on Kosovo or Mitrovica, I must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me.	0.8450800735931165
Indeed, it is not the first time that we will be debating Kosovo here.	1.148241595764441
We have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot, as nothing is actually done with them.	0.7637592552450827
I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attends.	0.8364779982595372
I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten is present, given his powers.	0.8019896241161201
But I - and many Members with me - also have to note that the Council is consistently absent from this debate.	1.0136436193351843
We need to cooperate with the Council too.	0.9759860324267089
I see that a diplomat from the Council is present who is diligently taking notes and who will then report to the Council but, for the rest, nothing will get done.	0.9125035809224435
I would insist on changing our procedures and on the fact that the Council should be present during the topical debate, so that we can enter into direct consultation with the Council.	0.7907333279029266
I think we should give this some thought.	0.7188440980223921
I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament.	0.5233507647241021
Mr President, Commissioner, we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons.	0.9177488641890476
First, because Mr Sakellariou, who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote, vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender.	0.722225306634209
I have no doubt, and I am sure that you have no doubt, that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance.	1.0952555667066912
The other reason is that this text does not, unfortunately, go very far.	0.6617647988530371
I think that it manages, through a series of clever devices, to carefully avoid addressing the central issue, i.e. the final status of Kosovo.	0.847326240087173
I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia.	0.5790963223650252
I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of Kosovo.	0.5939617491000918
I also doubt that any of you think that, as things stand, it is not in Milosevic' s interest to pull out all the stops and destabilise Kosovo, as he is doing and as we have seen.	1.015203935359097
Finally, I do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to Kosovo.	0.8101164055307871
I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution, which you no doubt overlooked.	0.8255953459091465
You condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troops.	0.37831433054511676
I would not want you to be birds of ill omen, but I fear that, by failing to confront the real issue, you will end up being just that and I shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen.	0.9654968057347085
On the contrary, I think it is our duty to call on the Commission and the Council, which unfortunately is not present, to insist that the United Nations consider the question of the final status of Kosovo, of the multiplicity of micro-states in the region, of what happens post-Dayton and, finally, the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be built up in these countries and give the European Union a policy in this region.	1.0236839864711067
Finally, I would stress that we have been asking the Council and the Commission since July to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 Kosovar prisoners and Mrs Brovina, Mr Jurti and Mr Hoti.	0.9092226426921752
I note that the Union is preparing to lift certain sanctions and that we have not seen even one of these prisoners released in exchange.	1.057823016618721
Why not?	-0.0
Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible.	0.8242602489751097
Violence begets violence, and revenge begets revenge.	0.6028719040992205
The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on.	0.7614265759910099
The Chief Commissioner of Police, Svend Frederiksen, has expressed his desperation at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed.	0.5873481506018801
He has fewer than 2 000 officers, and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000.	0.8487380413360186
The police force should be large enough for it to be a visible presence, so that people can believe that it is in a position to stop atrocities. It should also be large enough to be able to clear up crimes and punish those who are guilty of them.	0.8894076561909716
Otherwise, there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands. It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained, and the idea was, in fact, that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained.	0.8868764589665298
However, there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime. A year ago, we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up.	0.9042159501573088
I was in Kosovo on 27 October 1998 when the Serbs withdrew.	0.5640642229225398
The agreement was that 1 800 OSCE observers should arrive to guarantee the peace.	0.5108662720014846
After a month, however, there was still only a handful of observers.	0.7389115632304029
By Christmas, there were perhaps 100 and, by the spring, still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was, in fact, in place.	0.9420564079592123
Atrocities were not even being recorded.	0.35591209148654684
Then the war came, and the observers were withdrawn.	0.7189862441563163
I would therefore ask the Commissioner: can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in Europe?	0.8454644935478425
Can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers, who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad?	0.5980948290563975
I might also ask: when do you anticipate that they will be in place?	0.7943952803365063
And when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities?	0.5201406077286463
I mention this last issue because it is the solution we should be embracing as quickly as possible if peace is to have any chance at all.	0.7437727843580599
All who are in contact with real life in Kosovo share the same opinion: it is a tragic, desperate situation where there is a democratic void and no possibility of the different ethnic groups living peacefully side by side. Mitrovica is a tragic example of this.	0.7606275432471555
Before military intervention by NATO, Milosevic' s policy for Kosovo was certainly to be condemned, and the demands of the non-violent forces of the Rugovo era for the Kosovar regions to be autonomous were justified.	0.6942079092246518
But NATO' s decision for military intervention and the KLA' s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced Kosovo to a colony, as well as destroying civil infrastructures in Serbia.	0.615240332729168
Today, Kosovo has no adequate strategy for protecting minority groups, and these include not only Serbs and Roma, but also moderate Albanians who still believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and are persecuted by the extremists in power.	0.74756589831811
It is useless to talk of the Roma houses which have been burnt down and the thousands upon thousands of new refugees and the refugees from Krajina, who are now living, barricaded in, in Kosovo, abandoned by the UNHCR, which itself has been abandoned by the donors, while the emergency is still of dramatic proportions.	0.7502060299571488
In the joint resolution, we ask the Council and the Member States to double their efforts to ensure respect for minority groups and to work towards the creation of democratic structures, giving a voice to all those forces which still believe in peaceful coexistence.	0.9348262629296021
In this sense, I am in agreement with Mr Sakellariou' s proposals.	0.9412253951227424
Another subject being discussed is the release of the Albanians held in prisons, particularly Flora Brovina, a woman of extraordinary humanity whom I met, together with the Women in Black of Belgrade, during joint attempts to build bridges between women from different ethnic groups.	0.66983404271564
Flora defended herself, and asked Serbs and Albanians to shake hands.	0.6033495208528777
Flora Brovina' s husband is the guest of Serbian women in Belgrade.	0.3016853217093504
This is a sign of hope, the hope that it possible to act differently even in Serbia.	0.8333564201226208
It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned.	0.7782964140126988
She might well have been abandoned by the large institutions, but we, who worked in Kosovo and Serbia for many years, are doing our utmost to campaign for her release.	0.923120079780187
I believe that the European Union must do likewise.	1.0651332264958304
The embargo on Serbia must be lifted and Serbia must, in turn, release its political prisoners.	0.6197749702676487
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fully endorse Mrs Pack' s very emotionally-charged contribution.	0.5211963961285926
What she has said here is completely justified.	0.3826834733894283
There is not one truth in Kosovo, there are several.	0.8834953461084287
I refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that is bending the truth.	0.9078472787802808
I completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us.	0.5020679262601299
We condemn all violence over there and that is what we need to do, but we cannot talk about genocide in reverse.	0.9829045869708268
Needless to say, the situation in Mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why.	0.8983011832964585
There are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the Trepca mines also plays its part.	0.5845936843485355
We have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners.	0.8703786596998492
There is a great deal of pain, a lot of suffering in Kosovo.	0.7810838216098528
The people are holding demonstrations, they are sending us e-mails.	0.6394945962267816
They ask us where their children are, their sons.	0.5784412943103125
We need to be able to go back with a proper answer.	0.7011969949688093
The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many.	0.6971934930812217
We are right to include this in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds, even thousands of Flora Brovinas out there.	0.9198167827369386
I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners.	0.8645298425815303
The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo.	0.6119896322167856
Mr President, in the present joint draft resolution, paragraph 10 urges the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the UN police units.	0.9435453617710235
This request is fully in line with the vision held by the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo, Mr Bernard Kouchner.	0.7048854657771444
In order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo, he needs, by his own reckoning, at least 6 000 foreign police officers.	0.7410229444075048
The UN, however, have pledged to dispatch a police force of 4 800.	0.5375863927631712
To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal.	0.579829985697689
Moreover, half of this group is from the United States and Germany.	0.8734436133303031
It is logical that the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation, especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region.	0.7521886866201056
What is disconcerting, however, is Mr Kouchner' s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days.	0.5882764254877592
Paris is leaving its fellow-countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen, not more than 37, in the crisis region.	0.6709913684318662
For this hardly honourable position, Mr Kouchner blames none other than the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Chevènement.	0.8334201224842503
According to Mr Kouchner, the Minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the French police officials on ideological grounds.	0.799398077444764
I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome.	1.0657586791970293
Press freedom in Angola	0.13688126335251963
Mr President, I do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity.	0.6061373957697167
On the question of Angola, I think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last.	0.9754482773911097
It would be the first in a long time.	0.9888301517154231
So I welcome it as such.	0.3581525534543778
I think that the European Union and the western world in general has had Mr Savimbi in their crossfire for some time now, with no discrimination whatsoever, but corruption is now so rife in Mr Dos Santos' s regime that even his long-standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything.	0.729093418275287
So I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter, especially the worrying things which we are discussing, particularly logistics support for the information services by the United States and Great Britain, generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely 'spicy' matters which we need to go into.	0.9203358277626632
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the European Union.	0.8862595662064648
Clearly, governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial, geostrategic or economic interests.	0.49562247274808213
We have established requirements for the countries which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support, because we believe in democracy and its values.	1.0545337664302086
A free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy.	0.44516429651720096
There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion.	0.5809337914441403
Yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted, detained, threatened or put under pressure.	0.368195691052101
We rightfully condemned the behaviour of UNITA which threatened the peace process in Angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace. Rightfully and with the full weight of our authority, we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the Government of Angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society.	0.7459357072086119
Mr President, how much longer can we continue our cooperation with Angola?	0.7602693746042113
Human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time, not only by UNITA, but also by the government itself.	1.009291664301824
The legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle.	0.42705588019671176
The Angolan Government must immediately authorise a substantial UN presence which can mediate and can report on human rights.	0.4284506989954563
Additionally, European observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists.	0.675088792367966
Europe, as a major donor, has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola.	0.8635742754359313
If the Angolan Government continues to refuse to cooperate, measures will need to be taken.	0.7644249002539053
Without national reconciliation, reconciliation with Europe is not possible.	0.7004835810649978
This being the case, Angola will unfortunately remain a very rough diamond.	0.3931464013501614
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this House. The repression of both Angolan and foreign journalists in Angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment.	0.7875428421723333
However, this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that Angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them.	0.7492151121861205
Yet this is not the situation.	0.835362472607702
Angola does not enjoy rule of law. It is a repressive dictatorship.	0.8396835350638692
It is at war, and a bloody war at that, which is dragging on and on.	0.9562536467200908
The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept.	0.6879332360369215
The repeated appeals made by the Angolan church and, for example, by Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki, for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this House.	0.8298897160912734
As another Member said, we must have a general debate on Angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country.	0.9074233941071616
For example, I have today received information directly from Rafael Marques, whose situation we are discussing, according to which two correspondents from Portuguese television have been imprisoned in Angola.	0.6875273557412914
These cases keep occurring.	0.17433934183102912
Yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in Angola.	0.899612380538679
The silence of the major powers and our own silence are questionable and are benefiting a regime of corruption, violence and war.	0.5404510453776019
I must draw attention to the fact that the war in Angola is spreading to other parts of Africa.	0.6665375336389999
It is impacting on the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the situations in Namibia and Zambia. It is now also affecting the situation in Zimbabwe where Robert Mugabe has just lost the referendum precisely because he has sent troops to the Congo to prop up Laurent Kabila who is beyond salvation.	0.6167881580284407
There are two sides in Angola or rather two armed groups.	0.5265629684960459
The first is the MPLA, which controls the oil profits. The second is the armed band of Mr Savimbi, which controls the diamond profits.	0.8525534842609829
It is oil and diamonds which are financing the continuation of the war which, as has been said, is terrible. It has displaced millions of people and caused them to go hungry.	0.9235294315337682
It has led to a critical and tragic situation in Angola.	0.4484685412682066
This war must be stopped.	0.40604481631388367
The authority of this House could play an important part if we were to have a major debate on the Angolan situation and also on the whole of southern Africa.	1.1118802732777302
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom. It is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes.	0.8706451557804835
The problem considered by the motion is a major one but, as has already been touched upon, could be regarded as minor in light of the even greater problem of the general situation in Angola which is experiencing a terrible humanitarian disaster.	0.8228055693468781
This situation, as in neighbouring former Zaire, is like a festering wound in which it is not clear who is infecting whom. As Mr Soares just said, a truly terrible situation is developing in Angola and in other countries in the region.	1.019073789153963
This was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the First World War of Africa, given the involvement of certain countries in others.	0.6585352192497442
This is a major issue because the Angolan State and authorities must assume their responsibilities. The international community and the European Union must spell this out very clearly.	1.0137210855637044
These journalists are professionals who are trying to inform the public in their country and denounce the corruption existing in this regime, for which they are being persecuted.	0.8611426474843874
It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola.	0.6892377997012801
We have experienced this in our own national and European history. People can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant.	0.7695939746219669
The cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace, although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible.	0.8290923361480442
Like a previous speaker, I also fully support the appeals which have been made.	1.0017547083557312
We must, some time soon, find the courage to tackle the whole Angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously.	0.6473393274814667
In recent years, the behaviour of UNITA has merited our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the Angolan State for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people.	0.5640992937375254
We must establish dialogue with other forces in Angola, be attentive to the appeals of the Angolan church and encourage the emergence of other national institutions, national reconciliation and new cultural and political forces not engaged in war. These can then eventually free this country and this people from the armed fate which they have been experiencing for decades.	0.6691652429164644
The people of Angola deserve better.	0.5822657810887143
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems as if the world is turned upside down.	0.7081697227653002
Journalists are sent to prison for simply speaking the truth, whilst soldiers who are supposedly fighting each other exchange smuggled goods in the bar in the evening.	0.5033613251337967
This is Angola' s reality.	0.2535238888585139
We are now expressing our horror concerning this war.	0.5391135319646576
Three million victims, two million driven from their homes within the country' s borders, hundreds of thousands driven away across its borders, including women and children.	0.6441531696035674
This is a war which transcends its borders. It is not just UNITA which is to blame.	1.0875565571774102
The government too is responsible for this continuing violence. This is why we insist that the journalists - more than 20 were imprisoned last year - keep speaking their minds.	0.7924598778276747
We would, at the same time, like to insist on other things.	0.7230798129418612
We want the UN embargo, which is supposed to prevent a large proportion of arms and ammunition from being flown across to UNITA airports, to stop.	0.7746191351637822
But what do these sanctions mean?	0.33644687312639826
It is the western world itself which is partly to blame.	0.716664284163622
It is we, our own people, who keep the war going over there.	0.8798630363019871
The so-called civilised world should hang its head in shame.	0.3224701909511577
This is also the case for the so-called statutory government which is just as guilty, because if this journalist has accused the President himself of deriving benefit from this civil war, then all he is doing is voicing what the entire world knows already and which is being passed on to every tribal district across Africa.	0.7880759020956078
Mr President, we are partly to blame for this war.	0.8236004046736235
We should stop financing this regime and we should certainly stop supplying arms for the war.	0.6074161679619677
Mr President, the facts are well-known.	0.9476150927666641
On 24 December, the Angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the Portuguese paper, Expresso, to a year' s imprisonment and a fine of USD 20 000.	0.720606900516301
The journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the President' s cabinet.	0.37091841803997716
The trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness.	0.37691067299872993
Another journalist was threatened with his life during a parliamentary debate last month by a member of parliament of the MPLA government party.	0.6271874883088415
These are only two examples of a trend in Angola to silence any government critics.	0.4374846472123277
Over the past year, more than twenty journalists have been arrested for alleged slander or criminal offences against state security.	0.6593057781353978
Their only crime was to criticise what human rights organisations have been denouncing all along, namely the large-scale corruption and disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars, paid by the oil companies to the Angolan Government.	0.6030467879244626
Even the British Minister, Peter Hain, conceded this recently. We should ensure that the oil revenue is not used merely to finance the war or to line the pockets of prominent members of government, he told President Dos Santos last month.	0.6672683802671253
But, at the same time, we note that Great Britain and also Portugal are continuing to channel military aid to the government.	0.7098512550072793
There is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding Angola.	0.5382486343195734
On the basis of a report, the human rights organisation Global Witness concluded that the western world is turning a blind eye to the activities of Dos Santos because it is fishing for lucrative oil contracts.	0.6618251345786051
I would like to challenge Portugal to deliver proof to the contrary, by making commercial interests subservient to human rights, to which so much lip service is being paid.	0.7652597988983392
In my opinion, Angola is a test case.	0.46586915875090146
We should, at any rate, judge the Portuguese Presidency on its actions and not on its words.	0.7086732475586629
Native Americans in the US - Dineh	0.5283632651491929
Mr President, the American leaders do not seem to have learnt a great deal from the criticism of how they treated the Indians and other indigenous peoples.	0.6513742664649981
We have to admit that our European sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect.	0.8870029929062282
Once again, an indigenous people' s right of existence is being threatened.	0.6318773783210837
Once again, the individuality, dignity and health of a people are being sacrificed to the higher economic interest.	0.6325459128684947
Once again, we are losing a piece of our planet' s cultural and ecological heritage, despite the many treaties and resolutions on human rights, on the protection of minorities, rights of indigenous peoples, etc., which have already been ratified.	0.8581859581834271
If tradition and culture have to make way for economic imperatives at all, we should at least give sufficient attention to the reception and reintegration of the peoples concerned.	0.7482315311080002
But if we are to believe the environmental movements, even this is vain hope.	0.8372077006113052
There are hardly any reintegration programmes for people who have been relocated to the so-called New Lands.	0.5427586708662234
It very much remains to be seen whether these New Lands will be safe in terms of public health.	0.6016054750480719
It is of key importance that the American authorities provide greater clarity regarding the way in which they are trying to offer these families a dignified alternative in keeping with a traditional way of life.	0.6467112956731882
It is also important that a debate is held where the long-term effects of mining in this region are discussed and weighed up in economic, ecological and social terms.	0.7490439284091448
The credibility of the industrialised north is at stake.	0.44691765357277324
Indeed, what right do we have to demand of developing countries that they give their minorities a voice, that they protect their valuable natural areas and that they respect human rights, if it transpires that we are unable to meet these demands in our own countries?	0.9733246510349491
Mr President, as Mr Van Hecke rightly pointed out, this is about human rights and about the rights of indigenous peoples, and Parliament must speak up, especially vis-à-vis good friends, and the United States is a good friend.	1.1091131087188821
This is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time.	0.7127523437779264
It is up to the European Parliament to protect vulnerable people.	0.9607766360519863
So we need to do this.	0.9011185748432035
This is also about respecting a culture, a language, a way of life and a people' s religion, a vulnerable culture which has nearly disappeared.	0.9708554073610443
It is important to point this out.	0.7074299884137462
This is why it is necessary - and Mr Van Hecke has already mentioned this, and this is also what we clearly ask for in our resolution - that the role of mining in this vulnerable desert area is reassessed.	0.9676965032644329
We have just approved the water directive here in Parliament.	0.7444282087191152
The water which these people need to exist is under threat because the groundwater strata there are being drilled by a mining company, and this is why the traditional way of life of the people who live there is being threatened.	0.8020389189395793
The forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally.	0.4104988683035573
People should no longer be forced to move.	0.5925546301231269
Over the past 25 years, no less than 25 000 people have been forced to move and this must stop.	0.8954344176878678
If people need to move at all, they need to be given a viable alternative.	0.846848615566693
This is not the case here.	1.0041645463915212
The area where the people in question are now being taken - and this is also the reason for this resolution - is a polluted area which is economically not suitable.	1.1151509221860696
This is why I think that we as European Parliament need to ask the American authorities in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and, if necessary, abandon the scheme altogether.	0.848080636031715
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my maiden speech and I am delivering it with a great deal of pleasure and conviction as the topic is human rights.	0.706586286946796
In terms of human rights, Europe has a very eventful past and this is why we have become to some extent the cradle of these human rights.	0.8678716110925538
We need to continue to stand up for these rights, especially in our own Member States and societies, but also elsewhere.	1.0985583129901018
As Mr Sterckx said, we certainly need to do this vis-à-vis the United States which, after all, is close to us in terms of democratic values.	0.8997741302513854
The treatment of the Native Americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights.	0.6967352471435552
The account of the Dineh Indians is telling.	0.466139242243796
With the discovery and, certainly, the exploitation of black gold - and, later on, uranium and oil - all possible means were used to remove these people from their land and to send them to regions with few prospects other than poverty, hardship and contamination.	0.7216046158680097
The area in Arizona which is to be the New Land for the Dineh Indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in US history.	0.6760973032299142
It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land.	0.6858421238211999
The fight of these Indians is being backed by more than 250 NGOs and, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian 'Mother Earth' organisation, we are being kept informed of this situation.	0.7392644581425405
This too is characteristic of American society, which hears little about it.	0.6129090845056668
They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents, but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country.	0.6008275147289251
Today, the Dineh Indians are facing their final fight for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, for their right to their way of life.	0.7798861852117902
There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful, economic adversary.	0.6969704689222764
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers, but I would like to emphasise a few things.	0.9900125485136844
The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians.	0.616605637372066
They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years.	0.422014378585625
They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years.	0.5107149257631461
The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries.	0.6939606958519905
The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples.	0.7082817781478496
This relocation is, of course, unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic, social and cultural terms.	0.6308157804884731
The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and, in that way, lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their forefathers - but also any prospect of work and sources of income.	0.8229136280806459
The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry.	0.40095708249296974
Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives.	0.8089323636962877
The population was not allowed any input.	0.31017157749943614
This resembles a kind of trade in human beings.	0.4893505280875294
The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium.	0.5015000951817341
After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world' s most contaminated areas.	0.6300712510604689
The United States administration, the coal industry and all of us need to acquit ourselves of our responsibility and provide a sound alternative: either the soil is cleaned or the Dineh Indians are allocated a proper place where provision is made for all kinds of support, be it in the psychological, social, cultural or budgetary field.	0.7221375607663706
It is high time we respected the rights of the Indians.	0.5385724577729475
This is why we ask you to vote for this resolution: we in Europe should not be intimidated by American interests which are being pushed by financial, religious and industrial groups.	0.8753356963316871
So let us contact the United States now!	0.5259903752229248
Madam President, despite the protests by the international press, we still do not know the fate of Mr Andrey Babitsky, the courageous Russian journalist who has worked intensively to ensure free and independent information on the ordeal of the civilian population of Chechnya and the destruction of the city of Grozny.	0.7453501470132032
Among the contradictions in the accounts that have been given, there has also been an attempt to reassure international public opinion over Mr Babitsky' s fate, by confirming the theory that there was an exchange of prisoners with Chechen fighters which, inter alia, if this did actually take place, would constitute a breach of international law, which certainly does not provide for the involvement of civilians in such circumstances.	0.8471641377081907
Nevertheless, we now have more precise information: we know that the acting Russian President himself, Mr Vladimir Putin, asked Russian special services to safeguard Andrey Babitsky' s life and freedom.	0.7732690513414294
This is an admission that confirms all our concerns and makes Parliament' s position on the case all the more appropriate, as it calls for a concurrent explanation of other cases of journalists who have disappeared in the Chechen region during the conflict and the safeguarding of media coverage of a conflict that has reached unacceptable levels of violence.	0.6983921766148984
Moreover, we are asking the Russian authorities to provide immediate clarification of conditions in the so-called detention centres, and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention, maltreatment or killing of civilians are laying themselves open to accusations of crimes against humanity.	0.6339030530729091
We would ask the Council and the Commission for clear and prompt action and a political initiative which does not overlook the issue of human rights.	0.8332948669598911
Mr President, in terms of human rights, there is of course a great deal amiss in Chechnya.	0.8980713913367849
We have received reports from human rights organisations saying that Russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - I am talking about old men and women - in Grozny.	0.727071087529892
Citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air-raid shelters.	0.5342975912870394
We insist that these violations of human rights are investigated.	0.58333502402174
Despite the pledges made, violations in, for example, Alfanyurt have still not been investigated.	0.5491927922804811
International government organisations and non-governmental organisations must be allowed access, and the Union' s general Council decided on 6 December 1999 to send representatives from the Member States to Ingushetia to study the humanitarian situation there. I am, to say the least, curious to know how they are getting on.	0.8629140612061243
The fate of Andrey Babitsky, the correspondent in Grozny of Radio Liberty, who was arrested by Russian troops, is a dramatic example of Russian policy.	0.7523291305819751
It contravenes Article 3 of the Geneva Convention of 1949 and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press.	0.7218228378421939
We want information from the Russian authorities as to Mr Babitsky' s whereabouts and his state of health.	0.4533463500074049
Mr President, a journalist is on a fact-finding mission and this calls for freedom.	0.6234802589980338
Yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war.	0.38744564616159755
The war in Chechnya, like any war, is a trail of horrors.	0.9252955151469109
The filtration camps are camps in which torture, rape and violations are perpetrated: we know that now.	0.4760624569909595
And just what is Mr CFSP doing?	0.3954157097081478
Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a full member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, it has been invited to G7 and is a client of the IMF and the World Bank.	0.9602432726363622
What are we doing about it?	0.5294617974727295
I do not understand why the power centres of Europe are keeping quiet, letting things pass and, by working with the Russians as if nothing were amiss, giving its support to the government which is waging this war.	0.7867508515333266
I beg you to intervene.	0.24034966075609152
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic case of the courageous Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky illustrates once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which Russia has sunk.	0.552600501137377
The entire Federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda.	0.7112230372692063
A warlord has become President and he has even been described as a reformer in some western quarters.	0.44789287283424456
Journalists, on the other hand, who are simply going about their work in Russia, i.e. endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible, are being treated like criminals.	0.7730029333647397
The Russian Government appears to have lost its fundamental understanding of what democracy is about and truth appears to have become a threat in its eyes.	0.5589064651439526
I can only reiterate my appeal to the Council and the Commission to stick to the rules.	0.9934431429407771
It is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the EU if it does not recognise democratic principles.	0.7363849566340123
Mr President, what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as 'terrorists' and 'bandits' ?	0.7064523492000149
Without any hesitation, the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs, Vladimir Rushailo, earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question.	0.5902581636871332
The victim of this exchange is said to be the 35-year-old war correspondent of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Andrey Babitsky.	0.5313803465233236
I am using the phrase 'is said to be' on purpose, because official Chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged Mr Babitsky for a number of Russian prisoners of war.	0.5874786240337129
In the meantime, the highest Russian authorities are casting a veil of secrecy over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist.	0.5078448170817862
For example, Acting President Vladimir Putin gave an assurance last Monday that he had ordered the country' s security services to bring the missing reporter back to Moscow safely.	0.5034188746690009
Russia' s new strong man, however, added a rather puzzling comment to this welcome declaration: 'As far as I am aware, Mr Babitsky already feels free.'	0.669045474955171
This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising.	0.5562146528818764
The facts are clear.	0.39700207030597934
Andrey Babitsky was an unwanted busybody in Mr Putin' s 'anti-terrorist' operation in Chechnya.	0.36920796902161246
Hence his disappearance of over one month.	0.24946659132371968
In any case, the Babitsky affair warrants one conclusion: the leaders in Moscow cannot possibly maintain that hostage-taking and trading in defenceless citizens is a specifically Chechen crime.	0.5071552982913794
This resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the Chechen tragedy.	0.5580051014990599
Nor is it a mere luxury.	0.44199987880660085
Indeed, it is in line with some thirty Russian media bodies which yesterday distributed a special issue on Andrey Babitsky free of charge.	0.5943057454775313
Cambodia	-0.0
Mr President, Commissioner, it is because of my experience in the Balkans, when I was there on duty, that I call on you today to support the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to bring those responsible for the genocide in Cambodia to trial before an independent court under the aegis of the United Nations.	0.8194832762772117
I do not think that reconciliation is possible after such murderous tragedies, unless those responsible for starting them are brought to trial and sentenced.	0.635572055699945
Nor do I think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial.	0.8542311007719023
I became convinced of this in Sarajevo when I had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement, none of which unfortunately lasted, between the parties to the conflict.	0.5765634856196753
Every time, just as the exchange was about to take place, we found men missing from the meticulously drawn up lists.	0.7482215252314438
Every time, when we asked why, the reply was the same, 'We cannot release him: he is a war criminal' .	0.9172263413003748
In the emotion, pain and fury of the agreements, it was impossible to break the vicious circle of blood and vengeance.	0.595596555156174
If we want to help the Cambodians with the task of reconciliation on which they have embarked, we need to try and sentence those responsible at the highest level and thus exonerate the simple underlings and all those who were willingly or forcibly dragged along behind them.	0.7506903951412208
I expect Ta Mok and his main lieutenants to be tried and sentenced by the establishment of a tribunal whose impartiality is guaranteed by the United Nations.	0.5255828758110158
This will be the only way for the Cambodians to pardon those who simply followed them and to achieve lasting peace.	0.8966456891560597
Mr President, it became known this week that two prominent Cambodian opposition papers have been threatened with closure because they are reported to have insulted the king and prime minister.	0.5903755643288605
These papers actively support the opposition politician, Mr Sam Rengie.	0.5827509872315011
Legal proceedings have been initiated against Sam Rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason.	0.5685770536392993
In his millennium speech, he dared to raise the fact that it should become clear what the procedure would be for appointing the successor to King Sihanouk in the event of his death.	0.7564310221039
In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal.	0.7720008019572309
In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister.	0.8079408896551998
This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm.	0.3974170288235985
In October, a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid.	0.6734806992975289
The pattern of intimidation is clear.	0.19695946082681276
There is more going on in Cambodia: prisoners are being tortured, the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children, and people are held on remand to an excessive degree.	0.7632617959112952
All this is happening on a daily basis.	0.6523524772737825
Even more serious is the government' s refusal to bring the leaders of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal.	0.5410982729749421
It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased.	0.6260724302577231
The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union' s relations with Cambodia.	0.7840335785078754
Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected.	0.8081603044493684
Living examples of this have been the Pinochet-Ugarten case, Kosovo and, in milder form in our own Union, the debate surrounding the government decision in Austria.	0.8739352294529827
This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice.	0.7291474101645012
At the same time, the struggle against impunity is under threat.	0.5713040625900992
The situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow.	0.7331922198796174
. Mr President, we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday.	0.8872029753014778
I am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge.	0.9965107506343388
First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails.	0.8863487663500466
Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation.	0.7884148362022099
In particular we support the development of a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society.	0.8787975711625715
Our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and, in particular, to try to build confidence between the various communities.	0.917583751579909
We have always condemned ethnic violence, no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim.	0.6709177103202468
We consider it is unacceptable against Serb and Roma minorities as it was against the Kosovar Albanians in the past.	0.6779869205431053
We support the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR and the OSCE to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order.	0.7248847663873909
In this regard we strongly support the High Representative' s recent appeal to Member States to provide more police officers for the UN civil police mission in Kosovo.	0.7014324539830606
It was a point raised by several speakers in the debate.	0.8705206723582856
I hope it will underline the importance, when we address the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy, of looking at the non-military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects.	0.8865267758889778
It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity.	0.6776164125821414
We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons.	0.7358422679833425
I totally agree with the points put so passionately by the Mrs Pack, either before trial or following judgement.	0.5139281732109644
The plight of Kosovar Albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing.	0.7120833862238622
We call on everyone, within and outside Kosovo, to support these common aims, to support UNMIK and KFOR in their efforts to achieve them.	0.9708935616524683
Turning briefly to Angola, we had again a number of knowledgeable speeches, especially from Mr Soares, with his unrivalled knowledge of the subject.	0.8805856683484445
The Commission believes strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in Angola.	0.5648570882962209
It is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society.	0.6791828890980186
An area of special concern is the harassment of journalists, including temporary detention of members of the so-called independent press.	0.6578479934305538
The European Union made a specific démarche on press freedom to the Angolan Ministry of Justice in November last year.	0.6325116776951399
We fully support the work of the UN through UNUA, given its specific responsibility to monitor the human rights situation in Angola.	0.8071180525589908
We are also committed to the Security Council' s sanctions against UNITA, including arms controls.	0.8528804134695555
While maintaining emphasis on humanitarian needs, the Commission is preparing for a post-conflict phase in our financial support for Angola.	0.7602812186941154
An essential element will be support for democracy and human rights, including specific initiatives to strengthen democratic institutions and civil society.	0.6872624137251947
The European Union has condemned the use of anti-personnel landmines and we are supporting de-mining operations through an international NGO.	0.7483593788520736
The resolution I would love to have a debate on in Parliament one day is on demining, and particularly the importance of destroying the stocks of existing mines: stocks in the Ukraine, stocks in Moldova and stocks elsewhere.	0.6881056307327842
This is a subject which is not given sufficient attention.	1.0454657588452436
On the question of the indigenous peoples in the US, I am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the US authorities will have been noted by them.	0.8623964641249217
Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America.	0.8851742781950751
The Commission shares the growing concern about the missing Russian journalist, Mr Babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in Chechnya more generally.	0.7386519022626561
This issue comes on top of our deep worries about the plight of the civilian population in Chechnya, and I have heard Mr Posselt on this subject before.	0.8203231856844253
There are alarming reports of human rights violations.	0.45631781239997043
Of course, there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict.	0.774510307992251
The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a European Union Troika démarche on the eleventh of this month.	0.5480123533696472
We underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the Russians to clarify the circumstances of Mr Babitsky' s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights.	0.638737282158329
We await a proper response from the Russians.	0.3291797153462041
In the meantime, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council earlier this week have confirmed the message which I have given today.	0.7972429628720719
And we are ready to return to the issue at the EU-Russia Ministerial Troika in Lisbon on 2 March, if we need to do so.	1.0245166422608754
Finally, on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge: we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes.	0.7058533128568529
I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon.	0.6618131901796629
We vigorously supported the Troika démarche to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong on 4 February this year.	0.2819696862160232
The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders.	0.854546001134017
At the same time, we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties.	0.8102944343633535
I am encouraged by the optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal.	0.6527650996602602
The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year.	0.6269237578446013
It has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days.	0.5702775510432697
I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead.	0.9118861699115589
Thank you very much Commissioner Patten.	0.5429909925954813
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m.	0.40471383201013267
Danube environmental disaster	-0.0
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	0.48215283139804194
B5-0164/2000 by Mr Leinen on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists,	0.46907009273529904
B5-0167/2000 by Mr Maaten and Mrs Thors on behalf of the Group of the European Democrat and Reform Party,	0.5595134154451724
B5-0168/2000 by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Grossetête on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats,	0.5997115219173956
B5-0173/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sjöstedt on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left,	0.47594793715973727
B5-0179/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance	0.5099236453822105
on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a Romanian goldmine into the Lepos, Somes, Tisza and Danube Rivers.	0.47546277440093826
Mr President, we debated the framework directive on water this week, and the disaster in Romania has demonstrated once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water.	0.9450308005975141
This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union.	0.7680085438466234
We are delighted with the pledge that EU aid will be used to clean the rivers, and at least as important is the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in Romania and, more generally, in Central and Eastern Europe.	0.8034298689903857
We therefore welcome Commissioner Wallström' s brief visit, for it can contribute to this awareness.	0.8183405667960071
After all, this is a candidate country we are talking about, and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the EU environmental rules in time.	0.9017251389520959
The polluter ought to pay.	0.36872430737059486
I wonder whether the European Union can recoup this kind of cost from the environmental cowboys who appear in the so-called 'Wild East' , making use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place.	0.7625516761916383
I would be in favour of its doing so.	0.7836729455799325
Mr President, Commissioner, there has been one ecological disaster after another and, unfortunately, they are all similar.	0.7880150089473078
Once again, there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe.	0.5736683942512634
The delta of the Danube is in danger.	0.6515509549620551
As in Spain in April 1998, as in Brittany and the Vendée since last December, once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat.	0.6923987208392862
The European Parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger, which threatens our environment, upsets our ecosystem and again weakens our populations.	0.7058823062328723
This new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries.	0.7303480998823161
The authorities in these counties, which are still very frail from an environmental point of view, need to overcome numerous obstacles.	0.7632264698033744
First, they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites; then they need to have suitable technical means of curbing and containing this type of pollution and, finally, they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites.	0.7362830731544261
Today, the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted, which is why the European Union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with Community environmental protection standards.	0.8847574759700748
But, over and above that, it is the technologies and the means used to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which are being called into question.	0.8064850486485787
I hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility.	0.5793987445086288
The environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the European continent.	0.973962685472262
It must form the basis for our partners' political will.	0.6815443080260194
Implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop, it will also have social and economic benefits and, at the same time, public health standards will improve.	0.8175370208381324
The efforts already being made need to be stepped up.	0.5016391531340496
The European continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the 'polluter pays' principle.	0.6188296412221885
Mr President, when the Doñana disaster occurred, the non-governmental organisation, the World Wide Fund for Nature, gave us a report on the number of reservoirs of this type in Europe.	0.9593938411857416
The number is huge. They are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply, ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas.	0.5720719196908532
I visited Doñana after the spill and saw how agriculture, fishing and the lives of people in the surrounding area were enormously compromised.	0.5265423653449841
I therefore believe that the European Union must, to start with, carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoirs and compile a precise record of the number of these in Europe.	0.9676956165346282
We must bring these reservoirs under Community law and the directives on waste and we must use the precautionary principle to ensure that this type of event does not happen again.	0.7806539943945301
If we do not, we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent.	0.7801457990270801
Mr President, this disaster at the mine in Romania affects a large hydrogeological area with rivers and watercourses in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria, The fact that 100 000 m3 of cyanide-poisoned water and large quantities of heavy metals have leaked out into the ecosystem is going to have appalling consequences for people in the area for a very long time to come, as well as for animal and plant life, agriculture, the tourist industry, biodiversity and the whole of the ecosystem.	0.7480056502217317
It is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today.	0.6254060062541884
Is a substance as poisonous as cyanide really to be used in the mining industry and in the production of metals?	0.6341536669885958
The answer, of course, is an emphatic no.	0.7566394371081806
There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide.	0.6135507287275566
I assume, therefore, that the EU will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total, worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance.	0.865244856714509
It has already been banned in most EU countries for a long time now.	0.7248045789079713
That an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs.	0.6287537953552124
I have been informed that the Commissioner for the Environment, Margot Wallström, has travelled from Strasbourg to Romania in order to see for herself, on the spot, what has happened.	0.947608738804392
My Group assumes that Margot Wallström will promise to provide aid to those communities which have been affected: economic aid, support in terms of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning-up operation which is required.	0.6069534544611203
This highlights the need for something which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been demanding for an extremely long time, namely a rapid reaction force offering protection to civilians in the event of major environmental and industrial catastrophes of this type.	0.7020774822754885
It also sheds light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant States.	0.6294825221049456
We must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people' s health and the ecosystems.	0.5983133860523132
Mr President, I do not think we are in a position to throw stones at the Eastern European countries which have come knocking at the door of the European Union, because ecological disasters occur as much here, in the west, as they do in the east.	1.0192969750836554
For example, the overflow from the decanting basins at the gold mines in Salsigne, in France, have caused tremendous pollution and are a huge economic disaster even today.	0.6300319350832648
We know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions.	0.34044605661994
Who is going to pay?	0.44342916216398126
Which is why the environmental aspect, which is becoming a matter of urgency, must be taken into account in all development projects at all costs.	0.9637433757600282
I too should like to ask the European Union to put its own house in order here, i.e. to call on Member States which still have gold mines to commission expert reports, so that we know just what the situation is.	0.8950836721029175
I am thinking in particular of the gold mines in French Guiana, where the workers, who are generally women, are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions.	0.735879385494238
. Let me associate myself, not least as a former Environment Minister, completely and without any reservation whatsoever, with the expressions of concern by honourable Members.	0.7732071118360622
An objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage.	0.6968982638499429
But early reports suggest that the poisoning of the Lepos, Tisza, Somes and Danube Rivers is a very serious environmental tragedy.	0.5951623967044436
It has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days.	0.4742506527297163
No living organisms, from microbes to otters, have been spared.	0.740756465650503
Several Members have set out what seems to have happened.	0.5746722192638363
We have all seen some of the consequences on our television screens.	0.7210918397466958
Some environmental experts have put the environmental consequences of this disaster, at least so far as damage to the ecosystem is concerned, on a par with Chernobyl.	0.8502753239591192
It has affected the peoples of three countries - Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia.	0.6294027859424927
It is the Tisza, Hungary' s second river, perhaps its most beautiful and most loved by its people, that has borne the brunt.	0.733087809194493
As with all such disasters it is the long-term consequences that are the most pernicious.	0.7936136507753985
Some estimates suggest that it could take up to five years to restock the river.	0.5828483926534553
There is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish.	0.4378488995777487
We plainly have a responsibility to do everything we can, as rapidly as we can, to help cope with this catastrophe.	0.9985232994854155
That is certainly the view of my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, who I know would have wished to respond to this resolution in person today.	0.975731310818421
The reason she cannot do so is because, as some honourable Members have pointed out, she is in Hungary and Romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to tackle the crisis.	0.7639536715825729
We stand ready to do so.	0.36666770594484677
We contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently.	0.709629925131727
The Romanians have approached UNEF and OCHA, in Geneva, for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts.	0.7857407779223269
We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed. That is obviously crucial.	0.7076009750668956
It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it.	0.7000300590884753
It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged.	0.7875104094576054
There is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the Romanian authorities.	0.7803606562183087
This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested.	1.137686314557526
The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy.	0.594105933150046
It is mirrored in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be applied in this case.	1.0575047619913944
The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due.	0.5949653533130768
The Union has mobilised some EUR 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the Danube River basin.	0.7505450172120327
In the context of pre-accession aid to the region it may be possible to redirect some of the assistance we are giving under ISPAR and PHARE to tackle the most severe impact of this accident, as long as the polluter-pays principle is fully respected.	0.7449911996656553
We will want, in the longer term, to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster, above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place.	0.9694692162516546
The incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of European civil protection, along the lines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two Members today.	0.6443131624465984
But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis.	0.5572505007511841
As I have said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, is on the spot today.	0.9767191106167058
She will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit.	0.534473264176835
This has been an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future.	0.6198046018256839

(FR) The only reason we voted for the PSE-Verts/ALE-GUE/NGL compromise motion for a resolution is because this resolution allowed us to condemn the decision by the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its factory in Italy.	0.6328471802655579
However, the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and exacerbating unemployment.	0.9078283444797962
Moreover, it is all just words, because the Socialist governments, which are now in a majority in Europe, are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right-wing governments.	0.9956601510978225
The real problem is not finding a legal way of slightly complicating redundancy procedures, but banning them.	0.693406921222339
The only way of stopping the diabolical machine which produces capital gains on the one side and unemployment on the other is to ban redundancies in all large companies which are in profit, on pain of compulsory purchase, and to publish the accounts of large companies and subject them to the scrutiny of the workers and the general public.	0.9187640955848225
Society must have the means of enforcing its own agenda on large companies and their owners. The first item on that agenda is the eradication of unemployment.	0.7758877153249883
The sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone, without cutting wages, must be taken from the profits of large companies.	0.735397847613455
It is far more important for the majority of society than the waste involved in financial operations or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders.	0.7086768504415248
. (SV) I cannot support the present resolution because, in paragraph 8, an individual factory in Italy is singled out with the express wish that precisely this establishment should remain in place, while the current management is being advised to try to sell the factory to a European tyre manufacturer.	0.8221276494658313
It is not the European Parliament' s business to express an opinion on which factories in the European Union' s 15 Member States are to remain in place and which are to be shut down; to expand their work forces or reduce them; stay in the same location or else move; be sold or not be sold; and, in the case of those which are to be sold, to comment on whether they are to be sold to companies within or outside Europe.	0.8849832494454327
Ultimately, it is a question of different spheres of authority, where the European Parliament and its Members do not have any legal means of changing the current corporate decision or do not even have a particularly deep knowledge of the situation in the factory as it stands.	0.9092707935204233
The Swedish Christian Democrats would emphasise the value of the European Union' s and the European Parliament' s concentrating on their basic tasks and not undermining the value of their actions in these areas by also acting in areas outside their jurisdiction.	0.687714203338288

The next item is the report (A5­0030/2000) by Mr Viceconte, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission: 'Enhancing tourism' s potential for employment - follow-up to the conclusions and recommendations of the High Level Group on Tourism and Employment' [COM(1999)0205 - C5-0112/1999 - 1999/2115(COS)].	0.5973927350353303
, rapporteur.	0.2921759242020904
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the European Union' s delay and indecision with regard to the introduction of a fully-fledged Community policy on tourism, increasing attention is being paid to tourism as a sector capable of generating new jobs.	0.6311595014786656
One of the reasons for the Community' s interest is the structural flexibility of this sector of the employment market, which explains its attractiveness for women and young people, to whom it often offers their first experience of employment.	0.8473441285880793
The importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone is now aware of this - is nevertheless based more on personal experience rather than on verifiable statistical data.	0.7344199002671532
The fact that, due to the absence of sufficiently reliable and scientific statistical data, the tourist industry is in effect an unknown quantity has greatly limited the prospects of pursuing a consistent policy in this area and creating employment on a wider scale.	0.6657118183445622
It would be appropriate, therefore, to begin by summarising the impact of tourism on the lives of Union citizens and the desirability, in both economic and social terms, of promoting the European tourist industry.	0.9067494111139945
Firstly, I would remind you that the tourist industry is one of the infrastructures which any advanced society must have. Without it, institutions, business and the world of work could not function.	0.8326779916945272
Tourism must therefore be thought of as the whole range of goods and services required by individuals moving from their habitual place of residence and thus confers mobility, the characteristic feature of contemporary society.	0.6096195103162995
The term 'tourism' must no longer be solely perceived as synonymous with sun, sea and holidays, which has the effect of reducing the interest taken in the subject at institutional level.	0.7340168784813321
Secondly, I would like to explode a myth, taking as a starting point an apparent paradox, which is clearly highlighted by Eurostat figures: the main international tourist countries are not those traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, but on the contrary the most advanced nations, whose quality of life is one of their main attractions and most heavily promoted features.	0.7716456341723449
