We are able but the rest of the female population is not?	1.087034126013824
Here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics. Because women have to deal with different realities.	5.263315873748736
Because they have fewer opportunities.	2.7973971042470605
Because they have a different level of education.	2.85075883195717
Because they have to face social obstacles. Because they never have time to deal with matters of public interest.	4.727561497505419
The second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders.	3.633933175747332
Not necessary!	-0.0
They have all been persuaded!	2.2939393474191654
There is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women.	4.075057753915649
There is not one party, from the far left to the far right, which does not stress the need for women to take part.	4.031851996854683
On paper!	-0.0
Thirdly, we must expect things to change gradually.	4.540575805684576
The women' s conference in Beijing brought an important point to light.	4.009396938248569
With the rate at which the representation of women is developing at international level, it will take 2,300 years to achieve a balance between men and women.	4.2812268213284055
As far as Europe is concerned, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, where there is a quota for the involvement of women, it will take 25 years to achieve balanced representation.	3.332187938980808
The second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women.	3.1005633443605487
Quotas alone are not enough.	3.3093989357362754
If only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history.	7.153629811081228
On this we are clear.	2.516361592093005
Quotas are one of the ways, one of the policies needed to bring about change.	3.3929751834044497
Finally, on the question of whether, as the product of quotas, we can be proud, I would reply categorically that I would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that I had managed to impose quotas on Greece, where the level of representation of women is 5%.	4.432950431860925
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.	1.1865179062804914
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2).	1.963043645142134
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow morning.	2.376864536207427
Floods in Mozambique	-0.0
The next item is the Commission statement on flooding in Mozambique.	2.563330455998861
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	0.5431039271632084
The Commission is following with very great concern, as I know all honourable Members will be, the emergency situation in Mozambique.	4.7779731843318
The continuing torrential rains throughout the southern African region aggravated by the Cyclone Eline have led to the displacement of large numbers of people and there has been considerable damage to housing and infrastructure.	5.562299671614542
About 800 000 people appear to have been affected by the floods, about 300 000 are in urgent need of food and other types of humanitarian assistance.	4.975118648191606
Several people have lost their lives, many have disappeared, many have been injured.	4.382434987540305
The government of Mozambique has appealed for humanitarian aid from third countries.	4.744148388200007
The international community including the United States of America, Switzerland, South Africa, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands have to date provided substantial assistance.	3.5625368211601667
My colleague Poul Nielson is literally on his way to Mozambique this afternoon and evening together with the Portuguese Secretary of State to assess the situation on the ground.	6.124223552773212
Mr Nielson will be happy to report back to Parliament on the findings of his mission.	3.5179879270600205
Just before I say a word about the assistance which has been given by ECHO so far, perhaps I can be allowed to make three rather personal remarks.	4.840362900636599
First of all, from 1986 to 1989, I was an overseas development minister and I formed a particular attachment to the people of Mozambique.	5.129464288668552
They were bravely dealing then with huge environmental and political problems, with the problems of poverty and the consequences of a bloody war.	4.523467392497609
If ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was Mozambique.	7.272718627246236
Secondly, that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which Mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society.	4.855748189025911
Thirdly, we spent much of this afternoon in this Chamber discussing conflict prevention, how one could prevent crises happening or how one could respond to crises more effectively.	6.3706343147581475
We talked about the importance of the Commission developing a series of headline goals for non-military actions related to crises and, if I may say so, if ever there was a case where that is relevant, it is the disaster which has overwhelmed Mozambique.	4.804365821947259
Let me turn to the assistance provided so far.	3.7371586983155582
Last week ECHO decided to allocate EUR 1 million for flood relief, of which 600 000 will be dispersed through the Spanish Red Cross and 150 000 through MSF Luxembourg, for operations in Mozambique and EUR 250 000 to Botswana through the German Red Cross.	6.7796692379863694
These NGOs will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care, water and sanitation.	5.607377365840252
ECHO is currently preparing a second decision for a further EUR 2 million This decision will be implemented through UNICEF, Action Contre La Faim, COSV, Nuova Frontera and Vireaid pending, of course, the reception and examination of their final proposals.	6.2307882061636315
These NGOs will be concentrating on the areas of water and sanitation, provision of shelter, plastic sheeting, jerry cans, blankets, those sorts of things.	5.989241509118978
They will be concentrating on the reinstallation of displaced people, on the further prevention of outbreaks of malaria, cholera and other communicable diseases, on the provision of supplementary food to malnourished and children at risk, on the provision of seeds and tools, on food security, on the rehabilitation of essential animal health structures and on the training of village livestock promoters.	5.3438756858252585
A third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of Commissioner Nielson.	3.4183943650888517
The Commission is also preparing a medium-term Community response combining NGO co-financing with European Development Fund operations to help Mozambique to respond to the crisis situation in re-establishing the rapid pace of growth that Mozambique had worked so hard to achieve.	6.008305883758621
It is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to re-construction within a three to four years time horizon.	5.861860278076445
At times like this we are all aware of how much more we need to do to prevent disasters and to deal expeditiously with the disasters that we are not able to prevent.	4.416676604437993
I am not sure that I can add very much at this stage to the analysis of what went wrong and what we can do better but obviously we must learn any lessons that are required from this terrible calamity.	5.5401211432365765
I repeat, Commissioner Nielson will be happy to report to Parliament when he returns from Mozambique and the scene of the disaster.	4.808262526533695
Mr President, Commissioner, Mozambique is a young African country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy.	5.511021463851892
The credit for Mozambique' s success story must be shared equally by its government, by the opposition, but above all, by the people of Mozambique.	3.9396230614231738
There is a risk, however, that all the effort that has been made in recent years, after all the problems with the peace agreements, with which we are all familiar, will have been wasted as a result of the natural forces that have been unleashed on Mozambique over the last few weeks.	4.112034821853396
The current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying, as the Commissioner has already said: around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees, waiting for a helicopter to come and save them.	5.859989920346994
There have already been hundreds of deaths.	3.5715926192356755
The EU and some of its Member States, including my own, have provided emergency financial aid, perhaps a little later than they should have, but they have done so, as have the United States and various countries in the region, particularly South Africa.	4.102519367025982
It is now obvious that the main priority is for rescue helicopters, followed immediately by food aid and other emergency humanitarian aid.	6.37555800620154
Although these floods began three weeks ago, the whole world has finally begun to wake up to the dire straits Mozambique currently finds itself in: there are thousands of people whose lives are hanging by a thread and who will soon die unless we arrange transport, particularly air transport, to get them out of the situation they are in.	6.149490649050004
This is undoubtedly the greatest priority at the moment: search and rescue transport and emergency humanitarian aid, including food aid.	6.04381474252139
I would like to emphasise, however, that the EU and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to Mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing.	4.086650029683657
We must be aware of the aftermath of the floods.	3.5007877343491574
It is therefore now becoming urgent for us to start considering how we can find financial resources to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed and without which Mozambique cannot continue on the path towards development on which it set out a few years ago in such a promising way.	5.481275594093829
Rebuilding infrastructure is crucial, because otherwise there can be no development. It is also time for some creditor countries to think about writing off or reducing Mozambique' s debts.	5.861007684422368
If nothing is done now, we will be letting all the effort that we have made in the past to help Mozambique in its development go to waste.	5.409595212839267
I therefore hope that the visit by Commissioner Nielson and representatives of the Portuguese presidency this week will enable us to treat this extremely important issue with the seriousness it deserves.	5.0528307164759925
Mr President, it has already been said that, after a war which engulfed the country in misery, Mozambique is now facing a natural disaster of terrifying proportions.	4.795855160011273
Although it is currently impossible to calculate how many people have died, we do know that around 80 000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300 000 have lost their homes and crops.	6.063665731096391
They urgently need aid such as food, water and shelter in order to survive.	4.453118504297873
This immediate need will subsequently be replaced by a requirement for medicine to prevent epidemics, which have apparently already broken out, and aid for reconstruction.	5.954878749656045
However, the aid needed now is difficult to get through, despite the efforts of the NGOs, because the roads, bridges and railway lines are damaged.	4.480321547431232
Helicopters are therefore needed.	3.457386072535056
Apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about 80 000 people from trees.	5.856349501040173
The machinery mobilising the aid is too slow.	5.246914369022018
The PSE Group of this House has suggested that preventing natural disasters, including preventing conflicts, is the best way of avoiding situations like the one now being suffered by the people of Mozambique.	4.903343607425124
I must remind you in particular of the efforts of Mr Rocard during the previous term.	4.016144352375658
The European Commission responded in 1994 by setting up a disaster preparedness programme known as DIPECHO. This was intended to be proactive and, using a regional approach, to prevent disasters or at least to minimise their effects on the population.	5.497315703804979
However, Africa is surprisingly not included in the DIPECHO plans.	4.579012985349653
Mozambique, which is now suffering a foreseeable disaster, just as the famine now threatening in Ethiopia was foreseeable, is excluded from these plans.	5.6027826983659805
The DIPECHO agenda includes south-east Asia, Central America and the Caribbean.	4.706932830890443
This is reasonable and we support this, but we have to ask the Commissioner, why not Africa?	3.59615637205934
The PSE Group has always supported the Commission' s humanitarian aid policy.	3.4631137570540793
We have always supported ECHO, its policies and its actions, even some which have been disputed by certain bodies. We believe that solidarity must be the distinctive feature of the EU' s external action.	5.512796948224027
In view of all this, we also believe the time has come to demand a redoubled effort by the Commission and the Member States, on behalf of those who are now drowning in Mozambique.	3.6257705424412987
The EUR 1 million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the Mozambican Government at 65 million dollars.	5.405607635799209
The time has also come to demand greater efficiency.	4.548483361731246
We hope that the debate at the beginning of this afternoon, the Commissioner' s knowledge of the situation in Mozambique and the visit by Mr Nielson will lead to a major effort being made by all sides to help Mozambique.	3.652775581521912
Mr President, the situation in Mozambique is of the greatest urgency.	3.58064715226912
Each day, each hour of delay costs many lives.	4.912999715746284
There are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims. The water levels continue to rise.	5.244477233714809
Starvation and epidemics seem inevitable.	4.53901859469853
It is as if the whole world is looking on, helplessly.	4.254832778602586
The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness.	4.035834193434546
I must admit that I have my doubts about this.	2.7782849522653312
Commissioner Nielson is flying out today. In European terms, this may be swift action, but given the emergency in Mozambique, this is probably very late.	5.377820757179221
Unlike a number of Member States, the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far.	4.20661720014538
What options does the Commission have, to offer effective help fast?	5.0280314790111955
What could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of?	6.241284889375456
Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far?	5.556040499637661
Why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner?	4.618892572843772
The international community could also help Mozambique in an act of generosity by cancelling its debts, not only because the country has adopted a relatively sound policy, but especially because the extent of human suffering makes this absolutely essential.	6.01140904677201
Mr President, all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting Mozambique.	4.474785667465071
There are thousands and thousands of displaced persons, a large number of dead, a lack of food and drinking water, and homes and crops have been destroyed.	4.279696645031046
And this is happening in a country which, because it is one of the poorest in the world, does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary.	3.888263157217773
It is therefore vital for the EU and its Member States to intervene in a way which will enable us to provide this country and its people with rapid and exceptional help.	3.8326103794782536
We know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation, representatives of the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Nielson left today for Mozambique.	3.873152534591841
We are pleased about this development, but what is more crucial than their presence is that they should guarantee that a short and medium-term action plan will be adopted and implemented immediately. This should be done in conjunction with the Mozambican government and this plan must be able to secure the aid that the situation requires.	5.09627989924805
Furthermore, it was precisely for this reason, and also because I am convinced that what we really need now is urgent and exceptional action, that I spoke today to Commissioner Nielson - just before he left - in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. I asked him to join us, as soon as he returns, to inform us about how the situation is developing and particularly about the emergency measures which the EU has already taken, and those which we are going to take.	4.895605876066562
Thousands upon thousands of human lives are in danger at the moment, and only international solidarity can save them.	5.08151424020409
I would like to think that the EU is up to the task of providing the people of Mozambique with what they expect from us.	3.6751999437828604
Mr President, I would like to begin by emphasising, first of all, the timing and the topicality of this debate on the devastating floods in Mozambique.	3.57900303762912
Indeed, these floods and appalling weather have resulted in many thousands of people losing their homes and all of their possessions, people who cannot return to their homes after the storms, purely and simply because their homes and their belongings no longer exist. They are no longer there, having been swept away in the torrents.	5.694843107626712
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there remains, however, one immediate problem: the need to provide help for all Mozambicans who have been afflicted, many of whose lives are in danger, in their flooded villages, hoping that they will be rescued.	4.734617133371893
Most of these people can only be saved by aircraft, especially helicopters, of which it is clear that too few are in action.	5.378097846986502
As the President of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano, remarked in a dramatic appeal, each passing day may mean death for many Mozambicans.	6.3718263848638985
The EU must therefore mobilise resources immediately and effectively, in terms of quantity as well as quality, and it must employ the most rapid and appropriate means of achieving this.	5.5986896566340985
We must do this not only in line with basic humanitarian principles and out of solidarity, but also - and quickly - because we know that Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world. This means that its resources for coping with the tragedy and then setting about reconstruction are practically non-existent.	4.990451560486012
We are also under an obligation to help because of another fact, the fact that Mozambique is one of the few African countries to have used democratic means to recover from the bloody civil war by which it was consumed for several years after it gained independence.	6.035586332600611
It is true that Mozambique' s democracy is still far from perfect, as shown by the way in which the results of the recent presidential elections were contested and doubts were cast upon them.	4.785111255984834
But given this situation, which is so tragic for the people of Mozambique, we must not fail to provide an effective and appropriate response to the appeals of Mozambique' s leaders, both those in the government and those in opposition, who, out of a sense of responsibility, have resisted from resorting to violence again as a means of solving their problems.	4.421508060121662
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to add my voice to all those who have already spoken in order to draw this House' s attention - which was not really necessary, but it had to be done - to the appalling tragedy unfolding in Mozambique. I have some figures here, which I believe are the most up-to-date ones available.	4.1004701424625845
More than three hundred people have already died, six hundred and fifty thousand have become displaced, two million four hundred thousand people have been cut off, with eighty-five thousand needing to be evacuated, some of whom are in treetops, others on roofs.	6.068633695516678
As has already been said, helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid. Otherwise, apart from the tragedy created by the floods, the next tragedy will arise: that of a lack of aid to the people, who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods.	4.720191963001256
This would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all.	5.20447643236772
The Commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with Mozambique, as I have myself, and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake.	4.96597128039169
I hope that the mission by Commissioner Nielson and the Portuguese State Secretary will provide the information that this House needs in order to understand the current situation, and what the most urgent needs are, so that we can help the people of Mozambique, who genuinely deserve our help, in their struggle for development.	4.971447566255424
.	-0.0
Could I thank Commissioner Patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said, the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken Limpopo valley in Mozambique are absolutely heartbreaking.	5.674769770049724
Children have lost parents, families are bereft, hopeless, helpless and they have lost absolutely everything.	6.228882043553745
But of course, as others have said, this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate, woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness.	6.030057287778637
There is a case as the Commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place.	5.944907022291466
This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region.	6.530721615086463
The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet.	5.895517660661147
85% of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is.	4.373845369616349
Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing.	5.244631006829572
Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million.	4.453463076121982
We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there.	4.861791090313851
Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift.	3.6634534727954233
As you say tons of food, water purification equipment, tents, blankets.	4.713876235961994
Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources.	6.767439506840216
Are we ready to pay for those resources?	3.5745060509865314
Mozambique is, of course, one of the poorest countries in the world, but one of Africa' s great success stories with its work on economic growth, on poverty reduction, on democracy in spite, of course, of massive debt pressures.	4.524667502105258
Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured.	5.51592684519077
How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country.	5.714109063929282
Thank you, Mrs Kinnock.	2.391927248081715
Mr Nogueira, we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure.	4.4846549823323425
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
Union Economy (1999)	4.068040822874919
The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document 'The EU Economy 1999 Review' [C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)].	3.907664055318166
The report of the Commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the European economy which it finds promising, especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8% by the year 2001.	4.783853316590754
This picture in the opinion of your rapporteur has to be set against a background of sluggishness, of growth of only 1.9% per year throughout the 1990s, despite instances of higher growth rates during that decade which we were, however, unable to consolidate.	5.416919708967272
It would follow that if we do not wish the same old failures of the past to reassert themselves, we must use the current window of opportunity of improved economic performance in order to launch a new policy of transition into self-sustained higher growth levels in our economy.	6.104923931611371
This is the challenge.	1.943137011852325
Faced with this challenge the Commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal fundamentals of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents.	6.903675553296375
In Europe, in your rapporteur' s opinion, this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years, not just once but repeatedly.	4.783971772254972
Such an attitude has downside risks which I understand the ECOFIN Council is currently discussing.	5.216085022068989
These risks involve a correction in the US economy and the future trend in oil prices and in long-term EU interest rates.	6.301080354715003
Should any of these risks materialise in a negative fashion, what will be our response - more laissez faire or shall we have prepared ourselves better than in the last downturn?	5.945653007647916
It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts.	5.822658093904729
One is to adopt the Commission' s own excellent, outstanding econometric analysis, and ask the Council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected quantifiable targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible.	5.238962949822748
A central plank of such a programme should be the raising of the level of investment of capital formation from 19%, to which it has fallen over the decade, to at least 23-24% of GDP, both in the private and in the public sector.	4.374534079048519
To allow the public sector to take the necessary significant lead in investment policy, the Council would indeed have to sacrifice some of its most sacred cows.	5.67023068768449
It would need to revise its negative attitude towards the big infrastructure programmes of trans-European networks, which have been gathering dust in the drawers for rather too long, to allow them to be financed on an adequate scale by means of European Community bonds and to accept an interpretation of the concept of budget deficits which would allow governments to borrow for purposes of investment without falling foul of the restrictions of the stability pact.	5.673750345018689
This was the first pillar of my recommendation.	4.145436175800288
The second pillar consisted of embracing a large number of structural reforms, privatisation, de-regulation proposals, as well as suggestions facilitating the transition to a knowledge-based economy which, as we know, constitutes the backbone of the proposals of the presidency for the Lisbon Summit.	4.154175903311152
It has been repeatedly stated by expert opinion that the programme of structural reforms combined with an expansionary programme of investment and growth is capable of pulling the European economy out of its state of inertia while one-sided policies are condemned to fail.	6.237872758198186
Unfortunately my colleagues of the People' s Party aided and abetted by the Liberals in the Economic Affairs Committee found my approach unacceptable.	5.624364846753065
I am glad that at least after five years of insistence they have found the target of full employment acceptable but I must say that simply referring to full employment without proposing a concrete programme towards achieving the targets smacks too much of lip service and is too unconvincing to serve as the political message of optimism that people expect from us, have been expecting from us rather too long.	5.727125733093164
It is certainly not my task to judge other people' s alliances but if the People' s Party and the Liberals are so desperate to cement their alliance, let them at least propose something positive, something that has a chance of working, not repeat the same tired old platitudes, ideas that have so singularly failed us in the past, nor oppose other people' s concrete efforts just for the sake of opposing them.	5.800446820691309
I believe that the political message of this Parliament should consist of something more original than a mere rehash of the neo-classical economic mantra.	5.296825032142032
Something more robust than a call to surrender to the fatalities of the market economy, something more decent than opposing dutiful aims but denying them the means of their realisation.	6.114167925325897
The report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects.	4.826071015889622
Unless it is restored in its original form by Parliament, accepting the amendments retabled by the Socialist Group, I must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my Socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that Parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience.	6.0170384062727695
Mr President, Mr Katiforis' passion and conviction have prevented him from carrying out the usual task of a rapporteur in plenary which is to defend his report.	6.215896818946847
Instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee.	5.420194976168295
We clearly have different views, one of which is that we believe the development of the European economy can be regarded with confidence.	3.7129483333904028
Yesterday, when speaking to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Commissioner Solbes specifically indicated that the prospects for this year and next for the European economy are excellent.	4.628119293039241
Moreover, several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus.	5.496650845989887
They are having to choose, for example, between reducing taxes or reducing the public deficit, but clearly avoiding any price rises, or - so there is no misunderstanding - creating a special reserve for future situations in which welfare may be needed, given the EU' s population growth.	5.217911771314796
We are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the Union, now and in the coming years. It must be taken into account that we have an open, globalised and very competitive economy.	4.709977470197171
In order to reach and even overtake the leading position of the United States of America, we must avoid interventionism, as proposed initially by Mr Katiforis, and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures.	5.251960232636566
Furthermore, the Member States refused to contribute more funds when we discussed Agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at Union level.	4.707592576503209
However, we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws.	4.173977190533211
There are still sectors such as air transport, energy and telecommunications in which, if we compare our unit cost with that of the USA or other countries which are equally competitive at international level, the cost supported by our companies is very high.	5.1623487869613465
This report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the USA is EUR 500 and in the European Union, on average, it is EUR 1 600.	3.9842271794087027
We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention.	4.0453760597224955
It is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the European Union.	5.233898407930466
Mr President, the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in Mr Katiforis, in my view, only served to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people, social outcasts and those living a precarious existence in our European Union.	4.725421007743527
This is the objective, in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament: give hope to the people of Europe.	3.782187748987773
There is indeed economic recovery, but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe.	5.248721606392187
The votes of the PPE-DE and the Liberals have very considerably diminished, and even reversed, the meaning of his message.	5.863736011419044
That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment.	3.8289410618347826
What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report?	4.396412200674495
First of all, the affirmation that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, that particularly respects the commitments of the European Union at the conferences in Kyoto and Buenos Aires.	5.106951273059976
There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year 2008, by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions.	4.542551375000229
A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport, energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet.	4.708192114549103
Secondly, even the growth rate of 3 or 4%, something we consider eminently feasible, will not be sufficient to reduce unemployment if we do not improve the job content of this growth.	4.821229883943325
And we should say so very clearly, it will involve more savings on services, more third systems, more reductions in average working hours, whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things.	6.167636595470247
Thirdly, we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in Europe, but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital.	5.063844721033511
The lesson learned from the European experience is that where wages are lowest, where the salary ratio is the most flexible, unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest, where the social relations are the best regulated, the unemployment rate is the lowest.	6.382828603452474
Mr President, I think that this policy will engender not hope, but deep disappointment in European workers.	5.076923585742081
The vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the European Commission, ECOFIN and the Central Bank, but also the European Parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo-liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the Member States of the European Union.	5.006777384549946
Our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the European Union and to send the Commission and the Council the sort of message which the European Parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the European Union.	4.59078673364032
Even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high-level experts, who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas, failed miserably to muster any support.	5.089442146835793
With this vote, the European Parliament has accepted serious liability towards the people who elected it, by supporting an extreme neo-liberal economic and social policy; a policy which promotes the privatisation of absolutely everything, categorically opposes any form of public sector, overturns workers' employment, wage, social and insurance rights, imposes a policy of budgetary austerity which is acutely anti-social and unpopular and acts on behalf of employers by asking workers to become more attractive and employable if they want to find a job.	5.830927885706468
Our Group categorically condemns this perception and, in this sense, does not intend to support this resolution.	3.743807503279775
It will be voting against it.	1.8695756614655303
Mr President, the report presented by the Commission on the Union Economy in 1999 appears to us to be mostly utter waffle as it scarcely shows why our performance remains hopelessly below the potential that the immense human resources of Europe should allow.	6.058750457304069
Indeed, it is good to note that the forecast of 3% growth for the year 2000, which could have seemed rather bold when the Commission announced it in November 1999, now has a serious chance of being achieved, even in the context of continued inflation, since the peak of 2% for the euro zone in January, nevertheless remains quite minor compared with the past.	4.848863771041028
But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps.	4.590793626559603
We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility, the excessive mandatory levies.	5.594487934891198
But let us not forget that there is another one, a new handicap, with the single currency.	3.5635597861522244
In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances.	6.208935216359002
This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission' s report.	3.825568334376748
But, in reality, we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation.	3.3290563258978856
If you add the strangeness of a single currency that is not built upon a State, itself based upon a people, you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the markets' suspicion of the euro.	5.952905502163064
Indeed, it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999, as it favoured growth in an unexpected way, but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is, in fact, symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions.	4.528376725562529
Mr President, the present draft resolution is controversial. Given the topic it covers, this is hardly surprising.	5.648109771586626
It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned.	3.9471399438544683
The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment, but it is, in fact, a short-term policy.	4.462057652323384
Even if he advocates sustainable growth, sustainability does not come into it.	5.195271565072463
Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy.	3.5578833003284274
More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity.	5.409404421366238
The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced	3.638844164290358
Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes.	5.735090554317622
If Member States do not do anything about this, there will be even fewer means for care, education and other important public amenities in the future.	4.5791319394225365
An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd.	5.373229902194862
It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which, at 2%, is now at its maximum permitted level.	5.482714666729567
If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again.	4.673462585044817
What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular.	4.1049918683367554
High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting.	3.7888474812620085
Promoting employment, however, is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy.	4.067024890231179
Member States, in particular, should adopt an effective policy.	2.915083455519562
In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway.	2.1244454025665243
Rigidity by imposing social convergence criteria and other Community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs.	5.001749028223003
However, shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution.	4.93670739558844
Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us. Not the report he presented to us here today, but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because politically speaking, these are two completely different reports.	4.217052816480323
In very general terms, we could call the first report a left-wing one, as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones. The report we have before us now and which Mr Katiforis is reluctant to defend - and I think that he is right in this - is a hybrid report, from which the main conclusions have been removed, and is based on social concerns.	5.226845255924389
What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report?	5.2805397933321245
He proposed an ambitious report, based on an optimistic Europe, which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve.	5.478961206087215
And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets.	4.533877899158404
Why, for example, was the proposal to increase Europe' s active population to 75% of the total population removed, when we currently have levels of around 60%?	4.910682563050092
An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries' levels of production with such a low rate of employment.	5.593677240146481
We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive.	5.501897239684065
As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training.	4.8970181589713375
We also need investment to grow at a faster rate.	5.234049775967519
We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce.	3.1016887219388694
I would like to counter this with the example of Portugal, where employment laws are not flexible, and where unemployment stands at less than 5% - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing, with Community support of course, at a rate considerably higher than the Community average.	5.326611128101634
What we want, therefore, is for Europe to enjoy economic growth, but also be prepared to address social issues.	3.8586926444219958
Mr President, like many others, I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report.	3.1823702939144933
When I read the report and see the picture of the EU' s economy that is described there, I think it is quite a worrying picture.	4.03780714292574
Investment levels are too low, unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth.	4.166246988499109
It is not, therefore, perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies, in spite of rumours to the effect that the European Central Bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it.	4.633896211370762
The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself, which is something I agree with.	2.8252385295438884
There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development.	3.2582444490532994
As far as I am concerned, EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy.	5.679508285514183
My conclusions about this differ completely, however, from those of the previous speaker.	4.297373795798935
I believe we have to place our confidence in human resources, partly through a macro-economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly - and perhaps above all - by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training, democratisation and good social conditions.	5.803875293044517
In this context, I can, in fact, see the EMU project' s main weakness, for it is true that you cannot act like Superman and raise the European economies from above.	4.528640895039214
Instead, you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the Member States.	3.7721601476744184
Mr President, Commissioner, I have the feeling that some of the previous speakers have not read the 1999 annual report on the Union economy in its entirety and have made a conscious decision not to listen to my Group' s spokesman, Karl von Wogau, for the document that we are debating today, and which has had a report written on it, points to the fact that the introduction of the euro has been a success.	3.4839994442010953
It points to the problems experienced in 1999, when, notwithstanding the problems, there was currency and price stability, increased employment, the beginnings of a period of upturn, and it was possible to make a start on reducing unemployment.	4.744339341097181
In terms of outlook, the document points to an upswing, to long-term prospects and the measures required to achieve this, which Karl von Wogau then proceeded to enlarge upon.	5.753385055565598
I am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one, for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy.	4.4864410987810155
We want to continue along the successful European path to growth and employment and a functioning internal market, to hasten our progress and supplement this with the necessary measures.	4.399059411028672
The left-wing of this House does not want to continue along this path, rather it makes dramatic statements such as: what we need is state intervention, not the extension and consolidation of the market economy.	4.899375057122507
State intervention has always led to a high level of debt, and a higher level of debt has always damaged growth and employment, as well as social justice.	4.986266207142047
That is what the debate we are having is all about, on the subject of which I have this to say to you: we need more freedom and less state intervention.	3.727000485850544
It is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment.	5.301305240687424
Mr President, the economic situation of the European Union from the viewpoint of the workers is eighteen million unemployed people, it is the generalisation of insecurity, of low wages, of deteriorating working conditions.	4.736607096061114
The Commission has the cynicism to consider wage restraint as a positive factor, whereas in France alone, over three million workers receive a salary that is close to the poverty line and they barely survive any better than the other three million people kept unemployed by an insane economy.	6.3822423534227015
But you never speak of restraining the income of shareholders that is infinitely higher from the outset and which increases shockingly every year.	6.710341698384821
What you have as a result are all these major trusts that cut jobs while their profits are high, and which often make staff redundant simply to make their share price rise on the stock market.	6.610959876044776
Eleven thousand job losses at Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, twenty two thousand at Unilever, ten thousand at ABB/Alsthom Power, not to mention all the others.	6.864100735767595
The economic growth on which you pride yourself only benefits a fortunate minority, the owners and shareholders of the large industrial and banking groups.	6.192285524857577
But beware of the backlash from the workers and the unemployed, who we keep telling that everything is getting better and better while they find that their lives are not improving but, on the contrary, are getting worse.	5.265576064772363
This is the key ideological struggle for Europe facing us.	5.076474413147786
This debate, I think, has summed it up.	3.1464681640319743
The key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening, and it is no surprise that this issue has polarised the debate in a House which is known for its consensus and its carve-out politics, and I am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear, because this report is a radical one.	5.438709551072867
This report is a wake-up call to Europe.	1.778130171021961
This report recommends radical measures, which in essence will make it easier to employ people.	5.23781394994441
It is as simple as that.	2.882400851600964
The reason why we have such crippling unemployment rates in Europe is that it is too difficult in many cases to employ people because of the red tape and the regulation and the inflexibility of the labour markets.	5.392442857599123
This is the only way to go forward, because the real way to deliver social justice in Europe - and after all that is what we are all here to do - is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs.	4.170251564363553
This report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that, because Europe has to wake up.	4.339513814514632
It cannot create jobs just by government spending.	5.5063354978825645
It cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours, as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people.	6.807126216103608
The real world simply does not work like that.	4.1927766254491114
And if Europe wants to be left behind, left behind to stagnation and to unemployment and to statism and to corporatism, than yes, vote against this report tomorrow.	5.006388364191527
But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe, then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report, because it will deliver those jobs, and it will deliver those opportunities, and it is the only way to do so.	4.659733388870107
Mr President, the original version of the Giorgos Katiforis report had the great merit of making strong recommendations, based on the precise observations of the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe, for a European Union strategy capable of giving continuity and stability to the sustainable development prospects emerging this year for all the countries of our continent.	5.121646229412249
These recommendations concerned the need for effective coordination of the Union' s economic policies and the need to overcome the way that economic policy is managed separately from social policy, which has hitherto been a serious barrier to the definition of a coherent strategy for fighting unemployment and moving towards full employment.	4.888069430273641
It is this absence of management of the European economy which is responsible, my dear Mr von Wogau, for the fall of the euro.	3.707388527973933
The report also contained recommendations concerning the creation of a European research area and the promotion in all countries of the Union of converging measures on research, lifelong learning and employability which would overcome any sort of unfair competition between the States in the field of taxation.	4.498166186835965
Lastly, the recommendations also incorporated an updated version of the proposals in President Delors' White Paper on the promotion of a European project for the development of a common network of infrastructures and services.	5.015392301697003
These recommendations, which, for the most part, are consistent with the guidelines in the Portuguese presidency' s work programme and which will therefore be discussed at the Lisbon Summit, have been rejected or distorted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament, by a majority which only managed to achieve a fragile unity in its rejection of the idea of a European Union which is founded on the convergence of national policies and not just on the grouping together of markets.	4.027921131060164
Mr President, this Parliament, which has shown itself to be highly Europeanist so many times, must, on this occasion, show that it can express a majority vote for a political union of Europe which is capable of dealing with market weak spots and failures.	4.06613910271897
Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report is exciting.	4.352114869687981
In its original form, it points the way towards a renewed economic policy which aims at something more than merely tightening up and balancing the economy.	6.19236522790759
Now, finally, the EU' s position is, of course, such that we can achieve high growth and seriously take up the fight against unemployment without jeopardising objectives such as price stability and a balanced budget.	4.424351295326505
It is therefore sad that, in committee, the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party should have voted down the proposals which take the fight against unemployment seriously.	3.244853208767296
The debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this.	4.128437414553428
It is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals, namely that the Union' s economic policy ought to prioritise investments, partly in order to involve all the Union' s citizens in the information society, something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view.	4.397156950645675
I am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant States' links with trans-European networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and IT infrastructure.	4.180924658874882
This is important for growth but also in order to avoid gulfs developing between people, both within the EU and between the EU and the applicant States.	3.9400480104389772
The applicant States ought not merely to tag along behind but, instead, share the EU' s ambition of becoming a world leader in the communications field.	5.051563060154664
Society needs, therefore, to take responsibility for the rapid and vigorous expansion of a modern IT infrastructure which also reaches small companies, poor regions and ordinary citizens.	5.373774551531425
We have that opportunity right now. Let us grasp it.	5.767396717066593
Mr President, the advantage of speaking at the end of such a debate is that you can react to what has been said before.	3.6900839231188263
I would like to say that I strongly disagree with Mrs Villiers' view that this is such an interesting debate.	3.7119911519437494
I think that the European Parliament is doing itself absolutely no favours by thinking only in terms of old categories and churning out old political concepts and visions.	6.14781049850135
It would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision.	4.346977979166721
I think that, in this way, the European Parliament is excluding itself from the discussion at the very moment that an extremely interesting development is taking place in the European Union where a very wide, socio-economic agenda is being drawn up much more clearly.	4.557800160523105
The Portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in Lisbon.	5.020686452834917
The Commission has done this in its five-year plan by listing one of the four priorities.	5.296057144870059
The Commission document too, which is being drafted for the summit in Lisbon, takes precisely such a wide approach which covers different areas.	5.410843933754994
I think that in adopting this wide socio-economic approach, the European Union is taking exactly the right line, not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted.	5.069600683323286
In this light, I think that the European Parliament' s role will be limited in Lisbon, but also in the forum in June for which we might have an invitation, but are unsure as to the input we can have.	4.229720934807572
Are we going to have nothing more to report than the fact that we are still stuck in a mould of old political contradictions?	5.326687271031538
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I must thank this House for its serious and detailed work.	2.6461299606164355
There is no doubt that the hearings of experts and the debates in committee have provided us with additional high-quality information.	4.488692913577783
There is also no doubt that, throughout the debate this afternoon, we have heard differing opinions about the possible policies.	4.404717491482058
However, I believe that there are also some elements of consensus.	3.218153664231415
We all agree that the current economic conjuncture is good.	3.982754204422262
We also agree about trying to further and benefit from this situation in order to improve conditions and about aiming for a definite improvement in employment.	4.784643695639318
I will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which I regard as the essential issue in today' s debate.	4.20725577594852
Yesterday, as some of you have noted, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in Europe.	2.691284206644734
We currently believe that this improvement, which we highlighted in the perspectives in November, may lead to even better results than initially forecast.	5.5577569178562225
Employment is growing at a good rate.	3.812413825596531
Despite yesterday' s figures, we certainly consider that the fact that inflation was around 2% in December shows that this is an issue which must be pursued. However, the rate of underlying inflation demonstrates that the inflationist tendencies are due to certain very specific elements such as the rise in oil prices and exchange rate developments.	4.870429343484793
When we submitted our report, we referred to the risks posed by growth.	4.705765345301435
We basically highlighted the possibility of encountering difficulties in terms of growth in the USA, and therefore in other parts of the world, and of a sudden rise in inflation.	3.848881978677184
This latter issue may be particularly significant if it causes cost-push inflation. This is why we are continuing to talk about the need for a wages policy compatible with the definitions of inflation which we want to establish.	4.986248142312655
Parliament' s analysis has highlighted another issue which is the development of risk in the stock markets.	3.701441087323898
The Commission regards this as significant although we do not believe that this is the basic problem.	4.342153843250567
Anyway, we currently have some excellent opportunities to do more.	4.183770619055534
We all agree that, after a decade of very weak growth and intolerable unemployment, certain action must be taken.	5.089277099077514
We need public and private investment.	3.2703934177578984
Our levels of research and development are too low compared with our competitors and our low level of employment reflects, among other factors, the imbalances in our labour market.	5.018195884818296
Our aim must therefore be to make this reactivation of the economy long-lasting with strong growth and job creation.	5.805266332828171
The latter element continues to be the Commission' s fundamental objective, as we indicated in the Prodi document submitted for your debate at the Lisbon Summit, in that we are aiming for full employment in the medium term.	4.727654397133171
What policy should we use to achieve these objectives?	3.491201583901281
In our opinion, the Union' s economy is reactivating but we still have idle production capacity, not only in terms of physical capital but also new sources of jobs.	4.124268353827849
The policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully absorbed.	5.9415457321949035
We must define a macro-economic policy which aids growth.	4.650485362431603
This is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth' s sake.	5.1226995191967415
It is simply a budgetary policy which can be coherent with price stability but which also allows us to have an appropriate monetary policy which contributes to growth.	4.981740481731435
This policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will lead to growth.	5.016156618287352
The EU' s potential for growth must pay particular attention to certain factors, on most of which I believe we agree with Parliament' s analysis.	3.603883201471895
Firstly, private investment must be assisted.	3.9639809123083376
The Union must help to promote the spirit of enterprise and to generate employment in this way, but without forgetting public investment.	4.231690284337329
This has been the major victim in recent years and any improvements in public finances must lead to improvements in public investment. However, this must be carried out with respect for our tax consolidation commitments.	4.664677279235694
Our main support in the future must be for research and development and human capital.	4.834473775861038
These are two of the principal challenges for the Lisbon Summit.	3.3576907804697758
It is essential that we tackle these challenges with quantified objectives and specific definitions. This will ultimately allow us to achieve our goal of clear improvements in productivity, thus enabling our society to grow, together with a rise in employment which will go some way towards making up the ground lost in recent years.	5.457129374969436
This is the policy which the Commission has defended and will continue to defend in Lisbon.	4.205482068868384
Common fisheries policy	-0.0
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	0.5807876034932212
A5-0038/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community framework for the collection and management of the fisheries data needed to conduct the common fisheries policy (COM(1999) 541 - C5-0302/1999 - 1999/0218(CNS));	3.9471877779091074
A5-0037/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on a financial contribution from the Community towards the expenditure incurred by the Member States in collecting data, and for financing studies and pilot projects for carrying out the common fisheries policy (COM(1999) 551 - C5-0303/1999 - 1999/0224(CNS)).	4.051578938737133
The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome.	3.989508310096536
So is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other.	4.500224554450174
I understand that they have been some five years in their gestation.	3.576742156436124
With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002, it is important that swift progress is now made.	3.7521151600708986
To take first the proposal for the Council regulation, this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations.	6.246543827038429
Both biological and economic information are included.	5.290616114475926
The proposal also makes provision for Member States to produce such data in aggregated form.	5.5064524990340775
Exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation.	6.035591017342517
The implementing regulation will establish a minimum Community programme and an extended Community programme.	6.115968626504709
It appears that these programmes will not cover the whole range of potential data but will be selective, for example, by type of fish stock.	4.898394350671176
The proposal for the Council decision allows for the making of the financial contribution by the Community to Member States engaged in the collection and management of data.	4.921141395624239
It also allows the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects.	4.57380824472009
The only apparent sanction for Member States that do not completely fulfil the requirements of the minimum programme under the regulation is that they will not be eligible for any financial assistance in respect to the extended programme.	5.250842984712329
Two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the Committee.	3.957929610560648
The first relates to the degree of involvement of the Commission.	1.2606308297397197
The original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations.	6.069043255921237
The Commission would only receive a copy of any such transmissions if it requested one.	6.272262027199621
Since, however, the Community is funding the exercise, it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment.	4.932210983972864
Thus, Amendment No 6, while maintaining the freedom of Member States to transmit the data to international organisations, requires that it also be sent annually to the Commission.	5.128685975408805
This change is taken in conjunction with Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 7.	3.5549106003533595
Amendment No 1 clarifies the point that, although the data are to be scientifically based, they are being collected for wider decision-making purposes.	5.442771643743983
Amendment No 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally.	4.716616002129763
Amendment No 7 calls on the Commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation.	5.030296309124185
It is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the Commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole.	5.652284274742481
The other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation.	4.651237919069721
First, in respect to economic data, Amendment No 2 makes two changes.	4.633528814741936
One attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued.	5.293247448037808
The other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue, subsidies, interest received, etc., with a reference simply to volume of sales.	5.299605933813711
It is considered that without these changes undesirably high costs in the collection of data could be incurred in Member States and that there could also be serious problems of confidentiality.	5.53044482384368
In conjunction with these changes, Amendment No 5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly.	4.194112626908145
Secondly, in respect to the environmental data, the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information.	5.422746532451916
The Commission has, however, made it clear that it intends itself to engage in studies and pilot projects of a wider environmental kind.	4.0136561190580595
It has also made it clear that it may wish to extend the range of data being collected by Member States at a later stage.	4.214330434366679
Amendment No 3 brings into the ambit of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems.	6.441870663897204
This will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary.	5.46972537311109
It should be stressed that the Amendment does not in any way require the Commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes.	4.963619064588349
It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish.	4.041501381048739
As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts.	4.962654207092584
The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes.	3.3812899512944994
The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects.	4.522349597516695
There are some minor amendments: Amendment No 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to Member States can cover not only the costs of collection of data but also those of its management, compilation, aggregation, etc. Amendments Nos 3 and 6 aim to smooth the timescale given that Member States will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programmes actually involve; and also to bring the timescale into line with the dates and the regulation.	4.994781581947006
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority.	4.508412149139497
More significantly, under Amendment No 1, the Fisheries Committee accepts the recommendation of the Budgets Committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1(b) rather than heading 3 of the Financial Perspective.	5.294509090323596
Although in its preliminary draft budget the Commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 'Internal Policies' , Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion.	6.093820925404694
This provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available.	4.163472973228345
) Mr President, I believe we totally agree with Mrs Attwooll' s statement at the beginning of her excellent report that these two Commission proposals, intended to shed more light on the scientific and socio-economic situation of the fisheries sector, come at a critical time.	4.430785078806504
The proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner.	4.476650390650114
This will only be true, of course, if the data can actually be obtained because, as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur, the Commission' s proposal does not establish any element of compulsion on the Member States.	4.025591048761732
The sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance, which is not very significant anyway, will not be received.	5.254115503889329
In view of our experience of the submission of data in the fisheries sector, as evidenced by the reports on compliance with the MAGPs, I believe that instead of obtaining a full picture of the situation in the sector, we will end up with total confusion. For example, some Member States will provide scientific data but not employment data while others will provide data on employment but none on the situation of resources, according to whether they can or want to obtain and send this data.	4.732373280675027
I am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management. This has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory, as with the MAGPs.	6.247965894224213
In view of this problem, which seems to me to be the most serious, the Fisheries Committee report improves the proposal in certain important points, particularly with the rapporteur' s suggestion of more reasonable submission deadlines and the request for monitoring by the Commission.	4.902330034960735
My Group has included two reasonable requests.	4.58470604625118
The first is that data originating from studies and samples should be used as a source of data whose collection could otherwise be interminable. The second is that the requirement for data referring strictly to the taxation of enterprises should be removed from the Commission' s proposal, bearing in mind that this tax data does not come within the Community competence.	4.884871777665945
As a result, this report is very satisfactory and, on behalf of my Group, I therefore ask for its approval.	3.1875381562546887
I wish at the outset to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report.	5.654850667983248
I welcome the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish.	4.504369378072494
It is important, of course, that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various Member States must be standardised across the Community and, as stated by the rapporteur in her report, must be in compliance with international provisions.	4.169232779537799
I welcome the availability of funding for national programmes, even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met.	4.68905612278184
I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission.	3.727360856073818
Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue.	6.218885058072053
Sound, factual information is in the best interests of the industry.	3.8484900980586256
I believe that the streamlined information to be made available will be of major benefit and importance to the decision makers and to their advisers and will go some way to ensure a more sustainable fishery that will continue to provide jobs in parts of the Union where there is no alternative source of employment.	5.854524579727113
I am pleased to confirm that in my country they are working to ensure that the detailed practicalities, the logistics and utilisation of information are developed in the best interests of the resource of the industry and decision makers and our Group has no difficulty in supporting these reports.	5.025504213103774
Mr President, behind the report, which is an honest one, by Mrs Attwooll, which we shall vote for, we see the European fisheries policy. It is not easy to manage because clearly in an open sea, which is immense and without borders, it is not easy to manage fish on the move.	4.61700826597323
We are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice.	4.881685032245155
It is indeed a good idea to wish to prevent the depletion of fragile resources, but what is the point if Europe restricts its catches and world catches increase?	5.444187937350261
What is the point of banning European drift nets in the île d' Yeu or elsewhere, if Japan, Korea and Tunisia use them and land fish here which we are not allowed to catch?	5.267017736949822
What is the point of destroying the French fishing fleet, at Sète or elsewhere, for example, if every year France has to spend two billion euros on importing fish caught and landed, while our fishermen are not allowed to catch it.	5.960014533220589
What is more, the movement of fish is like CO2 or like capital, it is not European, but world-wide.	4.789041031209783
Brussels, which wanted to do away with nations on the pretext that they were unsuited to the task, now in turn finds itself unsuited to managing a resource which itself is an international asset.	5.10075637066639
Together with Mrs Attwooll, I am in favour of collecting scientific data, and of fair and accurate checks, on condition that they do not vary according to the severity or the laxness of the administrations. I am in favour of enlightened management by marine scientists, like Professor Aubert, or others, that will make it possible to discover that the basic problems are not so much to do with industrial fishing - although it plays a serious and negative part - but more to do with plankton, the large underwater hot mass or cold mass rivers, which have a much greater effect than human influence.	5.709512356727001
But to enlighten the decision makers, let us practise honest science, without the ulterior motive of having the European Union finance excuses to destroy our fishing boats.	6.328066899679589
For if we must preserve the shoals of fish, we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen.	3.6235410191159296
Instead of always following behind the United States, in Seattle, in Kosovo, in Iraq, perhaps the Europe of Brussels could suggest, over and above the international fishing organisations that exist in the North Atlantic, in the Pacific, over and above the regulation of tuna, cod or other things, that Europe should take the initiative and organise an international conference on fishing, a kind of Montego Bay of the fisheries resources which would be held between Peruvians, Japanese, Canadians, Russians, Europeans, and we could manage the fisheries resources scientifically as an asset common to humanity.	5.485054637203222
That would be good internationalism as opposed to the bad internationalism, as practised with the free exchange areas and other false friends of the OECD.	5.883972080344594
The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union.	5.328166270507483
They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing.	6.150844578625262
The recent decisions on the cod quota for the Irish Sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the Northern Ireland fishing industry.	6.055219791105894
I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland, a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue.	5.06721694454689
The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves, which have been totally rejected out of hand, for the conservation of their own fish stocks, then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard.	5.480508390841682
At a recent visit in Brussels these fishermen' s representatives, duly accredited, travelled from Northern Ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared.	6.518671710389375
That is scandalous, their case ought to be heard.	5.27085413944879
It should be put on record, and I want to put it on record today.	3.9218855702926723
I sat in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the Irish Sea and at that very time haddock had a special, spectacular increase of breeding in the Irish Sea so the scientists can be wrong.	7.061243449891871
As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ruination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union.	6.027155072097458
Mr President, Mrs Attwooll' s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the Member States. This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002.	4.491330833883741
However, the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the Commission' s proposal.	4.685945703891897
This has happened, as previously mentioned, with the MAGPs. These have seriously prejudiced the countries which have strictly complied with them and provided the corresponding data to the Commission, compared with other countries which have failed to comply or simply not provided the data.	5.2215049110910625
It should be pointed out that not all the Member States have the same amount of data.	2.915923865461982
Some have different sectors and, in view of the volume of data to be sent, could be prejudiced compared with those which have a smaller volume of data, if the same deadlines are set.	4.714193657025028
These deadlines for submission must therefore be staggered accordingly.	4.979371567970316
Much of this data is confidential, as has also been mentioned, which could affect the competitiveness of the sectors involved and their enterprises.	4.506507709003742
We must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data.	3.9524931143824964
Some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises.	4.450599936574895
Finally, Mr President, as I must be brief given the time constraints, I must congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, on the important work which she has carried out within our committee.	4.290772657805447
I too want to congratulate Mrs Attwooll and say that I agree with most of what she said.	4.5109422318222245
I regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States.	4.39400666426004
I cannot understand the proposal to make a regulation out of which it is possible for some Member States to slip without any penalty and I cannot understand either that within a European Union where we are only 50% self-sufficient in fish for our domestic needs that there is any highly sensitive information, that by making the reports that are necessary that the national interest or the regional interest of some states or fishing communities is going to be put at risk.	5.4254295983391065
In view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information, economic as well as biological.	4.759143706797913
In the past somebody said to me I have been defending the decisions the Commission makes.	6.072360191372346
It is not very easy in coastal areas anywhere in the Union to defend the European Union in the whole area of fisheries, but I have been defending them on the grounds that decisions are made on properly based scientific knowledge.	4.833635480319139
I am informed when I take a closer look that the information is in fact quite higgledy-piggledy with bits coming from here and there and no clear, proper economic and biological picture emerging.	6.839002622539484
If we do not have this picture then it will not be possible to make reasonable decisions in two years' time about the future of the policy.	4.477549808368072
It is not easy, indeed I could speak for everybody in my constituency that live in the coastal areas too and say that they are agreed on one thing, that the European Union is the source of all their problems and all their difficulties.	4.997968339286766
Well, I do not agree with them but I think if we do not base our information and our decisions on good scientific information, and if there is not an equal obligation on everyone to give it, then we will have bad decisions.	5.199750946343706
Mr President, Commissioner, no one could dispute the usefulness of implementing the qualitative and quantitative data on the fishing industry, particularly in view of the reform of the CFP in 2002.	3.904231561318079
We are also of the opinion that Community funds should be set aside to fund these activities.	4.46895820475489
A common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements.	5.594162357456559
To this end, more extensive, compatible, uniform data is required, and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the Union' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted.	5.048582776964857
However, we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities, differences, varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries, and that they will not be disregarded, penalised or even eliminated due to the misinterpretation of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies, as has sometimes occurred in the past.	4.874473061631766
A case in point is the Mediterranean, including my country' s fishing industry.	3.3777962226041827
After years of the CFP for the Mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid, Regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy, with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation.	6.139057924011612
This is a worthy objective, the implementation of which, however, has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of Mediterranean species of fish.	4.729316703589174
A subsequent regulation, Regulation 1448, adopted, not by chance, in 1999, permitted certain exemptions, in particular for special cases.	4.838758500242638
The time period will elapse on 31 May next, to be precise, when the Commission will present a proposal.	4.675591817323028
We hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge Italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that, from the point of view of biological implications, resources are, to some extent, sustainable.	3.9764134896669994
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	0.920242417336676
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	0.7687008441556769
Combating certain fish diseases	2.3729384365311934
The next item is the report A5-0036/2000 by Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93/53/EEC introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases (COM(1999) - C5-0168/1999 - 1999/0191 (CNS)).	3.5269382840799395
Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984, then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland.	6.813042605153213
Although the virus has been found in other species, the disease itself is so far confined to salmon.	6.060007852304208
The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures.	7.474775667860403
The Scottish salmon-farming industry is the biggest in the EU, spread throughout some of Europe' s most peripheral communities.	5.798220194247657
It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually.	6.482820897921948
It is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to Scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of Europe that the disease be brought under control and, if possible, eradicated.	4.228900466147191
The current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be slaughtered whether affected by the disease or not.	6.637673562725869
The intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible.	4.871316652682535
The reality is that the compulsory slaughter policy has failed even to contain, let alone eradicate ISA, and while failing to deliver its objectives, the present rule has had a devastating economic effect on the industry with no compensation being paid and no possibility of commercial insurance.	6.1622127566855
The proposed changes are twofold: the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle.	5.779886286183684
This is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at European level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine.	5.141353899677752
The second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms, working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm.	6.483006088565824
This approach has been used very effectively in Norway where new reports of ISA are down to a handful of cases a year having peaked at some 80-90 cases per year in the early 1990s.	6.879931108754717
I therefore support the Commission' s proposed changes and I am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation.	4.649121136839793
I also highlight the issue of compensation and call for the amendment of Council Decision 90/424/EEC by specifically including ISA in its appended list of diseases, thereby enabling compensation to be paid at 50% Commission, 50% Member State.	5.899579213013877
I thank colleagues in the Fisheries Committee for their overwhelming vote in support of my report and I in particular thank my Scottish colleagues in the committee for their input to this whole process.	5.811130682698036
I am opposing Amendments 7 to 13 which were decisively rejected by the Fisheries Committee.	6.34426476806434
Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text.	5.713193528328924
In particular, I have drawn attention to the need to study the extent and effect of interaction between farmed and wild salmon, the need to investigate the source of ISA and the need to test more widely for the virus in wild stocks.	5.040761869275173
These amendments by the Green component of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group are designed to provide justification for Amendment 13.	4.103135018876265
This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate as it seeks not only to retain the requirement for immediate compulsory slaughter of all fish but also to prevent any fish, whether diseased or not, from an affected farm from being sold and I must emphasise that under current policy no diseased fish are sold.	6.099295595812726
There is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold.	5.0236900528105775
Amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take account of the reality as evidenced by the starkly contrasting statistics from Scotland and from Norway.	5.380680693910664
In Scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective.	5.3510394170540145
In Norway, with their much longer experience, compulsory, 100% culling was abandoned some years ago and a range of measures have led there to a dramatically improved situation.	5.646568598392056
It is in all of our interests to ensure that in Scotland too we contain ISA and prevent its further spread.	5.588008774112439
Last week saw the publication in Scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on ISA.	5.765894396495726
This comprehensive document takes account of a wide range of possible risks and recommends action to combat them in areas such as site-to-site transmission, security measures to curtail escapes, treatment of waste and effluent, methods of detection and diagnosis, farrowing and rotation, disinfection of equipment and many, many more.	6.084410788145877
Some can and will be implemented immediately by local authorities using existing powers, others will be incorporated into codes of practice.	5.168533527611784
All will be beneficial, not just in relation to ISA but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required.	5.40376607401012
Your votes, colleagues, in favour of my report in full, as endorsed by the Fisheries Committee, will be a very important part of a wider ISA control package based on the reality of Scotland' s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others.	5.013527811526091
I congratulate Mr Hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable Members of Parliament to do likewise.	3.70679760631066
As he said, fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural Scotland and at a time when the rural areas of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years, the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend.	5.815901507076575
Now, as he said, in excess of 85 000 tons of Salmon is now produced in Scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than EUR 800 million annually.	5.789026103201103
Regrettably, although ISA was first detected in Scotland only two years ago, it has now spread to 29 farms directly and around 240 other farms are affected in some way or another.	6.113050395226449
Wild salmon, trout and eels have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment.	6.374599183547697
But I must say that despite the scare-mongering of the Greens, it has to be emphasised that ISA cannot under any circumstances be transmitted to humans, and I must repeat what Mr Hudghton said, that the virus cannot survive above 25o - which is human body temperature - it is a virus of a cold-water species.	5.661921803403813
It can, nevertheless, in the affected fish, lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole Scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around EUR 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures.	6.3491770692037335
So this report, Mr President, provides an encouraging range of proposals for improving the way in which the authorities in the UK and elsewhere should respond to the disease.	3.523198833291766
By recommending the introduction of a method of containment and gradual culling, similar to the system used successfully in Norway, the rapporteur seeks to introduce a more flexible approach to the disease which will provide confidence, not least to the insurance sector who have hitherto shied clear of providing any form of cover due to the insistence on a policy of compulsory slaughter.	5.4934974900638585
By recommending the research, development and ultimate use of vaccination to control and eradicate ISA, the rapporteur also provides comfort to the pharmaceutical industry who have hitherto had no incentive to invest in the development of a vaccine.	6.102663938843905
So I thoroughly recommend and hope that the Parliament will support this excellent report.	4.176450412940993
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hudghton, also for this report.	3.159547574156441
Scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the European Union and accommodates 90% of the British aquacultural industry.	5.104655762917929
The industry is located in some of Europe' s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities.	5.097500468683082
In recent research it is estimated that the industry is worth EUR 800 million per annum and 6 500 jobs rely on its existence.	5.9159893119722975
I believe that this report gives a clear method for dealing with Infectious Salmon Anaemia which is both practical, realistic and also achievable.	5.091142875290398
The example of Norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach.	3.160241936864196
As for the amendments, I oppose the amendments tabled by Mr Hudghton' s Green colleagues, that is numbers 7 to 13, not because I do not care about the risks to human health but because, according to scientific evidence, the virus does not survive beyond 25o Celsius and according to medical evidence, human beings at that temperature are dead.	5.349746548818558
There is a saying that the dead tell no tales and I am sure they do not eat fish but I do and I look forward to the implementation of this report.	4.505447967004224
I too would like to compliment Mr Hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development.	4.512489284374659
I too agree that Amendments 7 to 13 are unfortunate, indeed Amendment 13 would not merely negate the intended effects of the proposal but actually would make the situation even more difficult than under current rules.	6.373007812453023
This is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming.	4.804209864281638
Mr Hudghton has already referred to the final report of the UK joint government industry working group on ISA and the measures there are of relevance for fish farming wherever it happens, not just in farms affected by ISA.	6.110567993259469
Secondly, looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report later this evening, paragraph 28 is of particular importance.	3.3732842509769263
This calls on the Commission and Member States to step up the adoption of measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment.	3.7924102168140963
Thirdly, referring to the earlier discussion on the collection of fisheries data, I very much hope that the Commission will engage in projects and studies looking at aquaculture in the environmental context but I believe that is the way forward in relation to the environment, not the way that is suggested in Amendments 7 to 13, and I hope honourable Members will reject them.	4.832479306465672
Mr President, I do not agree with this chorus of satisfaction expressed by my colleagues, who are delighted about the relaxing of a directive that respects the principle of precaution and which takes measures to protect consumers' health.	4.94728502029189
This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon, causing death.	6.375815764205363
It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water, etc. Under the 1993 directive, not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected, exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution.	6.356446943795113
What we currently propose is to relax this directive, so that we do not cull all the fish, but only the fish that are found to be diseased.	4.852773737208869
For the others, well, we would have time to see what would happen, according to local circumstances.	3.40257558920904
I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way.	3.371431829200937
I would particularly draw my colleagues' attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of 27º has every advantage for the human race and that, consequently, there is no risk to men.	5.254873701554033
What about women?	2.2869836655478752
Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard.	6.397518681450529
There is also a risk to the environment, because we know that there is an incubation period in salmon and that, consequently, if they are eaten, they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk.	4.398578854915869
There is another risk to the environment as well, because this disease is transmitted to wild fish, as we have seen.	4.009123630996129
For this reason, together with my colleague, Patricia McKenna, we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the Commission.	2.8618346481765715
Mr Pietrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission' s proposal, in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish, but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy.	4.956776808546931
Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach, but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community.	5.143341137849233
This is a Community policy which will effect Ireland as well - where I am from - should similar unfortunate events occur.	5.893723687371823
There are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease, fallowing periods, restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others. Before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the Norwegians, we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster.	6.101242800777009
And people have spoken in the past about BSE.	4.07593499953159
For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed.	4.134834406025946
Had it been at that time, you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the EU a huge amount of money.	4.486997037582182
So it also has to do with environmental protection.	3.5147386939145746
The protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health.	2.646246209679062
I would like to thank Mr Hudghton for his excellent report on ISA and for broadly supporting the measures proposed by the Commission and also for the contributions from each of the speakers this evening.	3.698090167037316
The Commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms.	5.8726585401655536
However, this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating ISA.	4.561364536534572
Nor can it be done, if the proposal involves a threat to public health.	3.1324178237444613
The environmental implications must also be taken very seriously.	4.972335341023959
I am advised that ISA is considered non-pathogenic for humans and mammals.	6.94474380889624
The disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals.	5.555317918319688
The virus harms cold-blooded animals.	5.5937337479914095
It does not replicate at temperatures above 25º centigrade and would, if present in fish for human consumption, be inactivated when ingested.	6.816749888808692
In no way, however, can diseased fish be used for human consumption.	4.056210320182494
As an extra precaution, I am validating this advice to our scientific committee.	5.657594938453269
During the debate, a number of important issues linked to our disease-control strategy have been raised including compensation.	4.565981980904612
I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry.	6.024634156880956
You may know that with effect from 15 January 2000, under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance, Member States may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture.	5.331817122492021
The Commission' s services are drawing up implementing rules in order to ensure the practical application of this instrument.	4.161782382204713
Council Decision 90/424 constitutes another instrument for Community financial support in case of disease outbreaks.	6.271065725076216
I must emphasise, however, that there are serious constraints.	2.6545899526891117
Budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set.	4.893833037175835
So further thought is necessary.	4.280963058444557
I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90/424.	5.244461149221126
This is in particular the case for Amendments Nos 3 and 5.	3.8853316761605567
I agree, however, with the statement in Amendment No 2 saying that no compensation has been made payable to salmon farmers.	4.802281429786309
I am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance.	2.016311399553138
The Commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon.	5.8993764277744125
The intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations.	3.915037738055641
I believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in Amendment No 4.	4.915078948129997
Experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers.	6.218917867905733
Those could perpetuate an infection.	4.80515058532474
I therefore am not able to accept Amendment No 4.	3.239029374748229
You also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease.	3.544088787169471
I agree that such research is needed and I understand this is at present being organised in the United Kingdom.	5.623334818461913
I will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals.	5.381511725733021
It must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the Community must be organised.	4.785357417439407
In this context I am happy to partly accept Amendment No 1, taking into account, however, that scientific investigations are not done by the Commission but that the Commission relies on results of investigations carried out in the Member States.	4.350640963028863
I also can partly accept the part of Amendment No 6 saying that Directive 93/53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence.	5.339696722245792
As I pointed out earlier, the available scientific evidence is that ISA is not a threat to health.	5.000953809369164
I can therefore agree to Amendment No 10 with the proviso that the words, and I quote, "of the highest possible standard" are replaced by "are safe" .	4.75376904267335
With regard to the environmental impact, it is a well-known phenomenon that while stocks have fallen during the last decades several reasons have been advanced to explain these reductions: pollution, over-fishing, changes in climate, etc. It cannot at present be excluded that ISA has an impact on wild stock.	5.5058238575343035
Fish escapes from aquaculture premises have been reported in the past and the virus has been found in wild stocks.	5.867130962255344
In this context, a number of scientific questions that can only be resolved through further research remain open.	3.47716356811652
It is for that reason that a careful approach towards the control of ISA is needed.	5.313932650998044
Diseased fish should not remain in the farms and I am prepared to look into the matter so as to avoid unnecessary shedding of a virus into the environment.	5.429601067058897
For that purpose, I propose to amend our initial proposal to provide that rural programmes established by the competent authority must be approved by the Commission. This is to avoid excessive withdrawal periods.	4.682449712641824
I also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate.	5.617123800448261
The procedures for setting additional control measures that already exist in Community legislation will be used to establish withdrawal schemes based on the state of health of the fish in order to minimise a possible environmental impact.	5.736185626989682
Bearing this in mind, I can agree to accept Amendment Nos 7 and 8 with a minor change to the latter.	4.605274040422886
I am also very sympathetic towards Amendment No 9, but I believe that it can be better formulated so as to join, at the same time, environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies.	4.267011093567675
I do not feel in a position to accept Amendments Nos 12 and 13.	3.9804662510060482
It is my feeling that these amendments aim to achieve a zero risk.	4.7853610168166165
I believe this objective is very difficult to achieve without closing down the fish farming sector concerned.	4.4054574182839845
I look forward to Parliament' s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward.	4.452340516394078
I can partly accept Amendment No 11.	4.163777634283597
Finally, I would like to emphasise that we continue to strive to maintain a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations under the Treaty.	2.5590032688795152
I believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward.	4.72359595632588
We remain committed to eradicating the disease, an objective that will be beneficial for both the environment and the salmon-farming sector.	5.175159370660885
I hope that in accepting our proposal the European Parliament acknowledges our commitment and I would be very grateful for that.	4.7483749823147505
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.	1.4721377189162732
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	0.7687008441556769
Protection of juvenile marine organisms	2.7239750928930064
The next item is the report A5-0035/2000 by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 1626/94 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean and for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (COM(1999) 552 - C5-0040/2000 - 1999/0222(CNS)).	4.32463879257073
The proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one.	4.372018115345851
By now, my colleagues in the Fisheries Committee and indeed in the Parliament will be well aware of our commitment to technical conservation measures which are based on sound technical advice.	4.9634202969740695
The body charged with giving this advice based on sound scientific data is the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna.	4.5703130354384065
This intergovernmental fishery organisation of which the European Union is a member is responsible for the conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic and the adjacent seas including the Mediterranean.	5.9429630046833255
This body was established back in March 1969 and is formally obliged to meet biannually, however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice.	6.512821355380395
The body then makes recommendations with a view to maintaining stocks.	5.379263185142173
This body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics, finances and administration, compliance and conservation and management measures.	6.36316264606993
They have also four panels dealing with tropical tuna, with temperate tuna, the north and temperate tuna south and other species.	6.812083124266187
These panels are powered to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention.	6.309742372844428
Proposals made by the panels are then presented to the Commission and the Commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties.	4.918250636938616
These conditions are binding, however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six-month period.	5.800667243486721
The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law.	4.793317259346357
At a ICCAT meeting in November 1998 in Santiago de Compostela, changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna.	6.452432220486471
ICCAT also made recommendations in 1974, 1994 and 1996.	4.916980780942549
As of now, it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1.8 kilos.	5.707933584796669
At its recent meeting in November 1998, the ICCAT standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna populations.	6.138765765676895
The information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans.	6.352949418206598
It was agreed that the SCRS should present a study at the 1998 meeting. It was intended that this meeting be presented with various possible recovery options with a view to maximising sustainable yields by taking into account alternatives or possible levels of recruitment and mixing of stocks.	6.5775716608554236
It was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine, in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock.	6.517356795421621
Following all of the research, the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the Mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 August to 31 August.	6.971312175787454
It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations.	3.788259607364065
Bluefin tuna is the world' s most expensive fish fetching up to EUR 90 000 per ton at the auctions in Tokyo and, of course, the indication of the importance of the Mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons.	6.008640974089594
80 percent of it was landed by purse seine.	5.976075678127758
The Mediterranean is an important spawning area for bluefin tuna so therefore it is important that the necessary measures be taken to enhance the protection of juveniles.	5.26098903990841
The minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age.	5.102918375087948
The measures agreed in November 1998 are binding since 21 June, I repeat 21 June 1999, months before the communication was forwarded to the Parliament' s Fisheries Committee and 9 months almost to the date.	6.08647457244072
Now I believe, Commissioner, this is not good enough and that in the future we must learn and that reports must be submitted to the Parliament' s Fisheries Committee before decisions are taken, otherwise then we are nothing further than a rubber stamp and I know that is not the intention of the Commission or the Commissioner but let us learn from mistakes of the past.	4.873929168963767
Mr President, this proposal aims to incorporate into Community law an ICCAT recommendation from 1998 which should have been binding from June 1999, but which only reached this House at the end of last year.	4.95464928796192
The Commission' s legislative delay on certain issues should not surprise us, but for the fact that this is a recommendation from one of the most important international fisheries organisations on the protection of such a threatened resource as tuna.	4.237836535079929
The Mediterranean, particularly in some zones, is an extremely important spawning area for the bluefin tuna which is of enormous commercial value.	4.910299307404796
This is why ICCAT recommended this closed zone in the Adriatic and toughened the conditions for catching zero-age fish.	6.199056710073872
As rightly said by the rapporteur, both measures are totally and fully justified which is why we have no alternative but to ask for their approval.	4.982511927190893
However, I also agree with Mr Gallagher who felt bound to indicate his frustration at the tardiness of the Commission in getting into gear and transforming the recommendations into Community law.	6.485675503412805
We are, for example, still waiting for the proposal for a regulation on banning the import of bluefin tuna from Honduras and Belize. The recommendation for this dates from 1996.	4.709985388356913
Apparently, according to my information, the Fisheries Directorate-General sent a note last January to the Trade Directorate-General which is still on the preparatory work.	5.377376434594674
Four years to apply this ban on imports from countries known to favour flags of convenience is absolutely unacceptable.	5.631766485286866
We have listened to the Commission' s explanations about the long internal process involved in transposing legislation. This has simply left us with an image of an exasperating bureaucracy.	4.773408813046087
Yet I have my doubts about the only proposal currently on the table to improve this process which would involve doing away with the Council and Parliament procedure.	5.366539140041988
It is clear that we must find a solution to this problem, either at the time of the Commission report on regional fisheries organisations or, if possible, before then.	4.003427874640627
I do not suppose that anybody in this House would object to the principle of protecting juveniles of marine organisms.	5.6226996289220175
Indeed, it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources.	4.597966127588976
All laudable stuff.	2.3277396971099784
There can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance.	5.901554673578913
As a king sport fisherman myself, I would love to see the days of the 1930s come back when anglers from the port of Scarborough in Yorkshire caught bluefin tuna weighing up to 830 pounds.	6.051225535572645
I do not know what the metric equivalent is.	3.5236007299087873
So I support the findings of ICCAT and I support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues.	3.531104538882586
My concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst Rome burns.	5.229348963222967
The common fisheries policy is not working.	1.6888129339636215
For all of the high-minded talk about conservation, the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster.	3.8258346460147585
In mixed fisheries, you cannot discriminate.	4.722326699870957
The sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless.	5.950935673717022
From a UK perspective there is also a deep-seated political objection to the CFP.	5.139016606084836
Many people now feel if this is federalism you can keep it.	6.124105822204262
Let me illustrate this with a topical example.	3.9957025603284047
In February, Commission Regulation 394/2000 designed to protect Irish Sea cod stocks was issued.	6.220259754178156
It means that in Fleetwood, 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April.	5.459270724199502
The scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done.	5.060803293361661
However, more than a dozen large Belgian beam trawlers have been granted a derogation from this regulation so the vessels that caused the very problem in the first place are carrying on fishing whilst it is a criminal offence for the UK fleet to do so.	6.310785475586128
The CFP does not assist in conservation and is angering the British public to the point where we demand to re-establish control over our own territorial waters.	5.7509407989555195
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Gallagher' s report on the fourth amendment of the Regulation on technical measures was not amended in our committee. It was actually approved unanimously for which I congratulate the rapporteur.	4.440723232262217
This also shows that our committee is in total agreement when it comes to supporting measures which aim to protect species, such as tuna in this case.	4.882609392670975
These decisions must be defended by the Commission in ICCAT. This is why our committee asked to be consulted in advance and to be represented at the meetings as an observer in order to ensure greater and better control and to reinforce the European Parliament' s role.	5.689996731392028
Mr Fischler, I am delighted that the Commission responded favourably to our request in the last and constructive debate which we had on this issue and has asked to attend our next meeting this month to inform us about the future preparatory ICCAT meeting.	5.516764010316837
Our rapporteur' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded.	5.178353304463249
I must highlight the part of the report which states that, in 1975, with regard to the size of bluefin tuna, a minimum limit of 6.4 kg with a 15% tolerance in the number of fish was recommended for the entire Atlantic.	4.935819750413016
However, according to the SCRS study, the regulation establishing the 6.4 kg minimum has been poorly enforced in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean fisheries.	6.211201614274809
The WWF reports that, according to Italian, French and Spanish customs authorities, illegal bluefin fishing and landings of small fish are on the increase.	5.751354954007471
I cannot and do not want to go any further as we are pushed for time.	4.049756670072029
However, I must again congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher.	3.7524878036620053
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	0.920242417336676
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	0.7687008441556769
Fishing and the environment (Bergen 13-14 March 1997): 2nd report	5.661379866779379
The next item is the report (A5-0016/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the second report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of the "statement of conclusions from the intermediate ministerial meeting on the integration of fisheries and environmental issues, 13-14 March in Bergen" (COM(1999) 270 - C5-0156/1999 - 1999/2150 (COS)).	4.0468725582407545
Mr President, Mr Fischler, my report concerns the vital integration of environmental and fisheries issues, as discussed at the ministerial meeting in Bergen.	4.977002263244766
This integration has always been a priority for me as we would be doing the fisheries and fishermen of the future a disservice if we did not emphasise the need for conservation of resources and responsible fisheries in general.	5.383823645510462
To fail in this respect would mean food for today but hunger for tomorrow, not just for our fishermen and the people of Europe but, more seriously, for humanity as a whole.	5.894131532138242
The common fisheries policy is theoretically very demanding and very strict in this respect, perhaps more so than most people, both Europeans and non-Europeans, would believe.	4.490300882172935
I have therefore asked the European Commission to produce a publication which lists all the measures of the common fisheries policy aimed at conserving and protecting resources. This will serve to publicise our protectionist actions.	4.9506632167134805
We have also asked Parliament' s own DG IV to prepare a systematic study of these measures for the Committee on Fisheries.	5.079238582724967
The revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is the biggest time-limited challenge facing us. We must completely overhaul, modernise or, if you prefer, update this policy in its entirety.	5.08712350477975
I would stress that the whole of the CFP must be revised, particularly the part on the protection of fish stocks.	4.010775730424758
This is the basis of my request to the European Commission and the services of this House.	3.008948529371075
I do not believe that the state of stocks and the current scandalous system of discards are a good example of the policy' s effectiveness which must therefore, in my opinion, be significantly improved.	4.106425826581919
I do not want to and cannot go into too much detail, Mr President, given the time constraints and also the interpreters' fees.	4.146220818237151
However, I will just remind you that the meeting in Bergen showed very significantly that a proper policy on the sea must be created.	5.1030834356301344
The President-in-Office informed our committee that the current Portuguese presidency intended the CFP to be regarded as a policy for ensuring the sustainability of our resources. This must be our objective in Europe and throughout the world.	4.818937263108964
In this respect, important Community initiatives arose from Bergen which have always been supported by our committee. These are aimed at re-establishing the breeding biomass, reducing and adapting fishing effort to resources, protecting juveniles, species and their habitats and adopting technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fisheries.	5.925684333640884
These initiatives, together with effective systems of control, are the key aspects for the future of fisheries.	3.87166912981772
However, we do not have to resort to extreme solutions, as Mr Katiforis initially suggested in his draft report.	4.742673746127122
I am referring to this now because I will not have time to speak later on.	4.175163780541503
I must point out in this respect that it was the numerous amendments tabled and approved in our committee and the flexibility shown by Mr Katiforis which enabled his report to be approved by our committee.	4.700403165402902
Coincidence or fate has worked to bring together in this part-session both my report and Mr Katiforis' s report on fisheries and the environment. The oral question from our committee on the extremely serious consequences for fisheries of the accident involving the tanker Erika will also be considered tomorrow.	5.421615757421407
Maritime transport, industrial and urban pollution and waste also have negative effects on fisheries whose problems do not just come from overfishing.	5.447792073861271
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	0.920242417336676
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	0.7687008441556769
Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment	3.724220720658169
The next item is the report A5-0017/2000 by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament: Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment (COM(1999) 363 - C5-0176/1999 - 1999/2155 (COS)).	3.8142902758437565
The problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this House many times in the past.	4.478724263210279
This particular communication from the Commission forms part of the Commission' s overall strategy of improving the integration of environmental considerations into other Community policies.	4.443550316339508
The overall strategy of the Commission is to direct fisheries activities towards both economically and environmentally sustainable levels through management of the scarce resource in such a manner as to prevent its exhaustion through over-exploitation and/or environmental degradation.	6.6553784895736205
The alternative to successful management is the economic decline of the fisheries industry as stocks dwindle and demand for fish products is increasingly met by imports.	6.754723757471144
I understand I have been described in a Spanish newspaper as an enemy of the fishing industry because I have said such things.	5.415130307690121
Of course, I am only an enemy of the fishing industry as much as anybody who recommends to some people not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting.	5.853092403010096
This is an unwise policy.	3.8842384549183264
In particular, the communication calls for control of fisheries pressure to benefit commercial stocks and marine aqua systems, improved measures for nature conservation in the marine environment, in the graded management of coastal areas, improved training, information transparency and a greater contribution from scientific research to fisheries management.	6.103700360370836
All of the above priorities will be pursued equally at both the Community level and in the various international fora in which the Community participates.	5.809510097760432
They should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the Community negotiates.	4.456443937158529
Whilst the communication reveals the Commission' s worthy intentions in this field, it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made.	5.304406553707875
One can quote from the communication.	3.2686589399031982
Over-exploitation is so severe in Community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent.	6.7029049938156975
That appeared in the communication published last July.	4.734471883793096
Since then, the Fisheries Council meeting of 16 December decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches for certain species such as cod and anchovy which were in the region of 25 percent for cod and 43 percent for anchovy for the year 2000.	6.256895459090182
Furthermore, the Commission adopted an emergency regulation for a recovery plan for Irish Sea cod, effectively calling a halt to cod fishing in the Irish Sea between 14 February and 13 April due to the crisis in the species.	6.631864768775097
These are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to over-exploitation.	5.508885745604681
What can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities?	2.4110282264306835
The first consideration must be to recognise that Community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced.	4.648450601183107
Secondly, the principles of such Community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the Community is a party.	3.9363521976540707
Thirdly, the European Union should undertake to enhance its monitoring and prevention of extensive pollution prevalent in Community waters and which is harmful to marine life including fishery resources.	6.156235039452179
More controls would be placed to prevent oil spillages such as that of the Erika in the Bay of Biscay and also deliberate dumping of waste oils.	5.2361591766886395
Recognition should also be given to the pressures which the delicate marine aqua system faces from urbanisation of coastal areas.	6.1928301286611065
Such pressures are greatest in Europe.	5.2747173031165335
In this context one can also mention the problems of discards of unwanted catches, fishing gear which destroys the seabed and the destruction of natural habitats by over intensive aquacultures.	6.281378252892014
A quota management system such as that existing in New Zealand since 1986 is one possible alternative.	6.381750518661756
Under this system, and given the total allowable catch for a species, a market is created for individual quotas for fishing rights within a certain area which the rightholders can trade amongst themselves, fish themselves or lease the rights to other fishermen for a certain time.	6.491405226553074
The property right that has been created in such a system is the right to fish - not the fish themselves.	4.685698607566597
Such a market organisation can reap better long-term prospects for the fishing industry.	5.091735248031315
At present dear colleagues, we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea, nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system.	5.16950162983876
However, we should never blind ourselves to scientific research, we should never cease to gather information, we should never cease to explore improvements in existing systems and, if necessary, we should at least consider policy changes.	4.9881424147147255
The fishery sectors in Europe face serious problems and I am a great supporter of the fishery sector.	4.81685345567256
I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to find the information, the political will to provide genuine long-term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short-termism.	5.156786874554291
I recommend the report to the House.	3.3461453583050678
The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission' s communication and we are also pleased that the Fisheries Committee adopted all our amendments.	4.380220054385206
It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch.	6.416252086136664
We welcome the intention of the Commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the EU including the common fisheries policy.	3.860179074664237
After all, the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies.	4.549106623095024
But as has been pointed out, the adoption of a rigorous definition of the precautionary principle is crucial. This is because it is all very easy to pay lip service to the idea and then to continue with business as usual.	4.345289687239452
The UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard.	5.212047307428808
One aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control.	5.04824305121986
All the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected.	4.273273620092133
Control is a Member State competence and the Council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries.	5.337412126039748
This is a good step forward, but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee continually point out, much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all Member States.	4.809887029422813
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.	0.9249736913493024
Mr President, fishing is an extremely important economic activity which involves major investment. Most of its jobs are provided under fairly tough conditions throughout entire Community regions.	6.057353523030293
However, some people' s view of the fisheries sector can be extremely simplistic, ranging from mere folklore to the insult of regarding fishermen as insensitive pirates and predators.	5.453382314640012
I regret to say that this report, due to its link with the environment, seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular misconceptions.	3.7864147032224293
If Mr Katiforis' s report had been approved in its initial wording, none of the members of the Committee on Fisheries could have gone into any fishing region again without fear of being lynched.	5.228957332687886
The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious.	4.313384893060091
Yet it is very wide-ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport.	5.429599131168981
To blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong.	6.730247995046903
Our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which I tabled 14, many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which I thank him sincerely.	5.137470894833713
Just when we thought the discussions had ended, a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which I ask you to vote against unreservedly.	5.294553629264127
According to these, for example, the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea.	5.616600310443427
Others, like Amendment No 4, which request financing for biological closures, also demonstrate a lack of understanding of fisheries regulations by requesting measures which are already in force, although admittedly there is room for improvement in these.	5.366796312568877
I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee' s debate. These two areas are closely related and they suffer the effects of the same environmental attacks.	5.546224105562251
As I have said many times before, the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the Erika.	3.7032349476387627
Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report has the virtue of having brought life, debate and controversy to a communication in which the European Commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions, although recognising its inability to put these into practice.	4.946495508381475
Mr Katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which, in his opinion, could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea.	3.852871558336174
Yet I must say that I disagree with many of his proposals because I am with those who believe that it is not just resources which are important in the fisheries sector but also the human beings who have been carrying out this activity for centuries.	4.39733925643988
I agree with the rapporteur that the European fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated.	3.746715487454042
However, what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the Commission and the Member States to take decisions and apply the current regulations.	4.159253856252605
Maritime transport, employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment.	4.604646550240161
As for the Structural Funds, certain examples could be mentioned but I will leave this for another day.	4.94417839218114
The European Parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries.	2.9503853705701797
The Commission and Member States should be meticulous in respecting the TACs and the quotas fixed in accordance with objective scientific criteria. The same yardstick should be used for everyone.	5.727768628158099
As Mr Katiforis says, discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept.	4.368226522191306
Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back.	5.642136737122904
The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear.	6.32931296362308
This House has already indicated its opposition to driftnets and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the passiveness of the national and Community authorities.	5.620623998019552
We socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector.	4.501833158082295
It is therefore essential that the Commission launches an information campaign on the CFP with this message.	4.670683824291575
Without a common fisheries policy there can only be lack of control, damage to the environment and an unsustainable economic activity.	4.5517664612617725
Mr President, I very much appreciate this report by Mr Katiforis on fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment.	4.384674754025937
Let us not forget that fish are at the very basis of our food chain and that the first 'environmental' disaster, Minamata disease, occurred in 1958 in Japan owing to the fact that fish were polluted by mercury.	5.358265500988752
We should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity, but also from domestic activity.	5.529981972944113
I do not believe that ejecting emissions at sea, and particularly in a closed environment like the Mediterranean, when we want to clean up purification plants, is a good way to clean up water.	4.813109471700523
We should pay particular attention to telluric pollution, to development, to the urbanisation of coastal areas, etc. But we should also think about restoring the environment and, for example, solving the problems associated with caulerpa taxifolia, and the areas of posidonia that are disappearing and which must therefore be protected.	4.557205226172186
They say that if you want something done, it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea, the fishermen, must be very attentive.	4.407383298608325
It will certainly be necessary to reduce the amount of fish caught and the elimination of the surplus capacity between 30 and 40%, as proposed by the Commission, has been very greatly watered down by the Council, to between 5 and 10%.	4.066660005032945
It will also be necessary to undertake selective fishing and, together with my colleague, Nol Mamre, who is also a former Member of the European Parliament, we would request a moratorium on the use of deep-sea trawlers in Community waters in the Bay of Biscay, to the south of the 47th parallel north, because we have had enough of seeing dolphins being washed up and dying on our beaches, particularly at the moment.	4.976771057594775
So we must practise selective fishing.	4.359026988819196
Aquaculture should also be monitored.	3.165579518071908
Read Mr Katiforis' s report again, in which he says that in Scotland, for example, 17 000 salmon are infected by the disease that I just mentioned, and impact upon the environment.	5.135691785408584
Let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment.	4.839873520402903
The Council of Europe is coming before the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 22 March to speak about the research work that must be undertaken, particularly in the marine environment and, more precisely, the scientific and economic challenges of exploiting the oceans.	3.985057860490793
Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to come and take part in this discussion.	2.3128369747016113
Mr President, the Katiforis report has been amended according to the proposals, notably, of the Europe for a Union of Nations Group, which were adopted in the Committee on Fisheries and, in my opinion, this version is an improvement on the original.	3.8657348840132095
I would like to touch briefly on these amendments.	3.9374205514233735
With regard to the installation of satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems, we feel that it is important for them to be installed on as many vessels as possible, although small vessels should not be compelled to carry them, of course, as investment and running costs would be disproportionately high compared to the value of the catches they make, and also in view of the fact that, in any case, satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems are not suitable or efficient for coastal fishing vessels.	5.112742289629348
We welcome the report' s rejection of the idea originally put forward by the rapporteur of creating a taxation system, as this would be impossible to implement and enforce for all the Member States.	3.886425589053421
Moreover, with regard to the protection of coastal areas, which are the main breeding and spawning grounds for many species of fish, we hope for tighter controls, which, in our opinion, should be accompanied by penal sanctions for throwing unwanted catches back into the sea.	4.147999298924718
In effect, this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management.	5.117725765407936
More specifically, with regard to fisheries management in the Mediterranean, we are all aware that fishing in the Mediterranean is not governed by provisions on TACs.	3.837420726219814
And just as well, in my view.	2.1291627483173152
As you may be aware, in contrast with the cold Northern seas, the Mediterranean is a small, warm sea where there are very few, if any, schools of only one species of fish.	5.356154499907351
In our opinion, the possibility put forward in the explanatory statement of this report of setting TACs in the Mediterranean is therefore inappropriate.	4.91311547247613
Lastly, we would vote for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left.	2.6046410872390986
We do believe that it is extremely important to give financial support to conventional fishing and craft trades and to boost the income of fishermen during periods when moratoria on fishing are in force: in short, we must make it possible to carry on a major, responsible economic activity while still ensuring proper respect for the environment.	5.044013462830918
Mr President, first of all, I am pleased that the Katiforis report takes into consideration the multitude of factors responsible for the deterioration of the marine environment: pollution, unsupervised fishing, drilling platforms and pressure from the increasing use of coastal areas for urban development are potential sources of widescale damage to the environment in both coastal areas and offshore, and fishing is also a victim of this situation.	5.078885622599232
There is therefore a need for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment.	2.0520849366707963
The use of selective fishing gear which reduces incidental unwanted catches and limits the throwing of unwanted fish back into the sea is certainly essential, as is a reduction of the pressure from the fishing industry offshore, as well as in coastal waters.	6.0804569538318
A reduction in the fishing capacity and in pressure from the fishing industry on fish stocks is not necessarily compatible with maintaining an outdated fleet and would limit modernisation.	6.059897980086485
In addition to providing more appropriate conditions of safety and hygiene, the use of more modern vessels could also contribute to reducing certain major factors.	5.35426768038254
Moreover, it is important to uphold the concept that it is not possible to make a surface categorisation of entire fishing sections as more environmentally friendly: in reality, in some cases, small-scale fishing has less of an impact on the environment and natural resources.	4.533411545618165
I am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources, and I also welcome the Commission' s request to propose the institution of a European award to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour, in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life.	4.846171349511274
Mr President, as a member of the Verts/ALE Group, but also as a Member of this Parliament for Galicia, I propose to use this intervention to enlarge upon two issues. I shall, of course, be brief.	3.2415616085570425
Firstly, fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin.	4.344176574319002
Shipowners and fishermen from the countries most active in fishing are more concerned than anyone about respecting their means of living, for without it, the future of this sector cannot be guaranteed.	5.443567980859125
Secondly, it is true that a policy of preserving the marine environment must be practised both in Community seas and in international waters or those belonging to third countries.	5.053731607367069
This particularly applies, however, to our own coastal waters.	3.728155852122864
Given this context, I would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago.	3.2354730494217017
I discovered that the EU is using ERDF resources to finance the construction of a wharf in Vilagarcia, in Galicia, for storing chemical and hydrocarbon products, on a site which will only employ three workers. This contravenes the EC environmental impact directive in relation to an estuary such as Arousa, where 26 000 people earn a living from the seafood industry.	6.641828635504748
Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.	2.350969727026427
Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it.	5.24558691279313
A lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep.	4.156034868760737
It is all very well to talk about conservation and I agree with it totally.	3.228917269265749
But at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where, when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the European Union.	4.909842639837614
Commissioner Fischler, of course, knows me from a long time back and I have written to him on BSE and many other issues in agriculture but now that he is responsible for fisheries I am going to have to berate him on fisheries, along with his lusty colleagues, because one of the areas that has been most affected has been my region and the fishermen of Northern Ireland.	4.61011141780026
In actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense, without any real negotiation or discussion.	5.728229561470639
It has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period.	5.544091396879071
Now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks, but what I am really saying to you Commissioner, and I have said this to you in the Fisheries Committee and I will say it to you again: There is a wide divide between Brussels and the working fishermen.	5.3465177966056805
It does not matter whether you come from Galicia, it does not matter whether you are from Northern Ireland or whether you are from Scotland.	4.379858311038929
That chasm exists and we in Brussels have not been able to cross that divide.	4.924428196847195
And we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen.	2.0617539076671227
We have got to take on board the concerns of the fishermen and we have got to work closely with them and I hope that you, as the Commissioner responsible for fisheries, will recognise that divide and will try and work as closely as you possibly can to ensure that all sides are brought together and their views are taken on board.	4.3339447643122
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	0.920242417336676
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	0.7687008441556769
Bankruptcy procedures	-0.0
The next item is the report A5-0039/2000 by Mr Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Finland, with a view to the adoption of a Council regulation on insolvency proceedings (9178/1999 - C5-0069/1999 - 1999/0806(CNS)).	3.134636571480101
Mr President, I think we all agree that a European legal area must be created.	3.3286868462365717
We also all agree that there should be harmonisation in a field that is marked by the great disparity of our legal systems and, what is more, concepts.	4.174052439673446
The very word bankruptcy, the legal concept of bankruptcy, does not cover the same accounting concept in each of the Member States of the Union.	5.009941907889501
We therefore all agree on the established facts, and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction.	3.843610549577596
If I may, however, just make a few comments on the method.	2.608343127032975
When you observe - and you cannot fail to do so - the disparity in the legal systems and concepts, and the fact that we wish to improve coordination, I believe that there are three ways in which we can proceed.	4.393266098715033
The first is to establish equivalence, saying: in the final analysis, bankruptcy in France is the same thing as bankruptcy in England or in Germany.	5.3489620569513505
The second way is to recreate a law ex nihilo, that is to say, to harmonise the systems and completely overhaul all the concepts and legal systems in each of the Member States.	4.98702703074463
That is not the route that has been taken.	3.424508715442844
The third route that has been taken is in the end to superimpose above the existing systems, which are not touched, a real embryo of Community law of collective procedures and procedures for companies in difficulty.	5.4997667624113715
This is a good thing, moreover, and the result has probably exceeded what the authors had hoped for.	4.466971160825577
But at this stage I should like to make an observation, which is not technical, but more philosophical and taken from practice.	5.083512527619977
It is that bankruptcy is experienced within the European Union, in the majority of States, as an absolutely definitive event for the person it affects.	5.09399955378241
And I believe that it is our responsibility, in an ever more rapidly moving economy, where everyone must have a real opportunity, to give people the chance of running a commercial enterprise, and a second and a third chance, if necessary.	5.202720812950304
Today, in many Member States, that is not possible.	2.263698397461479
One of the reasons that explains the difference in competitiveness between the European area, for example and the United States, is precisely this ability of bouncing back that exists on the other side of the Atlantic and that we just do not have here.	5.512851053666434
I believe that since we have gone that far and we are continuing along that path, which is the route of creating a collective procedure for regulating this type of legal standard in the European Union, we should bear in mind that it should not become the allegorical figure of the guillotine.	5.0011915317385895
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe, in fact, that it is more by luck than skill that there have not so far been any disasters due to the absence of the rules mentioned by the previous speakers.	4.260440100551273
When we deal with the positive side of the single market and create a common internal market, we must also deal with the darker side, namely bankruptcies.	2.6755855129472863
I consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard.	3.298613613350474
I congratulate the rapporteur for having so quickly progressed further with his report.	4.817843091712904
I am, moreover, proud that my own country has been involved in tabling this regulation which we now hope will swiftly be adopted by the Council.	4.388755432574614
I think it is an important step we are taking, even if each of the national systems is not especially influenced by it.	4.9166821491089685
To the rapporteur' s regret, I must unfortunately point out that our Group cannot support Amendment No 3 because we consider that it restricts creditors' legal position and impairs their legal protection.	5.359996317381308
With regard to Amendment No 6, we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee. I am a little surprised that you in the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not support it then.	4.177081786948349
We shall now support your Amendment No 6, but I wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee.	5.448690650679541
I also hope that we produce some insight in this context and that we shall be able to compare which procedures are quickest and best in the various countries.	5.310676743655309
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the Commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this evening is merely an amendment of the 1995 Convention on insolvency proceedings.	3.594980360666329
As you all know, this convention was the result of many years of discussion, which was often difficult and often laborious, and that for this very reason, it represents a compromise between unitary and territorial principles, that is to say, the structural principles of the different legal insolvency proceedings in each of our Member States.	4.767673611919523
Because we are aware that the developing global economic situation, and particularly the single market, can force businesses to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings, which often take the form of cross-border proceedings, the Union itself is fully justified in equipping itself with the binding legal instruments it needs to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structural principles, thus ensuring that they are carried out swiftly.	5.0018319163750276
For better or for worse, the fact that businesses become insolvent will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life.	5.324891519178087
It will furthermore be a factor in renewing the very fabric of business, which must not be hindered by the existence of slow bureaucratic procedures or by obstacles that prolong the agony of businesses that are no longer viable.	6.130991534830327
This is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy.	3.865966889159398
It was not the Commission that presented the present proposal for a regulation but two Member States, Germany and Finland, by means of a joint initiative under the right of initiative which Member States share with the Commission on such issues.	4.370633933942
The Commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the Convention.	3.9016022253855596
As far back as 1981, the Commission had already stated its position in favour of clearly adopting the principle of unitary insolvency proceedings.	5.841142822163882
Furthermore, this view was accepted in the Commission' s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses.	4.584908836203372
The 1995 Convention, on the other hand, authorises the filing of secondary proceedings, thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the Commission would like to see accepted.	4.831898140591424
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted, one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings.	4.206300972240286
Nevertheless, I do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the 1995 Convention which was, moreover, based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years.	4.399856000328503
Consequently, the Commission has refrained from presenting an amendment. Instead, it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues.	5.514550308581874
The Commission feels, for this reason too, that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation, but I would nevertheless like to convey to you the Commission' s opinions on the amendments under discussion.	4.814239347758949
The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner.	3.803011247243676
On the other hand, it does not accept Amendment No 4.	1.5874338617940913
Indeed, the Commission feels that Parliament should instead support Amendment No 4 by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which would allow the annexes to the regulation to be modified by the Commission, assisted by a regulatory committee, in accordance with the on-going procedure of Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC.	3.6985147115694037
Therefore, with regard to the amendments proposed by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 3 and 4. On the other hand, it does not accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2, on the idea of "centre of the debtor' s main interests" .	2.9114033839592994
With regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person, this idea is clearly defined in Article 3.	5.1256268941328775
In all other cases that have not been specifically addressed, we feel that the reference made in Recital 13 should be sufficient.	4.822064210495738
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.	2.0657367308909027
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	0.7687008441556769
(The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m.)	2.8697854788276262
Shipwreck of the Erika	2.3512213017914965
The next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Commission, on the shipwreck of the Erika.	3.2164640555071307
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today.	2.922627004370794
Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments.	5.157761927053308
He must have reconsidered and, in so doing, has, as usual, shown great respect for this House. I thank him for this.	3.7766698385582522
On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker Erika.	3.490826131797175
There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue.	5.4275534987988845
Firstly, we must show the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident.	3.8752737441297107
Secondly, we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster, namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions.	5.919700013212967
The epilogue to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future.	5.181688871159116
Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event.	5.436388476310866
We must now get down to adopting measures, Commissioner.	3.9316670673308387
Firstly, efficient controls are needed in Community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport, particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved.	5.948761492159246
The construction of these vessels, the use of double hulls, their age, their control by classification companies, insurance, the creation of databases containing all relevant information, Community cooperation and coordination, the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled. Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for European harmonisation in these areas?	5.650340319025335
Flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport, particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling 'responsible fisheries' .	5.946803444107447
Access into Community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards must be controlled.	2.919459747644412
We expect concrete action from the European Commission. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of Brittany and the Vendée are particularly important, well-developed and prestigious.	4.779317043913826
The European Commission must therefore publicise the damage caused and its assessment of this damage. It must also indicate all the specific measures, including political, economic, social and financial measures, which it intends to adopt in order to minimise the damage and compensate the fishermen and industries which have been dramatically affected overnight.	5.5613969320464465
How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained?	4.830512338605256
How can those affected be compensated?	4.540860717521059
This is a very serious problem which the European Union, as an economic, commercial, industrial and fishing power, must tackle.	3.164771483343782
We must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and occupations.	5.643145119370397
We must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future.	5.05285424897922
This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries.	2.7070692252538757
We hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission, with plenty of action and no more regrets.	4.286910047433105
This House will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups.	4.879567350880112
Mr President, the shipwreck of the Erika off the coast of Brittany on 12 December caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years.	5.443907786702302
In addition to destroying natural resources, this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors, particularly those dependent on fisheries.	5.039102562889745
With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel, the situation could still deteriorate.	5.47685420714079
The consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming ashore. These consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself.	6.518895561062193
The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance. They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which, unfortunately, is not an isolated event.	5.110424281085679
The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature, which is nowadays too often being punished by man' s activities.	6.043630895953671
These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities.	4.865372776441607
Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes.	3.631543036812435
Surely the budget would agree, as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these.	5.742251160065662
Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked.	4.969438855574053
Yet on the issue of the Erika he has given the impression, perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vendée, that, as the Fisheries Commissioner, he is not always available or, at best, available only on a part-time basis.	4.523146537997096
As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January, the needs of the severely affected fisheries, ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account.	5.383533759094874
We therefore now call upon the Commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds.	4.699794853978098
Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks.	5.994580446496338
We cannot understand how it is that experiences like the Urquiola or Amoco Cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience.	5.875481658869323
Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this.	5.550840421344409
We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen.	6.769475563977686
The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate.	2.647619489037357
It is time that polluters started to pay because, up to now, it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid, and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well.	4.779421585111025
I am therefore delighted at Mr Fischler' s response, particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted.	5.109999441850111
On behalf of the PSE Group, I want to send a message of solidarity to those affected, to the fishermen, farmers and businesspeople who enable the products of the sea to be regularly brought to market.	3.8043983438181197
My message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians, to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support.	4.382432713741088
I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner.	3.579816098719058
Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable.	4.429023156214735
The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people.	5.650326080334688
The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission' s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly.	3.726402500168177
It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified, where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two.	5.982279382780644
The Erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address.	5.525146379144921
This question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future.	4.933842474640249
The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern, and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this, is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of Erika in future. Will it really address the concern or will, in practice, in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas, the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause.	5.120940032066954
Mr President, our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster, but good intentions are not enough, there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment.	4.891200312355067
We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation, and for this to be backdated.	4.040001530826924
We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection, and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority, and also, in particular, of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory.	4.229037195556598
We further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats.	5.009777209935026
Finally, we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic, with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million.	5.906174985866366
This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products.	5.725263435288954
This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment.	5.5452092031937
Finally, we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks, as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage.	4.288461357212963
A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation.	4.488686105769165
Solutions cannot be found at the last minute, when the disaster is already in progress.	4.56754912898484
Consequently, the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand.	4.744577645116008
Mr President, over two months after the wreck of the Erika, pollution of the coasts, which have already been cleaned once, is still continuing.	4.152310062492498
While reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this, I should like to salute the dedication of the workers, professionals and volunteers, who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches.	5.081510750118516
Thanks to the grass-roots involvement, which this House furthered by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 January, an initial raft of measures has been announced.	5.555658621266148
The French Government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety, particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection.	4.843872779655237
The lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full, and decisions must be taken speedily at Community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or berthing in our ports, to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants, and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection.	5.978924874699091
We must also demand that the parties truly responsible be made to pay the costs incurred due to the pollution.	5.299628774729863
So, yes, Total Fina must provide the financial resources to contribute to the repair of ecological, economic and social damage and to compensate the people affected by the disaster.	4.713106077625925
The French State has released funds for compensating damage.	5.899137945662767
I feel, however, that the European Union has so far not actually come up with any expression of Community solidarity at the requisite level.	4.326863471880204
So, yes, appropriations must be released at Community level to support the cleaning of the contaminated coastlines, to assist the organisations which went into action to save oil-covered birds, and to contribute towards getting the affected businesses back on their feet.	5.656178693040138
Specific compensation should be provided for the fishermen and shellfish farmers who have suffered considerable loss of income and who face having to invest considerable sums in order to repair everything and regain consumer confidence.	6.415567369822734
I was pleased to hear the statement which Commissioner Fischler has just made, and I take careful note of the commitments he made before this House.	5.034871374800144
I should also like to say that my Group shall remain vigilant and committed, in collaboration with the grass-roots action groups, to ensuring that the parties affected receive compensation as soon as possible and that legislation is strengthened at every level, supported by realistic penalties in the event of non-compliance.	4.595807962390891
Mr President, the reason why it is important to return to the subject of the oil slick, two and a half months after the wreck of the Erika, is because the extent of the economic, social and ecological disaster affecting our Atlantic coastline is, in fact, far greater than the first assessments gave us to understand.	3.878263574177592
Cakes of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the Atlantic coastline on a daily basis.	6.377022908023899
Curiously, the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified.	5.660804781134776
The ecological disaster is a major one, possibly unprecedented in scale.	3.5867729802484933
Large-scale degassing proliferates and the 16 000 tonnes of tar remaining in the wreck at a depth of 120 m present a major risk of fresh pollution.	6.223401235685306
All workers in the fishing, fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard.	5.164739752391897
The chief victims today are the shellfish farmers who were once the most successful producers in Europe.	6.011253949754652
The frontline victims are the producers or freight forwarders banned in the Vendée and Loire-Atlantique regions.	6.4859765695725455
Some of them have already lost several years' worth of harvests, but the 50% to 80% slump in sales is affecting all the harbours on the Atlantic coastline, and even those in the Channel and North Sea.	5.98178243997867
As regards fishing proper, passive gear fishing is currently the hardest hit.	5.918338497031749
After shellfish, the slump is now affecting crustacean sales.	6.276447301044811
The many fishing days lost affect the entire industry and, above all, the future of fishery products, an area in which prices had seen something of a turnaround in very recent years, now hangs entirely on consumer reaction and we are starting to see signs, unfortunately, of initial disenchantment.	5.457504196692261
