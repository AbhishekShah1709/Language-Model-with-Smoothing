For one thing, it can be assumed that a moderate amount of movement does not increase the risk of developing arthritis: for another, sporting activity during early and late childhood produces a high maximum bone mass, therby delaying the development of osteoporosis in later life.	1.0104888672941348
The new guidelines on the extent and intensity of health-giving exercise make it easier to advocate exercise and sport for disease prevention and health promotion because they appear to implement.	0.949597665864963
More difficult, however, is deciding on a suitable method for motivating inactive individuals to increase their level of physical acitivity.	1.0226170070568834
A model that has proved effective in smoking cessation programmes, and one that can also be applied to exercise counselling (transtheoretical model), can help in the selection of an appropriate counselling strategy.	1.2605623470134277
Depending on whether an individual is inactive, or sporadically or regularly active, each one employs his or her own strategies primarily to maintain this lifestyle.	0.97888419243525
Assuming that the counselling is adapted to the level of activity, the patient's attitude and behaviour can be influenced both more effectively and more economically.	1.1143562553398505
Background: Photorefraktive keratectomy (PRK) is the most frequent refractive surgical procedure worldwide.	1.2995747296310758
The central corneal thickness is reduced due to removal of the anterior stroma, including Bowman's layer, with a laser beam.	1.2046640645522482
This procedure results in considerable alterations of the corneal structure.	0.7587582044530262
What does this mean for the mechanical properties of the cornea?	0.8460104299738668
Beginning in the 1920s Wilhelm Reich developed the fundamental concepts of a body-oriented psychotherapy out of psychoanalysis.	0.8456558659253766
He started from considerations of egopathology, sexuality and the analysis of resistance and character patterns.	0.8326576543822445
Characterological and bodily attitudes were understood as defence-patterns against emotions, which function not only psychologically but also bodily.	0.9160776184812256
Thus he began to mobilize repressed affects through working on muscular tensions and bodily expressions.	0.6916830721390814
That way their meaning in the person's history could be understood and a self-healing process restarted.	0.932988444007926
This approach to release constrained energy is still valid for neoreichian schools such as bioenergetics, biodynamics, biosynthesis and others whose understanding of human nature and of healing processes is similar to those of other schools of humanistic psychotherapy.	0.9433487386883119
Bodily processes are used as indicators for the processes and successes of therapies.	0.9228766206913157
Besides there are impulses in modern body psychotherapies to work with the body in the relationship and transference process and attempts to reintegrate psychoanalytical concepts.	0.9794130395005738
Recurrent phlebothromboses in young patients with subsequent severe postthrombotic syndrome and chronic venous leg ulcers may be caused by underlying hereditary disorders of hemostasis or may occur as part of other congenital syndromes.	0.9020255083574126
The most common hereditary disorders of hemostasis in this respect appear to be deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S, and activated protein C resistance (mutations of factor V).	1.0978954344572214
Less frequently, dysfibrinogenemia, increased plasminogen activator inhibitor levels, or deficiencies of tissue plasminogen activator or heparin cofactor II may be found.	0.9854930907237279
Klinefelter's syndrome and homocystinuria are prime examples of those rare congenital disorders indirectly associated with an elevated risk of thrombosis in young individuals.	1.0055897185746627
Early diagnosis of these disorders will allow timely treatment, preventive care and counselling of patients as well as family members.	1.0831494588074917
Epidurography with contrast medium is used to verify the correct poition of an epidural catheter and to detect malpositioning.	0.99129901321987
There is great variability in the distribution of contrast medium according to the individual morphology of the epidural space and the way it is injected.	1.0493112569850114
Results of investigations of the anatomy of the spinal canal and epidural space performed with anatomic specimens, epiduroscopy, and conventional and computed tomographic (CT) epidurography are sometimes contradictory.	0.9715082506389271
We have performed CT epidurography in approximately 30 patients to date.	0.9048669659416904
Insights regarding the distribution of contrast medium in the epidural space can help to interpret conventional epidurographies and to explain special features, such as the "rail-road-track phenomenon" or the plica mediana dorsalis.	1.0969420204593308
Patients scheduled for major abdominal operations were studied.	0.7057635905286717
Catheters were introduced into the thoracic epidural space on the day before the operation.	0.7657773758181522
Conventional epidurographies were performed routinely after insertion of the catheters with a mobile X-ray apparatus, usually in the recovery room, using 5 ml iopamidol (Solutrast 250 M).	1.077393463420912
Selected patients (good mental state and stable psychic condition), after written consent and with approval of the local ethical committee, were investigated with CT epidurography using the same contrast medium (partly diluted).	1.232656851387813
From among the CT scans performed until now, five characteristic images are presented and compared to conventional epidurographies.	1.1783837311422172
When small volumes (5 mL) of iopamidol were injected slowly, we regularly observed a railroad-track phenomenon in the AP images of conventional epidurographies.	1.1738867374083535
After rapid injection of larger volumes (10 - 15 ml), the spread was more homogeneous and sometimes outline a lighter zone of contrast distribution in the midline.	1.1329850939410422
CT epidurography in these cases (5 out of 30 patients) revealed a plica mediana dorsalis.	1.2114147281761753
In the majority of the CT scans of the thoracic epidural space its anterior (ventral) compartment was unfilled by contrast medium.	1.090389921579925
According to the findings of several investigators, dura mater and ligamentum longitudinale posterius have grown together, so that an epidural space does not exist in ventral thoracic segments of the spinal canal.	1.0065374408413097
In lower thoracic and lumbar segments both structures are separate, and a wide anterior epidural space was present and filled with contrast medium.	1.1459359721359763
In other cases the dorsal and dorsolateral epidural space was completely filled, but the contrast medium stopped behind the spinal nerves and surrounding dural sheaths, as if these structures, together with the connective tissue strands between them, formed a membrane that spread in a frontal plane.	1.081967367153163
A railroad-track phenomenon is interpreted in the literature as the X-ray correlate of contrast medium spread in the subdural space, indicating an incorrect catheter position.	1.058365540774059
According to conventional epidurographies and confirmed by CT scans, this feature is also seen regulary in cases with correct catheter position.	1.1181747373171491
Small volumes of iopamidol spread preferentially into the wider parts of the epidural space between the gaps of the vertebral arcs, whereas the dura mater and periosteal layers touch at the inner side of the pedicules and laminae, allowing the existence of only a potential epidural space.	1.0662107475351914
This rhythmic widening and narrowing of the epidural space is the explanation of the "railroad track" in AP contrast epidurographies.	0.908777791824283
CT epidurography is a valuable tool to provide better insight into the morphology of the epidural space when filled with fluid (contrast medium, local anaesthetics), complementing findings using epiduroscopy and anatomic specimens.	1.022011780964596
It stands to reason that this time- and cost-expensive method can never replace conventional epidurographies, but can help to interpret them properly.	1.1792329681753297
A 71-year-old woman suffered from pronounced erosion of her nose after soft X-ray therapy (total dose 28 Gy, half dose depth 10.5-11.5 mm).	1.1154502167805225
5 weeks after the end of the irradiation no healing tendency was observed.	0.8765693506451695
This unusual clinical course was caused by a simultaneously existing pemphigus vulgaris that worsened after radiotherapy, presumably as a consequence of the release of epidermal antigens.	0.9371967180650611
In this case it is improbable that the pemphigus was induced by the radiotherapy, as has been reported on several occasions in the literature.	1.1430137791987693
However, this possibility cannot be entirely excluded.	1.122046488965038
A vascular etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been long debated.	0.8825986488480502
In order to search for an ischemic basis of PD we assessed the clinical symptomatology of a consecutive group of 60 PD patients and compaired their frequency of cerebrovascular risk factors, carotid atherosclerosis and ischemic brain lesions with age-matched groups of stroke patients and normals.	1.017406455931877
There were 16 (27%) subjects with PD who also had symptoms of cerebrovascular disease.	1.0872588921916333
The frequencies of carotid stenoses, ischemic brain lesions and most of cerebrovascular risk factors seen in the latter group was comparable with those of stroke patients and significantly higher than in the investigational subsets of patients with "pure" PD and normals.	1.0559941986309684
Only one (1.6%) individual with PD presented signs suggestive of an ischemic etiology of parkinsonism.	1.2222810647223434
These findings suggest that cerebrovascular disease occurs in approximately one fourth of patients with PD, but seldomly is causally related.	0.9679072993815596
Neurological involvement is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sarcoidosis.	1.022951856873673
The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of patients with neurosarcoidosis.	0.910186004902243
The MRI brain scans of 22 patients with sarcoidosis were retrospectively reviewed, along with the clinical information provided in the request form.	0.9707656321005751
All patients had signs and symptoms referable to the head and were examined with gadolinium enhancement.	1.2062813374565726
Cranial (facial) nerve paralysis was the most common clinical manifestation identified in 10 patients.	1.2241666523827615
A wide spectrum of MR findings was noted: periventricular and white matter lesions on T2 W spin echo images, mimicking multiple sclerosis (46%); multiple supratentorial and infratentorial brain lesions, mimicking metastases (36%); solitary intraaxial mass, mimicking high-grade astrocytoma (9%); solitary extraaxial mass, mimicking meningioma (5%); leptomeningeal enhancement (36%).	1.0944029344534236
The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis is often difficult, particularly so in patients who lack either pulmonary or systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis.	1.1002806401187364
MRI shows a wide spectrum of brain abnormalities associated with neurosarcoidosis.	0.8214856157118399
These findings, however, are not specific for sarcoidosis and one must consider appropriate clinical circumstances in arriving at the correct diagnosis.	1.0881560447491088
In selected cases with isolated brain involvement, meningeal or cerebral biopsy may be required.	0.8346727926069812
In 1990, we first described the papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome (PPGSS).	0.7051225097390494
It is characterized by an itching erythema and edema of the hands and feet together with oral mucosal lesions and fever.	0.7920659959657322
The skin  lesions subsequently become purpuric and resolve spontaneously after a few days.	0.746246087415941
In more than half of the patients, an acute parvovirus B 19 infection has been proven.	0.9478766680888436
In a few cases of PPGSS, other viral infections have been found, for example hepatitis B and measles.	1.2569668085062957
We report on a patient with PPGSS and review the literature.	0.8982324164666392
Fungus-bezoars in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of severe Candida albicans infection.	0.8416818990629009
A newborn infant with VACTERL-association suffered from fungus balls in the renal pelvis after Candida albicans sepsis, and developed a hydronephrosis with beginning postrenal failure.	0.8649964805438597
Following systemic antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosin as well as local irrigation with amphotericin B via percutaneous nephrostomy renal function normalised rapidly.	0.8205366501987104
Discussion: Since the incidence of systemic mycotic infection in neonates becomes more common the differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis should include fungus balls.	1.1033358877480184
Interactional understanding in psychoanalysis, especially the concept of the 'third point', suggests that the development of insight, empathy and relationship are dimensions of one and the same triangulating process peculiar to psychoanalytic understanding.	1.091949594479657
In this context the psychoanalytic method, here understood as working with resistance, transference and countertransference, does not only offer a route to cognition, but also to the formation of a conflict-solving, egostrengthening, and supportive relationship peculiar to psychoanalysis.	1.0915275672353832
The formula 'interpretation on the basis of countertransference' describes a form of psychoanalytic interpretation that takes up this context intentionally and can thus also be used for crisis intervention in the case of neurotic conflicts.	1.0611421473851856
This is exemplified by a case history.	0.8667854209489587
The Dutch Supreme Court ruled that in exceptional instances, physician-assisted suicide might be justifiable for patients with unbearable mental suffering but no physical illness.	0.8373205401782378
A recent report shows that explicit requests for physician-assisted suicide are not uncommon in psychiatric practice in the Netherlands.	0.9546050511753946
Some of those requests were granted and their medical background was described.	0.7829489960544005
Psychiatric consultation for medical patients who request physician-assisted suicide is relatively rare.	0.8824226510183137
Pemphigus is a rare intraepidermal autoimmune bullous disease.	0.8781431841728146
Two major variants, pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF), are distinguished.	1.142069224553978
The aim of this study was to document the clinical and immunpathological findings in all pemphigus patients who were diagnosed in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Würzburg over the past 10 years.	1.1339950721696481
Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a significant complication of spinal anaesthesia.	1.1416335334160468
Diameter and tip of the needle as well as the patient's age have been proven to be important determinants.	1.277473501843836
The question of whether post-operative recumbency can reduce the risk of PDPH has not been answered uniformly.	0.9885307982711534
And besides, some studies referring to this subject reveal methodical failures, for example, as to clear definition and exact documentation of post-operative immobilization.	1.0840102963331413
Furthermore, fine-gauge needles (26G or more) have not been investigated yet.	1.1281401394249593
The first aim of our study was therefore to examine the role of recumbency in the prevention of PDPH under controlled conditions using thin needles.	0.9916906941371612
Secondly, we wanted to confirm the reported prophylactic effect of needles with a modified, atraumatic tip (Whitacre and Atraucan) by comparing them to Quincke needles of identical diameter.	1.050721845799092
Most of the former investigators compared Quincke with atraumatic needles of different size regardless of the known influence of the diameter on PDPH.	1.0600763165369302
Three characteristic developments in modern western societies usually are considered to be independent variables in the ethical discussion:...	1.002171167028599
Background: Neuropathic pain syndromes may be treated by intervention at the sympathetic nervous system.	1.2072182106397773
The pain in these syndromes is therefore called sympathetically maintained pain (SMP).	0.7419348889989505
Typical disorders with a SMP component are complex regional pain syndromes (reflex sympathetic dystrophy and causalgia), traumatic neuralgias and herpes zoster.	1.058685016077027
The tendency towards sphincter-preserving resection for distal rectal cancers has led to a revival of the technique of coloanal anastomosis (CAA) in recent years.	0.9406272170814564
In order to improve functional results, creation of a colonic J-pouch in conjunction with a coloanal anastomosis (CPA) was proposed.	0.9490858041621169
Two different operation techniques exist: i) Double-stapling with the anastomosis close to the dentate line and ii) intersphincteric resection with the anastomosis located immediately at the dentate line.	1.0760644483894042
A long rectal remnant after double-stapling leads to urgency in 15 % of the patients due to stool retention in the atonic remnant.	0.9408503844129691
No propulsive motility patterns were recorded from the pouch which is emptyed passively by upper colonic peristalsis.	0.7918213168095645
Therefore colonic pouches should be fashionned of descending colon and should not exceed a length of 6 cm in order to prevent stool fragmentation.	1.052285337247796
Under these conditions the average stool frequency is reduced from 2-6 /d after CAA to 1-3 /d after CPA.	1.1615460111837803
This effect is maximal during the first postoperative months, but is still significant after 3 years.	1.332910272740876
Colonic pouch construction also leads, due to better blood supply and prevention of pelvic hematomas, to a significant decrease of the anastomotic insufficiency rate from 10,0 % after CAA to 5,4 % after CPA.	1.3197286427839385
Therefore creation of a colonic J-pouch should be combined with coloanal reconstruction if the oncologic situation allows a sphincter-preserving procedure.	0.7653508538228464
Background: Workers in the construction industry carry an increased risk for head and neck cancer due to the high consumption of alcohol and tobacco plus exposure to occupational carcinogenic or co-carcinogenic agents.	1.1802202012241685
These latter substances include asbestos, tar products, metal dust, wood dust, cement dust and paints.	0.7593412909839409
Presently, there are no well-defined standards for documentation of echocardiographic studies.	1.1811964316211538
Nevertheless, standards are essential to provide comparability of data and to realize electronic communication, both essential for quality management in echocardiography.	1.2332301098941003
Embolia cutis medicamentosa (Nicolau Syndrom) is a very rare complication of intramuscular injections which presents with extensive necrosis of the injected skin area.	1.0720267862700301
Intra-arterial and/or para-arterial injections after prior perforation of certain vessels are discussed as possible pathogenetic mechanisms.	0.9266837076548787
We describe the occurrence of embolia cutis medicamentosa after intra-articular injections into the knee.	0.9823397998003245
In a 30-beds-unit of the Orthopedic University Clinic in Bochum for an example we studied the frequency of combined injection therapy with local anesthesia and chirotherapy in a one year period.	1.046997801870336
There have been done 191 injections into ileosacral joints as well as 28 injections into facett joints of the cervical spine and additionally 315 into facett joints of the lumbar spine.	0.9102638703428695
On the other side there have been done 122 chirotherapeutic maneuvers at cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine by senior doctors with education in manual medicine.	1.062871089106511
The injection therapy however was done in mean predilection sites of the patients suffering from cervical spine disorders or low back pain, the chirotherapy was done in other spine areas.	1.1435899248655803
The growing number of doctors with an education in manual medicine seems to improve the chirotherapy of the mean pathology as well, but it is not able to reduce the number of local injection therapy.	1.1081962286064162
In a retrospective case control study at the University of Frankfurt, Germany, 101 babies born to opiate-addicted mothers were identified from birth charts from 1988 to 1995.	0.961292475903965
After birth, they developed a withdrawal syndrome (neonatal abstinence syndrome).	0.915020027112188
Fifty control infants and their mothers were selected from neonatal wards.	0.8424654718679125
The group of opiate-exposed babies was subdivided into a group born to mothers without methadone treatment (n=48) and a group born to mothers who were enrolled in a methadone program (n=51).	0.9569954501561779
The methadone infants had a significantly higher mean birth weight (2822 g) than children in the group without methadone (2471 g).	1.122899795384005
The abstinence syndrome was much more intense in the methadone group (convulsions 47.1%) than in heroin-exposed babies without methadone treatment (convulsions 27.1%).	0.9927248050275004
Women in methadone maintenance programs lived in more stable socioeconomic conditions than opiate-addicted women without methadone substitution.	0.7982916009059121
Moreover, they cared significantly better for their babies: 81.3% of the methadone mothers visited their children on a regular basis and 90.9% cared adequately.	1.2345726815836893
The data emphasize the need in future research to look more closely at the role of methadone treatment programs in the development of opiate-exposed babies.	0.9246728170615672
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease of high penetrance and variable expression.	1.1508482172524743
Epidemiologic data on craniofacial manifestations are still lacking.	0.6373605218541376
Up until now 74 patients with NF1 have been treated at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the University of Hamburg.	1.0713699196593274
Forty-two patients presented periorbital and orbital neurofibromas varying in extension and in the severity of findings of the affected site.	1.1271703797979695
Surgical therapy is mainly based on tumour reduction, frequently combined with face-lifting.	0.9158783623709921
In our experience neurofibromas of the neck tend to be pseudo-encapsulated, facilitating the preparation of the tumour.	1.085777537575126
On the other hand, identification and preparation of diffuse infiltrating neurofibromas in the trigeminal nerve region are difficult and local recurrence must be expected.	0.9043116135464312
Objective: The revised Edwards-Duromedics valve was introduced onto the market in June 1990.	0.8697188191383939
In September 1993, the producer changed the name of the valve to TEKNA, which is a low profile, bileaflet, mechanical prosthesis with a self-irrigating hinge mechanism.	1.0991869492255246
The results of a prospective follow-up study after valve replacement with this prosthesis are presented.	1.3806029503421788
A granular cell tumor is one of the rare tumors of the esophagus.	1.0388568680339614
We present the case of a 65-year-old male patient, who was admitted to our hospital for an elective cholecystectomy.	1.0083666871256105
In the routine diagnostic gastroscopy an intramural tumor in the distal esophagus was incidentally found.	0.9546346472945905
Repeated endoscopic biopsies did not reveal the histologic diagnosis, although endoscopic ultrasound invasion to the tunica muscularis could not be excluded.	1.0337034025693452
After indicating the operative therapy, the tumor was removed through a thoracoscopic approach.	1.0111998646095874
The histologic specimen showed a granular cell tumor of the esophagus (tumor of Abrikossoff).	0.9298237453915279
Since the tumor grade was unknown, our therapy seemed to be justified because of the low risk involved in minimally invasive operative procedures.	1.0944588978073908
There has been much discussion and controversy in the literature on this subject, including the potential for malignancy and the correct therapy regime, with a general shift to conservative or minimally invasive treatment.	1.3458772899060014
The case is discussed with a review of the literature.	0.9303117269349026
This review deals with the differential diagnosis and treatment of critically ill neuromuscular patients.	0.7741238177504756
Acute muscular weakness may be a sign of newly acquired neuromuscular disorders or of an exacerbation of a previously existing disease.	0.9531600514866618
Typical features of the more common neuromuscular conditions are presented and the problems of neurocritical care delineated.	1.071534838243182
The appropriate ancillary tests are presented.	0.5295206759569039
Psychiatric care for chronic schizophrenic patients has improved in recent years, but for severely ill patients, often with multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions and in great need of care, the situation remains unsatisfactory.	1.095068573321714
Community-based psychiatric care is limited and psychiatric hospitals are now cutting back on inpatient care.	0.9010286056793293
The quality of care that chronically mentally ill patients receive at independant psychiatric nursing homes removed from population centers is undetermined, and many patients end up in asylums or homeless shelters unable to provide for their psychiatric needs.	0.9276703547419616
Neither a reliable way to assess the needs of these complicated patients nor a scientific basis for therapeutic intervention exists yet.	0.9556787805298235
A diagnostic scoring system, recently published by Ohmann et al.	0.8260282556906093
in this journal, was validated by analyzing the clinicopathological data of a consecutive series of 2,359 patients, admitted for suspicion of acute appendicitis.	1.0374512667168356
The results of the scoring system were compared to the results of clinical evaluation by junior (provisional) and senior surgeons (final clinical diagnosis).	1.1126247929025492
To assess the diagnostic ability of the score, the accuracy and positive predictive value were defined as the major diagnostic performance parameters; the rate of theoretical negative laparotomies and that of diagnostic errors served as the major procedural performance parameters.	1.1571556920746504
Of 2,359 patients admitted for suspected acute appendicitis, 662 were proven to have acute appendicitis by histology, for a prevalence of 28 %.	0.9723617032246465
The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the provisional clinical diagnosis were 0.50, 0.94, 0.77, 0.83, and 0.82; 0.93, for the score 0.63, 0.93, 0.77, 0.86 and 0.84, and for the final clinical diagnosis 0.90, 0.94, 0.85, 0.96, and 0.93, respectively.	1.2320077412420194
Of the main diagnostic performance parameter, the accuracy of the score was signifianctly better than that of provisional clinical diagnosis (P < 0.05, 2 test).	1.00459864923721
The score yielded a rate of negative appendecomies and laparotomies of 14.3 and 12.3 %.	0.8910529345786853
With respect to the rate of overlooked cases of acute apendicitis, the score demonstrated a superior performance, with only 6 cases missed (0.9 %).	1.193934933069987
However, the number of patients with acute appendicitis, including those with perforated disease, who were not identified by the score, was almost four times that of the final clinical diagnosis (245 vs 63).	1.2230169921787624
With regard to the main procedural performance parameter, the score resulted in a significantly smaller number of diagnostic errors than the provisional clinical investigator (P < 0.05, 2 test).	0.9859001502289717
The results of this study indicate that the diagnostic scoring system might be helpful when experienced investigators or additional diagnostic modalities such as ultrasonography are not available.	1.118478801818701
It may therefore be of value in the preclinical evaluation of patients with suspected acute appendicitis and may be instrumental as a quality control tool and in clinical guidelines.	1.0693279703189054
Purpose: The standards and regulations concerning the protection of patients and operator staff within the context of MRI are compiled.	1.1740409817535131
Resulting consequences regarding physical parameters are evaluated.	0.6290196605796863
Replacement of the tracheal conduit remains an unresolved problem.	0.673730801437963
The microporous material expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE) is suitable for tracheal reconstruction.	0.9063620587403503
The aim of our study was to improve the limited mechanical properties of this material by incorporating reinforcement elements and to examine the influence of these elements on host incorporation and epithelialization.	1.1003895140740205
In so dours ePTFE prostheses were reinforced with Ionomer cement and porous high density polyethylene (pHDPE) rings and implanted into the neck muscle of miniature pigs.	0.7827186683702405
One of these prostheses was epithelialized by a cell seeding technique and was thus placed into a tracheal defect.	0.9658363678806305
Results were examined grossly by endoscopy and than by light and scanning electron microscopy.	0.826706410447518
The shapes of both types of prostheses showed a high stability.	0.8801353394937704
The reinforcement elements did not impair bioincorporation or the ability to epithelialize.	0.7342256022010042
In vivo interposition of an incorporated and epithelialized prosthesis to a host led to cell differentiation.	0.7654116247062368
The improved biomechanical properties of the prostheses waid and the reproducible formation of epitheliums are important advances in the solution of effectively correcting tracheal defects.	0.9239552518076017
Primary infection with human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and HHV-7) during early childhood causes permanent latent infection, usually without any ill effects; only a small percentage of primary infections will lead to exanthem subitum.	1.0843326922820677
Like other herpesviruses, HHV-6 and HHV-7 can be reactivated at any time if host defence mechanisms become defective (e.g.	0.7468412291381784
in transplant recipients, AIDS, tumour patients).	0.8018888104991705
HHV-6 can be reactivated under such conditions and cause a variety of clinical problems, such as exanthems along with interstitial pneumonia or hepatitis for example.	0.9887499398397829
In addition, the reactivated virus may influence the course of autoimmune and proliferative diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Hodgkin's disease.	0.9556337159705875
While, HHV-7 may be associated with similar disorders, more systematic studies are needed to clarify the clinical implications and the pathogenetic mechanisms of both viruses.	1.0263516919723559
Pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC) is widely used for monitoring and optimization of hemodynamic therapy in critically ill patients.	0.9478327485610427
Despite its widespread use there is no clear evidence that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by this approach.	1.0925744938097728
In contrast, it has been suggested that PAC might increase mortality.	1.1003725201055912
Available data do not allow the definitive omission of PAC in medical intensive care, nor do they justify its widespread use.	0.8900711320729423
Possible reasons that might affect outcome are catheter-related complications and often misinterpretation due to insufficient knowledge about PAC.	1.0271798352517212
Open questions on the influence of PAC on outcome variables in critically ill patients have to be answered by conducting randomized controlled trials.	1.0038418022229803
Beforehand, knowledge about PAC has to be improved.	0.9475804021881996
As a consequence, PAC should be performed whenever a specific hemodynamic question arises that cannot be answered by clinical judgement or by less invasive means.	0.9911586553110338
It is important that the investigator be experienced in catheter placement and data interpretation to avoid harm to these critically ill patients.	0.8807669341394732
A long-term goal of assisted reproduction techniques should be the development of methods which are able to replace the high-dose stimulation with gonadotropins in order to limit the costs and risks of in vitro fertilization treatment.	1.1219512746786753
The in vitro maturation of immature oocytes derived from follicular aspirates and the in vitro growth of early follicles isolated from ovary biopsies are discussed as possible alternatives.	0.9745113015773176
Both methods are able to shift the application of stimulating hormones from the in vivo to an in vitro level, but are today still far away from being established in clinical routine.	1.0989284028418271
The exact knowledge of the topographic anatomy of the urethra as well as the macro- and microcirculation of the penis [6] are the basics of reconstructive urethral surgery.	1.2160608500246486
Adherence to the fundamentals and principles of tissue transfer [5] are necessary to fascilitate conditions for successful treatment of the various disorders of the male urethra.	1.0835429766150622
Mutural description of the anatomy of the male urethra in conjunction with external male genitals is necessary because of developmental similarities as well as the close anatomical relationship.	1.026035566517026
The arterial and venous blood supply of the urethra and the penis have to be taken into account if vascularized flaps from the penile skin or the prepuce are used in urethral reconstruction.	1.0107915232379274
The dual arterial and venous vascularity of the genital skin is of fundamental importance to a successful outcome of the operative treatment.	1.1219869449359405
The purpose of this article is, to summarize the relevant anatomical knowledge of reconstructive urethral surgery.	1.0765809089916807
In this study the course of osteochondritis dissecans at two often affected areas, the femoral condyles of the knee joint and the talus at the upper ankle joint, is evaluated by studying and comparing the medium-term outcome in 40 patients treated conservatively and 72 patients treated surgically by arthroscopy.	1.2290336449248709
The criterion of assessment was magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which shows a close correlation to the arthroscopic stages of osteochondritis.	0.9642843499150516
The stages on MRI follow the morphology of the interface, i.e., the zone between the osteochondral fragment and the parent bone, on T1- and T2-weighted images.	0.9798867246242626
After 18 and 24 months there were no substantial differences visible on MRI between the two different treatment groups.	1.0600521624066557
In fact, in the majority of cases  (> 60%) the MRI result was the same in spite of the treatment that had been carried out.	1.49624413714851
Arthroscopic treatment compared to conservative treatment resulted in a small percentage in a reintegration in the sense of upgrading on the MRI (36% to 30%); nevertheless, a disintegration could not be avoided in all cases (4%).	1.226329488586035
In both treatment groups the age of the patient seems to play an important role in the course of osteochondritis, juvenile forms following a milder course than adult forms.	1.0018073259096787
The number of women with congenital cardiac disease, who mature into adulthood is increasing.	0.9789308531250114
Unfortunately, there are no prospective data published about the relative risk of different forms of contraception for these patients.	1.0659072906329112
Most women with congenital cardiac disease can safely use oral contracetives, especially low-estrogen combination or progestin-only preparations, with the exception of those, who are at particular risk because of thrombembolic complications (especially in cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger reaction, rhythm disturbances), fluid retention (especially in reduced ventricular function and congestive heart failure), arterial hypertension (important in coarctation), infectious complications (endocarditis) or hyperlipidemia.	1.1748205089655657
Oral contraceptives should be avoided in patients at increased risk for thrombembolic events.	1.1317553486364742
Intrauterine devices are very effective, have no metabolic side effects and merely cary a small risk of endocarditis.	1.0604809700599962
Newer devices containing progesterone only may put the patients at a still smaller risk.	0.8553163156415222
Contraceptive subdermal implants (e.g.	0.2914333649973799
levonorgestrel) are used with good results in the United States for patients with contraindications to estrogen-containing oral contraceptives and may well become more widely accepted in patients in Germany in the coming years.	1.1137883714295167
Barrier methods can be used, but have a higher failure rate, which may be inacceptable in patients at risk (e.g.	1.0817143301838341
Especially in Eisenmenger's, permanent sterilisation should be advised.	0.6289881609270268
Two groups of 15 patients each with disseminated intravascular coagulation in association with septic disease were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin  (lmw-heparin) in different dosages (group I: 1,5-5 IE/kg body weight (BW) per hour; group II: 8-15 IE/kg BW).	1.1549409106252604
We studied the levels of D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 (PTF), and global tests of coagulation like prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), thrombin time (TT) and platelet count, plasminogen activation (PA) and fibrinogen concentration to estimate the success of heparin therapy in the two groups.	1.1311295925051676
TT and fibrinogen concentration were not suitable to follow the course of the coagulation disorder.	1.0864111809182313
PT, PTT, platelet count progressively PA, D-dimer, TAT, and PTF normalised progressively after heparinisation.	0.8945529347133143
However, only the last three parameters were sensitive enough to show different effects of variable dosages of lmw-heparin.	1.1128202862444134
D-dimer, TAT, and PTF levels declined in proportion with heparin concentrations, and thus appear to be the most useful parameters for monitoring the therapeutic effect of heparin in septic coagulopathies.	1.1210440393959151
In patients with acute or chronic myocarditis, arrhythmias are a common and often the only clinical symptom in the natural course of the disease.	1.0344245540251553
The potentially malignant tachy- and bradyarrhythmias are of particular significance in the differential diagnosis of sudden cardiac death in myocarditis.	0.9888407075636146
Factors responsible for the increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias are structural changes, parameters of ventricular dynamics and vascular changes.	0.9615565211502068
On the one hand, inflammatory processes in the cardiac myocytes and interstitium can lead directly to fluctuations in membrane potential.	0.9830843020328303
Fibrosis and scarring of the myocardial tissue and secondary hypertrophy and atrophy of the myocytes favor the development of ectopic pacemakers, late potentials and reentry as a result of inhomogeneous stimulus conduction.	0.9979784534271285
Furthermore, parameters of ventricular dynamics such as increased wall tension, increased myocardial oxygen consumption and diminished coronary reserve in the case of disturbed systolic or diastolic left ventricular function also contribute to the increased incidence of arrhythmias.	1.1700343377311606
Lastly, vascular factors can further increase the arrhythmogenicity of the inflamed myocardium through the disturbance of micro- and macrovascular perfusion and the resulting myocardial ischemia.	1.0846347557956548
Non-invasive rhythmological evaluation by 24 h Holter ECG, measurement of ventricular late potentials and heart rate variability can be used for orienting risk stratification of the at-risk patient with myocarditis.	1.0873703486550155
Programmed atrial and ventricular electrophysiological stimulation also has a relatively high predictive value for spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias.	0.9250021620897516
It should be emphasized that, at the present time, optimal electrophysiological parameters with a high predictive value do not exist.	0.9254878822427041
In a selected patient population, immunosuppressive therapy in addition to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy can lead to the reduction or complete suppression of spontaneous and inducible arrhythmias.	1.0495313079494357
Nevertheless, in the interim, further precautionary antiarrhythmic measures such as serial antiarrhythmic treatment, VT ablation and AICD implantation are necessary in patients with malignant cardiac arrhythmias.	1.1386974728525554
Right ventricular myocardial biopsy for demonstration or exclusion of myocarditis is an important additional examination which can improve the differential diagnosis and treatment of patients with cardiac arrhythmias of unclear etiology.	1.0576072665815814
Aim: To investigate the distribution of collagens in experimental microvascular surgery.	1.0418016060286484
Material and methods: Autografts (4 mm) of the left common carotid artery in 20 Wistar rats were harvested up to 4 weeks after surgery.	1.35129373766707
The specimens were investigated immunohistochemically for the demonstration and distribution of collagen III and IV.	0.8866619510682183
Results: The demonstration and distribution pattern of collagens was a function of the accuracy of each single suture.	1.0913833699039928
In the intima, the organisation and amount of collagen IV was directed to the lumen and dependent on the distance and vitality of the vessel segments.	1.0272509739559357
The media had in its axis direction the lowest reparative potential for regenerating the continuity break.	0.786770273733055
The adventitia formed a thick cuff around the anastomosis, in which collagen III and IV-positive vasa vasorum had grown in a circular fashion.	0.9964935878992159
The marked myointimal hyperplasia in the area around the anastomosis and in the entire autograft was made up of collagen-positive extracellular matrix.	1.0639288629964685
Conclusions: Our results support the demand for a careful and atraumatic suture technique in microvascular surgery.	1.168503804419678
The identification of collagens in rat vessels is a valuable tool for studying wound healing in experimental microsurgery.	0.8621100573094714
We treated 8123 patients with invasive malignant melanoma were treated up to 1995.	0.8152722807261031
2200 had invasive melanomas with less than 0.75 mm Breslow thickness; of these, 45 developed metastases.	1.141867212788392
Three had second primary tumors with greater thickness.	0.7504765001971873
One case showed metastasis from another tumor.	0.7407841001277397
In two cases the metastases were not ascertained histologically.	1.0319117554294088
The remaining 39 cases showed some peculiarities: a greater proportion of late and of internal (as contrasted to regional) metastases.	1.0798317930624237
Most of these primary tumors had a Breslow thickness of more than 0.5 mm and were Clark level III or even IV.	1.0968547027917388
Male patients and primary tumor sites in the area of head and neck were significantly over-represented.	1.012662229704451
In this paper the question is considered to what extent the patient's and analyst's perception and tolerance of both aggressive and destructive elements of the analytic relationship can be increased.	1.2007071932976283
Successful interpretation enables the patient to feel, enact and comprehend animosity in the transference and experience that the relationship can continue.	0.957884255627318
The concept of primary aggression developed in Freud's speculation on death instinct is discussed in its clinical function of relief.	0.9397002778357012
The metapsychological concept of primary aggression facilitates work on aggressive and especially destructive developments of the relationship.	0.9005694423254909
Freud's and subsequently Eissler's examination of the reciprocity of destructiveness and narcissism opened plausible clinical avenues to explain the compensation of defence mechanisms against mankind's vulnerability in the face of mortality.	0.8256011567228152
The concept of primary aggression is obviously of greater relevance than frustration/aggression models since the former does not view the patient as mere victim of his biography, but as a subject with the potential to enact his own destructiveness.	1.007154944156389
Since aggressiveness is often concomitant with fear and suppressed guilt, interpretation plays a decisive role in relieving the superego strain; more confrontation may involve the analyst in the role of the persecutor.	0.9299447249076469
Sudden and violent feelings of hate towards the analyst require careful treatment of the patient's irritation.	1.0378154743696117
Interpretation of genetic causes of animosity often prove to be countertransference resistance; interpretation in transference, however, is viewed as profitable.	0.9365574538553609
Finally, those dangerous and destructive phases of treatments are discussed, which compel the analyst to protect the setting.	1.1475238153845662
Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral agent of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children throughout the world.	1.2014239799328852
Highest hospitalization rates are seen in the second and third month of life.	1.1223563440052622
Young infants, especially those with predisposing conditions such as prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic lung disease (CLD), congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis or immunodeficiency, are the pediatric patients at increased risk for severe RSV disease.	1.1691475565749438
Specific therapeutic options for RSV are limited.	0.7144043132302933
In this prospective study we investigated the efficacy of microcatheter spinal anaesthesia in comparison with a combined spinal-epidural technique in trauma patients.	1.086136579432302
Background: In Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain and Italy, the OPHTEL project combines clinical centers of ophthalmology and internal medicine, an institute for medical informatics and health services research, a publishing company and different industrial partners in the EDP market.	1.0389884111142869
Purpose: A prospective study was initiated for the correlation of the findings in the initial cranial CT with the long-term follow-up MRI in children with severe head injury.	1.2901641983019196
Another aim was the evaluation of frequency and location of lesions, found only in MRI.	0.9441164483560001
A differentiation is made between patient information on findings and diagnosis, patient information on avoidance of known dangers, and patient information on the risks involved in a particular intervention that has been selected.	1.086766875185371
If no information is given on the risks inherent in a patient's condition and how she must proceed in order to ensure that they do not come about, this is considered to be a treatment error, and in these circumstances the intervention is then legally seen as bodily harm.	1.3064610178612979
Information on the risks involved in an intervention must be given in good time, which generally means on the day before the operation.	1.033179443746372
An exception is made to this rule for day surgery.	0.7929575190419448
The patient must be informed about treatment alternatives when the method selected is not the method of choice or when there is an alternative offering equivalent chances but risks of a different kind.	1.1549520502421402
Such information is given to the adult patient who is capable of legal transactions.	1.0147480569072589
In the case of minors or of patients who are not capable of legal transactions their legal representative is responsible for receiving the information [and making decisions].	0.9968502094626208
In the case of unconscious patients everything depends on "presumable consent to the operation".	0.9216057973756633
If a patient later cites lacks in the information supplied to her to support a claim for compensation in a situation where it would be unwise to refuse an operation, she must elaborate plausible grounds for being in conflict over the decision even following appropriate information.	0.9462233144798564
Within the last few years the use of Point-of-Care Analyzers increased.	1.0859165701935043
These testing is primarily performed in the emergency room, intensive care units, and in the operating room using small portable analyzers.	1.2002192098047897
The fact of being transportable and working with rechargeable or changable batteries and disposable cartridges caused us to use blood gas analysis in the prehospital setting.	0.8067768577676658
Patients undergoing major vascular surgery frequently require a substantial intraoperative fluid replacement to assure hemodynamic stability, which is in excess of the expected fluid requirements due to starving, blood and insensible losses.	1.0555618882493274
This leads to a positive fluid balance which can not be readily explained.	0.8893592304913162
The case of a 57 year old patient is reported, who suffered from an acute myocardial infarction with maximum CK and CKMB values of 821 and 84 U/l, respectively.	1.0636952929536458
The patient underwent bicycle exercise testing 9 days after a myocardial infarction in 25 W steps every 2 min starting with 50 W. The ergometry was interrupted at 125 W because of ST segment depression of 0.28 mV in V6.	1.0057766142758742
Systolic blood pressure dropped to 55 mm Hg, combined with severe angina and shock.	0.9497179864032345
Volume substitution and catecholamines did not elevate blood pressure.	0.697293979110482
Immediate M-mode and Doppler echo revealed a "stiletto"-shaped mitral regurgitation profile typical of acute mitral valve insufficiency.	1.0111821159183074
The transesophageal echocardiogram showed a distinct mass moving between the left ventricle and left atrium, diagnostic of papillary muscle rupture.	1.019956317262439
Despite of shock, mitral valve replacement was performed successfully.	0.768432109460634
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a papillary muscle rupture during exercise testing after myocardial infarction.	0.8115635110933653
The flow directed balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter introduced by Swann and Ganz 1970 has made possible the measurement of filling pressures in the heart and is extensively used in operating rooms, in catheterization laboratories and in intensive care units.	0.9713857244828138
The rupture of the pulmonary artery is an uncommon complication associated with a high mortality rate exceeding 50 percent.	1.0729169486725763
Main symptoms are cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea and cardiac shock.	0.8178525618798275
Complications occur if guidelines for the safe use of the balloon-tipped catheters are not strictly followed: Excessive catheter manipulation, advancing the catheter tip too far peripherally and leaving the inflated balloon in the wedge position for long periods should be avoided.	0.9679291331073809
Patients with pulmonary hypertension as well as elderly and anticoagulated patients are at greater risk.	0.9777540597582047
On 90 patients with 93 unstable fractures of the thoracic spine and the thoracolumbar junction we treated by a minimal invasive procedure between may 1996 and april 1998, in 46 patients an endoscopic splitting of the diaphragm was performed.	1.1149514141598513
The diaphragma was dissected at its attachment at the spine and the adjoining costal base.	0.7933022611766776
After partial corporectomy and discectomy, a tricortical bone graft has been inserted.	0.8910803072111386
An additional stabilization was done by using a plate and screw system.	0.9912964395523678
The incision of the diaphragm was closed by suturing or using an universal endostapler.	0.8947919262565113
Controlling the postoperative results a complete closure of the incision was documented by X-ray and CT-scan.	1.0401619421287167
There was no conversion to the open procedure or postoperative infection.	1.004567485261749
Splitting the diaphragma opens also the thoracolumbar junction to a minimal invasive treatment and stabilization of fractures.	0.9123668868478875
This is a report of an interdisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment of stroke, combining a stroke unit and rehabilitation in one clinic.	1.0679413176304822
This series contains unselected patients from a narrow surrounding.	0.7367764040090169
Mean age of 559 patients was 68.7 years (median 70 years).	1.1049233451279168
25% of patients had an initial Barthel index of <30, 20% presented with TIA's and PRIND's.	1.2557890856867349
9% suffered from cerebral hemorrhage.	0.9536366454346847
The unbroken chain of care allowed a relative short length of stay in the acute care (9.4 days) without prolonging the rehabilitation phase.	1.1576650270368762
The one month mortality was 6.7%, one year mortality 18.3%.	1.2453012315290348
Discharge to a nursing home was necessary in 5.4%.	0.916965809320495
Overall more than 90% of our patients have been treated continuously in our clinic.	1.1311699912826447
Combining modern diagnostics with early onset rehabilitation seem advantageous.	0.7452590640508376
About 220 knee endoprostheses are implanted at our clinic annually.	0.7500955472917237
This is a routine procedure for the instrument staff.	1.1173797877905725
Practice has shown, however, that deficient operating room management as regards the instruments, implants, operating room staff, and surgical planning causes problems.	1.1729466800240766
As a result of this, a prophylactic search for sources of error began (risk management).	1.0101003351369022
If the sources of error are found, described, and remedied, knee endoprosthetic surgery will be successful for both the patient and the surgical team.	1.1591558657071475
Cooperation and communication among manufacturer, surgeon, and surgical nursing staff should serve to minimize forensic risks.	1.0703779728632568
The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis since viable pathogen has been recovered from plaques.	0.7642488077039539
Chlamydiae are epithelial pathogens notorious for causing persistent infection.	0.6004375031037835
Atherosclerosis, however, is a chronic inflammatory disease involving mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall.	1.2293402472105768
A bacterial contribution to atherosclerosis appears more relevant if the resident mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall that constitute the plaque can support chlamydial infection continuously.	0.8502945240878685
The study consists of a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.	1.235847079755382
Besides medical and sociodemographic data, two personality factors - self-efficacy and locus of control - were found to predict postoperative pain.	1.3370816345020748
Self-efficacy describes the expectations of a person to successfully execute the behavior required to produce behavioral outcomes.	0.907482792494935
Locus of control, in the extreme case, is a personality factor which is represented by an internal orientation in which the individual believes that rewards are brought about by his own action, versus an external orientation, in which the individual believes that rewards are the result of powerful others or chance factors and fate.	1.0647143780315287
We postulate that the two personality factors correlate with postoperative parameters of pain and that there are also multiple correlations between them.	1.101825536622773
At present there is neither an completely inert biomaterial available, nor does a universal test exist which objectively evaluates biocompatibility.	0.8784790472471861
One reason is the individuality of the host, especially with regard to the inflammatory response.	1.239455455906855
Inflammation was found to induce biodegradation by hydrolysis or auto-oxidation of vascular prosthetic matrix after implantation.	0.8594383890885658
The present study was performed to investigate the specific humoral immune response after implantation of segments of a collagen-impregnated polyester prosthesis (Dacron) in Balb/c mice on experimental days 1, 18, 38, and 322.	1.1960611843693254
Serum antibody detection was performed by modified enzyme immunoassay using the prosthesis as a target.	0.9827502383426465
Specific polymer antibodies, enhanced by repeated implantations, could be detected in all mice which received grafts up to experimental day 322.	0.9703745781079489
These antibodies were not directed against the collagen coating.	0.8008899543911067
The antibody formation could be further enhanced by a combined administration of complete Freund's adjuvant together with the first implantation at experimental day 1.	0.9284763346977
Results suggest that specific polymer antibodies, reflecting an inflammatory response, might be an additional parameter for biocompatibility testing of vascular prostheses.	0.8643276636882921
Twenty-nine unicondylar fractures of the distal femur were treated at the Trauma Center "Bergmannsheil", University of Bochum, Germany, between 1981 and 1994.	1.2519261519666751
All patients sustained their injuries from severe direct trauma.	0.7025341283501001
There were 16 lateral condylar fractures, 7 medial condylar fractures and 6 tangential posterior ("Hoffa-type") fractures.	1.2166705914718556
Twenty-eight closed injuries and 1 grade IIIB open fracture were included.	0.8661540015950396
Eleven patients sustained concomitant injuries to the skeleton.	0.7067174630166866
All fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with screws within 8 h of admission.	0.8254650640943545
Postoperative management consisted of early continuous passive motion and minimal weight-bearing for 6-8 weeks, progressing to full weight-bearing.	0.8631892997750421
The mean follow-up was 68 months (18-120).	1.1095616349096202
The therapeutic outcome (clinical result, radiographs) was rated by the Neer score.	1.1567924909950817
Twenty-seven patients were available for follow-up examination.	1.0856466640255018
Of these, 23 were rated as excellent.	0.9497050923286207
3 achieved satisfactory results, and 1 had an unsatisfactory result.	1.144316237467721
All patients who did not achieve an excellent outcome had had accompanying injuries.	0.9900224255860749
Open reduction and internal screw fixation of unicondylar femur fractures provided overall excellent long-term results.	0.8668258021626327
The therapeutic outcome was significantly affected by associated injuries of the skeleton.	0.9983431778712677
The realization that a disease will not respond to a curative treatment causes massive fear and anxiety in affected patients, but also feelings of helplessness and insecurity in health professionals caring for the patients.	1.0823036233556038
The global fears of affected patients can be divided into three main categories of problems; stepwise mastering of these problems may help to maintain or restore an acceptably high quality of life according to the WHO guidelines for palliative medicine.	1.023495226835768
In light of the anxiety felt by physicians and others caring for this patient group, palliative psycho-oncology must offer patient-centered holistic care in which the psycho-oncologist is not an isolated therapist but rather a member of a team made up of physicians, nurses, religious workers, psychologists, ergotherpists, physiotherapists, social workers, and especially family members.	0.9675855760093344
Together, this group of health professionals and family members caring for the affected patient form a group that itself receives care as needed.	0.9886278001235694
Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) with hepatic vein occlusion is a rare disorder that can effectively be treated in advanced stages with orthotopic liver transplantation.	1.1422647500546002
We report on 16 patients who received 18 liver grafts and were followed up for at least 2 years.	1.1820771361926166
In 7 patients a hematological disorder was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy.	0.9844835181450986
One patient died after 4 months due to cytomegalovirus pneumonia; another patient died after 2 years due to progressive liver failure after portal vein thrombosis.	1.0687711181311152
The actuarial 5-year survival rate is 87.5 % compared to 85.3 % in all other 710 orthotopic liver transplantations performed from September 1988 to December 1995 at our institution.	1.209315332115164
Anticoagulation consisted of intravenous heparin and overlapping continuation with dicoumarin.	0.7055391036450777
Three patients received hydroxyurea for thrombocytosis, one patient for 1 week only early after the transplantation.	1.0665535094683016
Two postoperative abdominal hemorrhages required laparotomy.	0.545325525265362
Two patients had to be retransplanted, one for thrombosis of the hepatic artery and portal vein after discontinuation of dicoumarin due to GI bleeding and one for hepatic vein thrombosis after insufficient dicoumarin intake.	1.0398499408965702
Terminal BCS represents a good indication for orthotopic liver transplantation; however, life-long, closely monitored anticoagulation is essential.	1.007029293241572
Postmenopausal estrogen-replacement therapy maintains bone density as assessed by densitometry of skeletal sites relevant for future fracture.	0.8289747175047832
Optimal doses are 2 mg oral estradiol, 0.625 mg conjugated equine estrogens, 1.25 mg estrone and 50 µg transdermal estradiol.	1.0324679885425803
There is a role for calcium supplementation in individuals with non-optimal dietary intake of calcium.	0.9179874546128699
Observational studies suggest that estrogen replacement reduces the future risk for hip fracture by 25 %.	0.9038675228815525
Discontinuation of replacements is associated with an increase of fracture risk few years later.	0.9365458408678402
It is noteworthy that there is a lack of formal fracture studies providing data on the efficacy of estrogen replacement for primary prevention of osteoporosis and for secondary prevention in terms of treatment of women with established osteoporosis, with a diagnosis based on WHO criteria.	1.0782945012426508
Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, and tibolone, a synthetic steroid with weak estrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic properties, may constitute alternatives to estrogen-replacement therapy.	1.0753447379488184
Raloxifenen maintains bone density in and reduces vetebral fractures by some 50 % in women with prevalent osteoporosis.	1.1224038234771594
Artificial insemination from donor (heterologous insemination) is a rationally based treatment in complete male infertility.	0.9694378701235609
In this overview the enlarged knowledge on semen donors, the receiving couples and the development of the offspring will be summarized.	0.9886098498871047
Although motivation of men towards semen donation is predominantly based on financial expectancy, most of the donors agree to offer the offspring not-identifiable information on biological and social characteristics.	0.920890685231851
Semen donation does not enhance the risk of consanguinity and of genetic diseases in the population.	0.8999552106522789
The decision to undergo heterologous insemination is a burden for the couples.	0.8747691419097016
Retrospectively, however, the majority state positive influences of the insemination on their partnership.	1.0986685499230244
The most important question is whether they should disclose the insemination to the children.	0.9727183068628851
The course of the pregnancy and the postnatal development of the children do not differ from those of children of natural procreation.	1.1610160277320154
They receive more love and care than "usual" children.	0.7173539888517043
Their rights concerning the insemination, however, are poorly considered.	1.056823667323386
If we agree that the knowledge of genetic descent is part of human rights, non-disclosure of the donor insemination to the children raises severe ethical problems.	0.9509003335250128
The extended field of view imaging procedure named "SieScape" provides, for the first time, a mode of establishing in real time a sonographic picture up to 60 cm in length.	0.9989067363324494
This allows the display of large organs or tumors as well as large areas of the body in a single view, without having to assemble several pictures.	1.1207742465830797
Furthermore, pathological find-ings can be shown in full size in their surroundings.	1.1163982969471111
This method makes it considerably easier to convey sonographic results to the therapist who is not present at the investigation and to control a finding, for instance a tumor, during therapy.	1.0923015982286783
Heart rate variability (HrV) has been established as an important risk parameter in patients surviving myocardial infaction.	1.0638163181455944
Recently, analysis of HRV - particularly of the standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) - from short term ECG recordings has been proposed as an alternative to that from 24 hour Holter monitorings.	1.1956692977286512
The present study is the first to compare SDNN from short term recordings to that from 24 hour recordings with respect to risk stratification after myocardial infarction.	1.114097560233872
In 60 patients at the time of discharge from the hospital, SDNN from Holter monitoring averaged 93  +/-  30 ms compared to 39  +/-  18 determined from short term recordings.	1.071882856443275
Patients with a prospectively defined clinical endpoint differed significantly from those with an uneventful course with respect to age, left ventricular ejection fraction, mean RR interval from Holter recording ( 753  +/-  153 vs 921  +/-  132 ms), mean RR from short term recording (783  +/-  153 vs 914  +/-  163 ms), and SDNN from the Holter recording (71  +/-  27 vs 97  +/-  29 ms; p < 0.001) However, patients with and without clinical event could not be seperated by means of SDNN measured from short term ECG registrations (35  +/-  22 vs 41  +/-  19 ms; P = NS).	1.1591173689193173
Thus, SDNN measured from short term ECG recordings does not seem to be useful regarding risk stratification of patients after myocardial infarction.	1.0296270330064956
Analysis of HRV should be performed using 24 hour Holter monitoring, which provides more information and reflects circadian fluctuation in autonomic tone.	1.0772217008185905
Glomus tumors (glomangiomata) are benign tumors arising from glomus cells.	0.9303738073189112
Multiple glomangiomata are less frequent and less painful than the solitary variant, which is usually located subungually.	1.1264291316503852
Nonetheless multiple glomangiomata - sometimes being sensitive to pressure and changes in temperature - may cause considerable discomfort.	1.1675927347427044
Treatment of multiple glomangiomata is problematic because of the often large number of tumors.	1.0085016543299146
Sclerotherapy represents an alternative to surgical and cryosurgical therapy.	0.8691324284326811
We report on sclerotherapy in a 35 year old female patient with multiple hereditary glomus tumors.	1.2072352790694483
Conventional echocardiographic methods of measuring left ventricular mass (LVM) are limited by assumptions of ventricular geometry and image plane positioning.	1.0230166198953723
Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography offers a promising new approach for more accurate determination of LVM.	0.8582736424266292
This study was performed to compare LVM measurement by one- (1D), two- (2D), and 3D echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients (pts) with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).	1.3849792739540374
Determination of Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) can be performed through washout methods, indicator gas dilution or bodyplethysmography.	0.8982875023836049
Some of these techniques have been adapted for use in intensive care patients whilst being mechanically ventilated.	1.2095398813853497
However, most measurement setups are bulky, cumbersome to use and their running costs are high.	1.1420785679208225
Hence FRC measurement has not become a routine method in intensive care although it offers considerable advantages in the management of ventilated  patients such as the determination of "best PEEP", the detection of progressive alveolar collapse in the course of acute lung injury and during weaning from mechanical ventilation.	1.070287548317558
Up to now most efforts to improve and simplify FRC measurement were made at the expense of accuracy.	0.9011483205821392
An ideal method ought to be accurate, easy to handle and cost-effective.	0.8847251789218853
It should supply not only FRC data but also information about intrapulmonary gas distribution and dead space.	0.804215473948299
These demands can be met using modern data acquisition software.	0.7643536321555828
The pros and cons of all methods available for FRC measurement are discussed in view of their suitability for intensive care patients.	1.0689076668930197
A conventional nitrogen washout using emission spectroscopy for measurement of nitrogen concentration gives satisfying exact values for the determination  of the parameters mentioned above.	1.0686557955103724
The measurement error can be lowered under 5% by special corrections for flow and  nitrogen signal (delay and rise times, changes of gas viscosity).	1.0803432607204402
For flow measurement a normal pneumotachograph can be used.	0.9123695274338456
Using a laptop computer for data  acquisition the bed-side monitor fulfills most of the demands in intensive care.	0.8640845658685202
It is then also possible to measure indices of intrapulmonary gas distribution such as Alveolar Mixing Efficiency and Lung Clearance Index.	0.8305200348089385
Three strategies are followed in handling the key issue within the field of action of care and services for the elderly: securing the material needs of those requiring care, creating appropriate care structures, and providing an effective counselling back-up to alleviate interface problems.	1.0809831816473336
Thouse latter, process-oriented aids, have been the subject of discussion and further development under the key term of case management for a good decade.	1.168778746076536
The aim in this context is to prevent the elderly from being unnecessarily moved into residential care, to stop the revolving door syndrome, to ensure that older people can stay in their homes, to support family members acting as care providers, to enhance the quality of services and those to ease the strain on fund providers.	1.158813578279934
In the context of case managment, these diverse tasks are performed by three basic substantive functions: the gatekeeper, broker, and advocacy functions.	1.0927664207579886
Each of these three functions characterizes the main variants of case management with a different weighting (care management, community care, managed care and case management as a counselling approach with a particular focus on individual help).	1.0525005881796918
Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a bullous autoimmune disease of the elderly; it is characterized by tense bullae on both erythematous and otherwise apparently normal skin.	1.0580707626896697
Several clinical variants of BP have been described, and we now add our observations of two BP cases mimicking subacute prurigo.	0.9600913053896885
Both patients had suffered from intensely pruritic excoriated papules for several months before presentation.	0.8018109365580117
Blisters had never developed and did not occur during follow up.	0.9342746394874509
Histology showed changes of chronic dermatitis.	0.6884032527050982
In the serum of both patients, indirect immunofluorescence on NaCl-separated human skin revealed the presence of circulating antibodies binding to the roof of the artificial blisters.	0.9634528364425842
Perilesional skin biopsies showed linear IgG or C3 deposits in the basement membran zone.	0.7949732326155149
Immunoblotting of epidermal and dermal extracts demonstrated the binding of the antibodies to an epidermal 230-kD protein, which is the known major bullous pemphigoid antigen.	1.0149209100274634
These cases are described as a basis for discussion of the clinical spectrum of bullous pemphigoid.	1.0213327467150037
The distal metatarsal osteotomy according to Magerl allows correction of a hallux valgus deformity by lateral and plantar displacement as well as by pronation and varisation.	0.9320377587922557
The length of the first metatarsal can be adjusted by the depth of the cut at the resection or by a slightly oblique osteotomy.	1.034124623796862
If necessary, soft tissue release and/or a osteotomy of the first proximal phalanx can be done to relocate the sesamoids under the head of the first metatarsal.	1.100384073946267
A review of 118 foot operations in 75 patients demonstrated a very good or good result in about 75 %.	0.9866845868938493
Radiological examination showed sufficient lateralisation of the metatarsal head.	0.7065089198666457
Evaluating the length of the first metatarsal and the amount of variation, the results were less satisfying.	1.3218516710907608
The metatarsophalangeal angles could be corrected by 14  ° and the intermetatarsal angles by 7  ° on average.	0.9381651932515273
The sophisticated operative procedure limits the use of this technique as a standard procedure.	1.171304279173685
The contribution of Rudolf Virchow to dermatology seems to have been forgotten, or present-day dermatologists are not aware of it.	1.0029889831941425
The present historical review is intended to show that Virchow's thoughts and the terminology created by him are still alive.	0.8357846540397684
The report encompasses a short biography, including Virchow's nonmedical activities.	0.9047468129701784
It starts with early experimental publications, which laid to the foundation for his fame, and with dermatological studies of his early period.	1.1366682405119926
This is followed by a detailed description of his contributions pertaining to dermatology in his largest work, "Cellularpathologie".	0.9741555369314254
Special mention is made of Virchow's lasting contributions to medical, and particularly dermatological, terminology.	0.9655413364857732
Finally, his historical studies, his latter small publications on topics in dermatology, his pupils and scientific friends, and the social-political and anthropological activities of later years are discussed.	1.1908436204277018
Thus, a multifaceted picture is painted of a still modern pathologist who has influenced dermatology in multiple ways.	1.0094060260986704
Starter's pistols are often bought for self-defense, but can also be used for criminal activities (e.g.	0.9113154195780068
assaults, etc.).	0.42461011813243815
When a starter's pistol is loaded with blank cartridges and is fired, a powerful shooting noise results.	0.8556172952141213
The level of the noise produced is high enough to cause acoustic trauma.	0.8586883832918328
For legal examinations and giving an expert opinion further information is needed about the power of such noise.	0.9193492772457821
We examined how high peak sound pressure levels were of the gunshots of blank cartridges and whether there existed any directional characteristics from the noise emissions.	0.856085658513082
In all, 15 different models of starter's pistols of 8 different calibres were examined.	0.8804859458441676
In addition to blank cartridges, 8 mm tear gas cartridges were also examined.	1.0680105945281373
Four transducers were situated in the horizontal plane around the muzzle: 0 ° (shooting direction), 45 °, 90 °, and 180 ° (towards the firer).	1.2178440187259965
The distances between the transducers and the muzzle were 25 cm, 50 cm, 100 cm, and 200 cm.	1.0582760557972066
At a distance of 1 m and in the 0 ° shooting direction the peak sound pressure levels of nearly all weapons tested exceeded 160 dB.	0.9321533443274497
At a shooting distance of 25 cm the peak sound pressure levels reached 181 dB.	0.7658044926539975
In addition, we observed a directional characteristic concerning the emission of noise: pistols produced higher peak sound pressure levels to the front than backwards towards the firer.	1.0478540071566462
Owing to their rare incidence, foreign body injuries in the region of the orbit, skull base and skull have up to now mostly been treated in  the literature by means of case reports.	1.1093927349571888
Here we present our experience and treatment regimen for ten patients we have treated during the last 3 years.	1.124840760783347
In seven cases the foreign body was located in the orbit alone, whereas in three others the orbit and the frontal base were equally involved.	1.054116105599776
Except for one case, the foreign material could be removed completely.	1.020313700197954
Three patients suffered from partial or complete loss of vision and one patient developed a psychosyndrome during the follow-up period, but no late effects were registered in the remaining six cases.	1.194847544934073
Before removing the foreign body and carefully reconstructing the accident, however, we strongly recommend the documentation of possible functional deficits, preferably by means of photography.	1.058890047569191
CT is the method of choice for localising the foreign body, except for the depiction of wood particles.	0.9505488865648747
Here, sonography and MR should be performed.	0.9042350681622386
As the therapeutic approach, the cooperation of an interdisciplinary team of ophthalmogists, neuro- and maxillofacial surgeons seems mandatory.	1.0816094939882166
To avoid inflammation, the immediate removal of the foreign material is recommended in cases with considerable intracranial lesions: post-operative neurologic and intensive care monitoring should be provided.	1.131838812919165
Treatment is completed by high-dose antibiotics, using CSF-soluble substances and, if necessary, anti-convulsives.	1.0217189007292116
Rocuronium is a new nondepolarizing muscle relaxant for which a fast onset has been described.	1.0610249045056614
The goal of this study was to examine whether the characteristics of rocuronium could make it an appropriate relaxant for the anaesthetic management of operations of intermediate duration such as endoscopic upper airway surgery.	0.9704121617011493
These operations, which require the anaesthesiologist and surgeon to "share" the patient's airway, require good muscle relaxation for endotracheal intubation and placement of endoscopic instruments.	1.1361057380601598
In addition, the time course of neuromuscular blockade and its relation to the quality of intubating conditions were analysed.	1.0357825442208934
Patients and methods: In order to better define the potential advantages and risks of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), we designed a prospective study including 73 eyes.	1.1512248547066977
Treatment of tachycardic atrial fibrillation (AF) is difficult in patients with congestive heart failure because many drugs which exert negative dromotropic effects (beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists) may depress ventricular contractility and/or decrease arterial blood pressure.	0.9660948517903537
We have identified 2 intravascular sites in the superior (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) where parasympathetic nerves, which innervate the atrioventricular node, can be stimulated electrically.	1.083289755434936
In 8 dogs, a 7-F catheter with an expandable electrode basket at its tip was non-fluoroscopically positioned in the SVC and in the proximal IVC (time for positioning: 3-5 minutes).	1.1543044554320638
High-frequency electrical parasympathetic stimulation (PS) with 20 Hz at an impulse duration of 0.1 ms was performed during pacing induced AF.	1.0996766656882617
Results: With increasing stimulus strength, a graded ventricular rate slowing was observed during PS in the SVC and IVC (P<0.01, ANOVA).	1.0895594144669931
The negative dromotropic effect started instantaneously after onset of PS and ceased immediately after termination of PS.	0.8249096312722091
During ventricular pacing at a constant rate, no decrease of the arterial blood pressure was observed during PS.	1.248231361655575
PS in the IVC yielded significantly lower stimulation thresholds than in the SVC.	0.9707685719912292
Conclusions: Transvenous parasympathetic stimulation for ventricular rate control during AF can easily be achieved in the SVC and IVC in dogs.	1.0384646304682696
This procedure may provide a foundation for investigating the usefulness of PS in humans.	0.8200517662109483
If the results translate to patients, PS may be very beneficial in the treatment of AF in patients with congestive heart failure.	0.9263402172745796
A total of 86 patients suffering from fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were followed up after an average time period of 57 months (12-98).	1.1627905023988474
Of these patients, 56 were treated operatively and 30 conservatively.	1.0498626074037387
According to the AO/ASIF classification, 66% of the operated group were fractures of type A, 29% of type B, and 5% of type C. All patients were operated on by means of dorsal locking instrumentation with pedicular fixation and, apart from six patients, with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting.	1.3884873290878303
The conservative group was treated according to the guidelines of Böhler with closed reduction, plaster cast, and rehabilitation program.	1.0401449534204261
All fractures in the conservative group were of type A.	1.0863215743335077
Charcot foot in its original sense is equivalent to stage 4 of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) which is known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease since 1886.	1.0317129217535612
This entity, which can be subdivided into 3 groups including subgroups, predominantly begins during childhood and progresses slowly.	0.9031591031822002
The first symptom, often unnoticed by the patient for a long period, is weakness of the intrinsic foot muscles with consecutive hammer-toe formation and mobile pes cavus.	1.2351398596409229
Progredient atrophy of the peroneal, extensor, tibialis posterior and finally triceps surae muscles leads to fixed pes cavus varus excavatus with severe varus deformity of the hindfoot, secondary varus position of the talus at the ankle level and subsequent arthrosis of the medial compartment.	1.0439535732087237
Permanent varus deformity of the ankle almost invariably leads to stress fractures of the malleoli because of repetitive microtrauma (stage 5 of HMSN).	1.0509504226177566
The alveolar adenoma of the lung is a rare benign tumor in which the normal parenchymal architectur is imitated by a proliferation of both the alveolar epithelial cells and the mesenchymal septal cells.	1.126136297993106
The first description, based on six cases, was published in 1986 by Yousem and Hochholzer.	1.0425698793839566
From their ultrastructural findings they presumed a type II pneumocytes differentiation of the epithelial cells.	0.9200913837912237
We investigated an alveolar adenoma of the lung immunhistochemical by means of antibodies against apoprotein B and C of human surfactant.	0.9356742406361391
Both the lining cells and the macrophages in the alveolar-like spaces were stained.	0.9679412737632956
The septal connection tissue cells did not react.	0.5797972180649467
These findings confirm the expression of surfactant constituants and, hence, the differentiation into type II pneumocytes of the epithelial cells of the alveolar adenoma.	1.0924791281470208
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in women, whereas it is rare in men.	1.2724732921442437
In our own case series the ratio is 175 : 1.	0.9620671928046086
The present paper deals with an evaluation of clinical and morphological findings from a series of 54 de novo male breast cancers observed in our institution from 1978 to 1996 and a comparative discussion of 528 female breast cancers from the same geographic area.	1.0618129576239665
We should like to focus on the following observations:	0.8226194429038391
Patients with congenital varicella syndrome develop cicatricial skin lesions and microphthalmia.	0.8649220208497203
An overlap in the clinical manifestations exist with a specific genetic disorder, called MIDAS syndrome.	1.0088491145157295
It is due to a partial deletion of the short arm from chromosome X, with consecutive monosomy Xp22.3.	1.0411771199093807
The rapid development of recombinant DNA technology and our enhanced understanding of the genetic basis of human disease has facilitated the development of new molecular therapeutic modalities, termed gene therapy.	1.017252886924197
Gene therapy involves the transfer of functional genes into somatic cells and their expression in target tissues in order to replace absent genes, correct defective genes, or induce antitumoral activity in the tumor-bearing host.	1.0605962547534107
Currently, an increasing number of gene therapy strategies are being investigated in experimental and clinical trials.	1.18163091521664
Despite substantial progress, a number of technical and logistical hurdles must still be overcome before gene therapy can be safely and effectively applied in the human patient.	0.9545335407513666
Since gene therapy involves complex cell processing and can be time consuming and costly, simplifications or even alternative approaches will be necessary in order to establish this therapy as suitable for clinical use.	0.973941328281787
This report reviews various gene therapy stategies and gene delivery techniques currently under clinical or experimental investigation.	0.806667875790688
Special emphasis is given to cytokine gene therapy using gene-modified tumor vaccines for cancer treatment.	0.7984747429188553
Using the PTB simulator, which emits real signals from patients, we examined the precision of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement with the Dinamap 1846 (Critikon) and the HP M-1008B (Hewlett Packard).	0.9688701600740189
For this purpose we simultaneously registered invasive arterial pulsewave, cuff pressure and cuff pressure oscillations of 20 patients from our intensive care unit and stored them in the database of the simulator.	1.0418042769793594
The invasive reference blood pressure values were determined following the recommendations given by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.	1.0248558403776986
The invasive system showed a cut-off frequency of 35 Hz; the damping constant was 0.21.	0.9344817841440125
With 49 record signals from patients we carried out 15 simulated measurements each.	0.7534052605960163
From a total of 49 bio-signals from patients the Dinamap 1846 was able to process 41 signals and the HP M-1008B 47 signals.	0.8683208003941376
The mean error of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement of the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure amounted to -2.50 mmHg, 3.35 mmHg (P<0.05) and 1.51 mmHg with the Dinamap 1846 and to -8.5 mmHg (P<0.001), -5.15 mmHg (P<0.001) and -5.58 mmHg (P<0.001) for the HP M-1008B.	1.151694939306131
The 95% confidence limit for the systolic, diastolic and the mean arterial pressure amounts to 56 mmHg, 30 mmHg and 35 mmHg for the Dinamap 1846 and 50 mmHg, 38 mmHg and 35 mmHg for the HP M-1008B.	0.9236700613532962
The differences between that two instruments could be caused by the different algorithms for the calculation of blood pressure values and different artefact detection and elimination techniques.	1.0476892969826421
The results of the performance tests we achieved with the PTB simulator correspond to the results of other clinical examinations.	1.0555704516537872
The American Association for the Advanecement of Medical Instrumentation recommends a maximum mean error of 5 +/- 8 mmHg.	0.9456296839894406
None of the examined instruments lay within these limits.	0.9458008284717453
Due to the systematic and stochastic errors, we think that the Dinamap 1846 (Critikon) and the HP M-1008B (Hewlett Packard) do not achieve performance levels that are adequate for measuring critically ill patients.	0.9077532244438256
Many patients consulting medical emergency services make the initial contact because of psychiatric emergency situations.	0.7992372608138216
However, emergency physicians and their assistants are usually not sufficiently experienced in psychiatry.	1.2906828958042469
Therefore, psychiatric emergencies are sometimes only reluctantly accepted or inadequately treated by these services.	1.1038966482485375
Our present contribution aims at improving this situation.	0.6505129050765107
It gives a review of the main diagnostic groups concerned, their symptomatology and psychopathology, and offers some advice with regard to empathic verbal interventions and counselling in those emergency situations.	1.0863119741731475
3 different types of complex spinal trauma are defined: Type I means a multilevel contiguous or non contiguous unstable injury, type II is described as a spinal injury with concommitant thoracic or abdominal lesion, typ III stands for the coincidence of spinal injury and polytrauma.	0.9830561577602581
Overlapping of different types occurs.	0.8210778760273986
Type I: The incidence amounts according a german multicenter study to about 2,5 %.	1.1509534314419423
Multilevel injuries need to be stabilized for a long distance from posterior.	1.0189167572213145
With a thoroughful analysis the segments to be fused are determined.	0.7818292606262581
Typ II: The leading thoracic injury is a lung contusion which occurs in up to 50 % of the cases.	1.0873212122101383
A CT scan of the thorax during the first diagnostic screening is recommended.	1.029492407817204
Early reduction and stabilization from posterior should be aimed at.	0.7583261336858542
During the first two weeks anterior procedures are contraindicated.	1.0275789821157126
Abdominal injuries are to be found in 3-4 % of all spinal injuries.	1.249906852718086
All organs could be affected.	0.5270211432453983
A typical constallation is the "seat-belt syndrome" with lesions of the upper abdominal organs and a flexiondistraction injury of the upper lumbar spine.	1.064904232442816
The main problem is to make the diagnosis of both components initially.	1.1611152564365272
Most of the patients may be treated in one operation by first taking care of the abdominal injury and than stabilazing the spine.	1.2088484795811703
The prognosis of this combination is favorable.	1.0203670617612706
Typ III: In 17-18 % of all polytraumatized patients lesions of the spine are to be diagnosed.	1.3002401358942475
From these only one third need surgical care.	0.8158352175784963
From 680 patients with operatively treated fractures of the thoracolumbar junction 6,2 % were polytraumatized according to the multicenter study mentioned above.	1.2039700768636112
The risk of missing a spinal injury in polytrauma totals approximately 20 %.	0.7646678610508231
Surgical stabilization should be performed in the primary phase (day-1-surgery).	1.2110098289543125
Additional injuries, potentially time consuming operations with a high blood loss sometimes necessitate a different approach.	1.000765580629818
Non stabilized spinal injuries apparently do not have the same negative effect on the whole organism as long bone fractures.	0.9819643384849697
In the early phase of treatment on the C-spine only anterior procedures and on the thoraco-lumbar spine only posterior techniques should be applied.	1.0491091027857087
Experimental studies have shown that in traffic accidents with frontal impact the new airbag system can significantly reduce the incidence of severe injuries and fatal outcome.	0.9448274720469626
The question of whether the airbag itself induces specific patterns of injury needs further investigation.	0.8861703602077999
Two cases of traffic accidents with airbag protection are presented here.	0.9298831549128214
The first case report clearly shows the life-saving and injury-reducing effect of the airbag system in a traffic accident with frontal impact at 100 km/h.	0.9922372918753176
In the second case only minor injuries of the face were diagnosed initially.	1.111673338439663
Hemodynamic instability occurred after 3 h of hospitalization due to rupture of the azygos vein.	0.8677642195468299
Analysis of the presented cases shows that, besides the well-known benefits, there are certain injury patterns that seem to be related to the use of airbags.	1.0852682075995304
These have not been described before.	0.654381039903352
It is concluded that patients who were involved in traffic accidents with airbag deployment have to be hospitalized and followed up carefully over time, even though they are initially stable, as potentially fatal sequelae of deceleration trauma can occur later.	1.10437698057777
In our opinion it is not possible to estimate the severity of airbag-associated injuries with conventional methods.	1.0458772218213217
A questionnaire with 78 questions concerning the situation of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) sufferers in Germany was distributed to a representative 3000 out of the more than 14000 patient members of the German AS society; 1614 patients (54%) responded.	1.1714514297332559
The age distribution of these patients roughly agrees with that expected due to the distribution of the age at diagnosis and the age distribution of the German population.	1.2832756889240093
The group of patients more than 65 years old is, however, under-represented.	1.1607554766744503
Introduction: Headache is thought to be generated by nociceptive processes within the meninges, followed by activation of trigeminal neurons within the brainstem.	1.053846462010438
The noxious stimuli initially involved in these nociceptive processes are unknown.	0.7529210587240246
A preparation was developed in the barbiturate-anesthetized rat, in which the activation of trigeminal brain stem neurons by selective local stimulation of the dura mater could be observed.	0.9673044912279734
Atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial disease of the arterial wall, dependent on genetic disposition and multiple other risk factors.	1.0515055784798684
There are probably several candidate genes, that determine the individual susceptibility of the vessel wall to develop atherosclerosis.	1.0651229796109258
In recent years, a growing number of gene polymorphisms, associated with an elevated risk of myocardial infarction, has been identified.	1.2011006206829733
These genes and gene clusters play a crucial role in lipid metabolism, regulation of blood pressure and clotting.	0.9765690351711882
In contrast to rare monogenetic diseases with severe clinical signs and symptoms (e.g.	0.8089574724777594
familial hypercholesterolemia), genetic polymorphisms are relatively frequent.	1.0894624170232414
Due to their frequency, there is a high probability that one individual carries several alleles predisposing to coronary heart disease.	1.0133544708156288
Genetic polymorphisms become clinically important by interacting with lifestyle, environmental factors or endogenous metabolic disorders.	0.8120060798106636
Fourty-nine patients with 50 complex acetabular fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation from August 1993 to February 1996 in a prospectively documented study.	0.9130982815243484
The fractures were fixed with small fragment implants through a modified extensile iliofemoral approach (Maryland approach).	0.782459673642075
Thirty-seven patients were polytraumatized with an ISS of 20 pts.	0.8903585753139734
In 10 patients the ISS was > 25 pts.	1.1309880615777215
Good or anatomic initial fracture reduction with a fragment stepoff K 2 mm could be achieved in 48 fracturers (96 %).	0.9392384294083725
Thirty-six patients with 37 fractures could be evaluated after 25 months on average.	0.8684432691022639
In 28 fractures (76 %) the functional outcome was good or excellent according to the d'Aubigne and Harris scores.	1.1064342794346256
Radiological results were excellent in 21 fractures (57 %) and satisfactory in 12 fractures (Heeg score).	1.0185634516581012
In 7 cases (14 %) a postoperative subcutaneous seroma had to be treated surgically.	1.0497483153990632
No wound infections, however, were observed.	1.3034667211214777
Further complications were secondary a loss of reduction in 4 cases (11 %), relevant heterotopic ossifications (Brooker III/IV) in 5 cases (14 %), and aseptic femoral head necrosis in 2 cases (5 %).	1.11817615239375
In two cases a total hip replacement (THR) for posttraumatic arthritis had to be performed.	1.1132616798853794
Two more cases are scheduled for THR due to symptomatic femoral head necrosis.	0.7314950122944642
A good joint reconstruction can be achieved through the modified extensile iliofemoral approach (Maryland) in complex fractures of the acetabulum.	1.0675299709587773
However, the approach related morbidity seems to be worrysome.	1.0451669407810766
In complex fractures with comminution in the roof of the acetabulum the prognosis remains uncertain even in cases where initial anatomic joint reconstruction can be achieved.	1.05346948683274
The discussion on the results of open spinal surgery, in particular, on complications as a result of open surgery, e. g., the so-called post-discotomy syndrome, has led to the development of less invasive methods, especially for treatment of lumbar disc prolapses.	1.1756602032691603
Percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are based on a variety of intradiscal diagnostic and therapy methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal spinal disc fenestration or chemonucleolysis.	1.04373862997543
Since the 1970 s, various methods such as mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures and, in part, endoscopic intradiscal procedures have been developed and also used clinically.	1.0818795887259158
The clinical results vary from 30 % good/very good results to almost 100 % good/very good results, depending on the author and study.	1.0316650576777888
It is obvious that not many prospective randomized studies using either conservatively or surgically treated control groups have been conducted.	0.9003344857922625
The results of these studies on intradiscal therapy methods are often analyzed more critically and with lower success rates than the partially retrospective studies of a single method, which often have large case numbers, but do not always meet the demanding criteria for scientific study design.	1.1334606593001288
To attain good results, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only be used to treat select cases of lumbar disc disorders according to strict indication criteria.	1.0537369786499768
At the present time it can be concluded that, in comparison to endoscopic und microsurgical methods, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures must be restricted to a small number of cases.	1.0960891704870002
A 58 year old patient with hepatitis virus C (HCV) infection had a secondary polyclonal IgG-IgM cryoglobulinemia with a benign 20 year course.	0.9677637798946644
Clincally the patient suffered from progressive pigmented purpura (PPP).	0.7009826270917515
Histologic evaluation revealed a lymphocytic vasculitis.	0.5345710582605337
Food containing tartrazine trig- gered flares of the PPP, as demonstrated with controlled oral provocation testing.	0.9277299147385543
In most of the previously described cases of HCV and type III cryoglobulinemia, the typical cutaneus finding was palpable purpura with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.	1.0612362075760382
Normal aging is associated with changes in body composition, thirst perception, renal function, and the hormonal regulatory systems involved in the maintenance of water and sodium balance.	1.0393219063499597
The presence of many diseases and drugs common in the elderly can interact with the impaired homeostatic systems to result in clinically significant disturbances of water and sodium with accompanying symptoms, morbidity, and mortality.	1.0407948961951201
These disorders, which include dehydration, hypernatremia, hyponatremia, urinary frequency, and urinary incontinence can either be prevented or promptly recognized and appropriately treated by understanding the physiological changes and clinical circumstances which put the elderly person at increased risk for deranged water and sodium balance.	1.0808545618666927
Although valvular stenosis may be evaluated adequately by measuring transvalvular pressure gradients with Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization, these methods have failed to provide reliable and accurate quantification of valvular regurgitation.	0.9742542402490929
In recent years the development of magnetic resonance imaging has broadened the diagnostic spectrum in cardiology, since it allows assessment of ventricular volumes without geometrical assumptions and the non-invasive quantification of blood flow within the heart and great vessels.	1.1525327785994786
The purpose of this overview is to evaluate "established" diagnostic tools and to show the capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of valvular heart disease.	1.170296234658025
Solvent induced polyneuropathy and encephalopathy have been acknowledged quite recently as occupational diseases in Germany.	0.7601613144413514
For compensation first of all the diagnosis has to be proven.	0.9947294701715936
For differential diagnosis other known causes as well as non-organic mental diseases must be taken into consideration.	0.7156647716820328
The causality between proven exposures and diagnosed disease has at least to be probable.	0.7686103841284185
To evaluate causation extensive experience of the experts is needed.	0.7224851076781741
In this context scientific criteria regarding neurotoxicity of the solvent, duration of exposure, individual aspects of non-occupational influences, time course of the disease are important within a thorough synoptic evaluation.	1.1247280122088306
Possibilities and limitations of sensitive diagnostic measures such as neurographic, neuropsychologic and neuroimaging examinations are discussed.	0.7048348885704755
The prognosis of toxic polyneuropathy and encephalopathy is in general favorable if exposure has stopped.	0.8999360839614197
Additionally, adequate therapy and rehabilitation measures are supportive for a good prognosis.	1.1937655277812051
Standard radiography of the cervical spine is still the first imaging procedure applied in degenerative disease of the cervical spine.	0.9882301962769768
Spondylosis deformans, osteochondrosis and uncovertebral arthrosis are well depicted by such images.	0.762615456798273
Whether or not additional imaging is needed depends on the clinical symptoms.	0.9732618988537658
Special projections (anteroposterior oblique radiographs, lateral radiographs in flexion and extension) may be the next step.	1.0596613642877595
For many abnormalities, mainly of the intervertebral discs and the myelon, MR imaging has become the standard procedure, largely because of its multiplanar capabilities and its excellent contrast resolution.	1.1431775510333526
CT can be used instead of MR imaging if the latter method is not available, and its strength lies in the depiction of bone abnormalities.	1.1298558421034561
Scintigraphy is suitable for early detection of abnormalities with unclear clinical symptoms and may then indicate the correct level of the cervical spine for MR imaging or CT. Myelograms and myelo-CT can no longer be considered routine imaging methods.	1.0088473699288072
A number of imaging abnormalities are not strictly related to clinical findings and should therefore always be discussed in the clinical context.	1.264459051753971
We report on three years of experience with a new method of a simultaneous endoscopically assisted anterior release in the prone position, combined with transpedicular posterior scoliosis correction and fixation.	1.148054608170683
In 60 cases this simultaneous approach yielded substantial advantages.	0.6637996715185955
True derotation of the apex - even in the thoracic spine - is achieved.	1.3381022046732973
In cases of total canalicular occlusion or the total absence of the lacrimal apparatus the functional restoration requires the repair of a newly created lacrimal system.	1.0710796764955208
The intraoperatively reestablisted lacrimal drainage from the conjunctival sac will be maintained by a plastic tube.	0.7791557598215745
Beside other criteria the influence of the used inserted materials polyethylene or silicone should be evaluated.	0.9435042881430329
A prospective, randomized and controlled trial is conducted to compare carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting in high grade symptomatic carotid artery stenoses.	0.9218590212525474
Magnetic resonance imaging is used routinely with much success for various problems in different medical disciplines.	0.9896245019070288
However, the patient is exposed to static as well as to time-dependent magnetic fields and radio-frequency electromagnetic fields.	1.2507952338070352
In 1997 the Strahlenschutzkommission, the German Radiological Protection Commission, passed a recommendation on the use of magnetic resonance in medical diagnostics.	1.0690713728333958
In this recommendation basic values related to thresholds for physiological effects and limits for restricted and unrestricted use are given.	0.8158259233567778
In the following the aim and applicability of this recommendation are discussed, as well as the thresholds and different limits for the static magnetic fields, the gradient fields and the radio-frequency fields.	1.0987518562910508
Additionally, advice is given for the protection of high-risk patients, personnel, and the general public, together with further safety advice as well as recommendations for users and manufacturers.	1.2204472411084015
Six patients with granuloma faciale, including patients with multiple lesions, were treated successfully with cryosurgery.	1.318972338802227
Granuloma faciale is known to be difficult to treat.	0.8539066401759664
Cryosurgery is an effective and minimally invasive therapy for this granulomatous inflammation of the skin.	1.0740405854675514
It should be considered as an alternative to dapsone.	1.1585875172968536
The results of early conversion of war fractures by the application of AO osteosynthesis in A group (n = 32) of the injuried, were compared with B group (n = 187) of injuried, treated definitely with external fixator.	1.324824252199147
There were statistical evaluations and X-ray observations of healing in both groups, as well as the appearances of the most frequent complications such as: Pintract infection, osteitis, pseudoarthrosis and reoperation.	1.064171158331791
Statistically less significant appearance of complications in A group during 2th and 6th month (p < 0.001) was observed.	1.0128368456067067
In 12th month of observation, these differences statistically disappeared.	0.952838923326361
Healing observed by X-ray in 2th, 6th and 12th month of observation were no statistically significant differences between the two observed groups.	0.9113707156635436
Since 1993, 30 patients with acute intraarticular distal radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance.	0.7584750084110786
In 12 patients (40%) concomitant lesions of the intrinsic scapholunate ligaments were diagnosed.	1.0184346758911575
According to Geissler we found grade I-tear in one patient, grade II in three, grade III in six and grade IV in two patients.	1.0028956669202087
The eight individuals with grade III-and IV-lesions additionally revealed marked instablity intraoperatively.	0.8856228343562091
Therefore, operative stabilization was subsequently performed by temporary scapholunate and scaphocapitate arthrodesis.	1.15390227216592
Seven patients out of this group (87.5%) were followed up clinically and radiologically 3 years postoperatively, on average.	1.1818416491902666
Clinical examination included range of motion tests and a subjective questionnaire concerning pain and working ability.	0.8397137909613155
Objective grip strength was measured using a Jamar tester and compared to the contralateral wrist.	0.9097315771790916
Radiological evaluation consisted of the posteroanterior and lateral view as well as stress views in radial and ulnar deviation.	0.8108683972867506
Data were evaluated by the Jakim and Cooney scoring system as well as the demerit point system by Gartland and Werley as modified by Sarmiento et al.	0.7369029370505515
According to Gartland, 100% of our patients showed an excellent result; these rates were 86% using the Jakim score and 60% using the Cooney scoring system.	1.0860139858388558
According to the subjective questionnaire all of the patients revealed an excellent or good result.	1.1673165265411722
Open treatment of shoulder instabilities is well accepted and still golden standard.	0.9460473322847673
But arthroscopic techniques show also good and comparable results.	0.7767222037798697
Arthroscopic procedures however are not accepted for treatment of failures and revision cases.	0.8122340573425842
Therefore we questioned whether a arthroscopic revision procedure is an option after failed first time open or arthroscopic stabilization.	0.9525942154663591
This prospective study was designed to assess the outcome of arthroscopic revision procedures after failed shoulder stabilization.	1.0071503140410063
In 1991 the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest with Doppler sonography was accepted by the Medical Council of the Bundesaerztekammer as one of the methods able to shorten the waiting time for fulfilling the criteria for diagnosis of cerebral death.	1.0448852461002183
A survey was undertaken to determine how frequently Doppler sonography has been used since that time in certifying brain death.	0.8894280761827866
A total of 400 questionnaires were sent out to all neurological (272) and neurosurgical (128) departments in Germany.	1.0387494162726598
In all, 226 questionnaires were returned.	0.6220808037122482
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography has been used to certify brain death, mostly combined with other methods.	0.9439792071994478
The question of whether false positive results have been observed was answered five times in the affirmative.	1.0553393056187792
The background to these cases was clarified by telephone calls.	0.8483694673447996
In order to indicate pitfalls, the examiners reported borderline situations which in part did not fulfil the prerequisites.	0.938641112195193
In none of these cases had the diagnosis of brain death been based on ultrasound data.	1.1972409444582601
Doppler sonography for the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest has been used by a considerable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments in Germany as an additional confirmatory test and rather seldom as the only method to shorten the waiting period.	1.128798423088654
We report on a 64-year-old man who died within 1 h after admission to hospital with symptoms of respiratory insufficiency.	1.1665314572343732
Autopsy showed as cause of death a clinically unknown coagulase-negative staphylococci-induced left-sided endocarditis with perforation of the aortic and mitral valve.	1.0132993016911012
Infective endocarditis by coagulase-negative staphylococci in native valves is a rare event.	0.9069545712249241
The macroscopic appearance and histological findings are presented and discussed.	0.8152323271985707
Thrombolysis therapy in childhood and adolescence has brought about numerous case reports, but no controlled studies over dosage and duration of therapy have been published to date.	1.1067015053379379
Laserotoscopes are suitable for low-pain outpatient surgery of otitis media with effusion (OME) under topical anesthesia.	0.9000426708411462
The myringotomy perforations should have a diameter greater than 2 mm to ventilate the middle ear for approximately 3 weeks.	0.876831230245097
Comparison by skin epiluminescent microscopy of 60 malignant melanomas and 130 junctional and compound naevocellular naevi revealed statistically significant differences for 12 characteristics.	0.877836136353129
The following microscopical in vivo signs that can be defined by histopathological examination were found only in malignant or premalignant melanocytic lesions: digitated radial streaming, greyish-blue reticular patterns, opaque gypseous alabaster lacunas, brown/black dots on a blue/greyish background, pseudopodia at the periphery and blue-in-pink areas.	0.8810113117079007
Nevertheless, specific epiluminescent phenomena of histopathologically defined malignant melanomas are still unknown.	1.0475851376201504
Therefore, diagnostic evaluation of malignancy is based mainly on microscopic assessment of combined details of morphology and colour of melanocytic tumours.	1.1729008185259215
The present study examines the relationship between different psychological variables (including anxiety, depression, locus of control, expectations of pain intensity and social support) and postoperative pain, analgesic consumption and satisfaction with the pain management in a study sample of 67 patients.	1.1754977189454534
Clinical experience of 11 patients with CHARGE association is reviewed.	0.7116028864642967
The study comprised six girls and five boys.	0.6597020347395417
All presented with congenital heart disease.	0.625770465919292
Eight had bilateral choanal atresia.	0.4934168053183771
Coloboma affecting either one or both eyes was detected in nine children.	0.8874021824797901
Nine patients suffered abnormal pinnae or deafness.	0.6048932963496345
In addition to major abnormalities, further anomalies of the orofacial region and the upper airways occurred in all patients.	1.0878349008466277
All children exhibited velopharyngeal incoordination and swallowing problems often resulting in recurrent aspiration pneumonia.	0.6898764391574393
Three patients had cleft lip and palate.	0.8616993783010753
Both micrognathia and high-arched palate were present in two patients.	0.8500642610999625
Facial palsy was observed in six patients.	0.7551289568313514
Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach with active coordination and cooperation between the appropriate specialities.	0.8566884879848384
The anatomical repair of bilateral choanal atresia should be performed as early as possible.	0.8914728212968465
In our experience, the transpalatal approach is far more satisfactory than the transnasal.	0.9281311062193944
It gives the surgeon the opportunity of direct access and anatomical repair.	0.8734193113787646
After the child has grown stronger, a long-term management is desirable including developmental and feeding training.	1.077905012110186
Thrilling are especially those situations, when people have to make ethical decisions.	0.9725838767608252
Issues of medical ethics crop up not only in hospital series, but often in genres where this subject is hardly to be supposed: comedies, westerns, love stories and gangster movies.	1.00311102503451
Enacting these conflicts means offering a solution, and in doing so films refer to moral values and - at the same time - function as seismographs for the social relevance of bioethical topics.	1.1921795144217628
But it is possible that ethical principles of good decision-making fall victims to the drama of the story.	1.046842517273456
Analysis of the portrayed conflict is similar to a case discussion in bioethics and represents a helpful adjunct to the procurement of analytical and communicative competences.	0.8356126501761549
Several experimental studies and randomized clinical trials demonstrate a decrease of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment time of fractionated radiotherapy.	0.9298243698260431
Proliferation or clonogenic tumor cells most likely is the major mechanism underlying this phenomenon.	0.8898823877127284
Important progress in radiation oncology might therefore be expected from inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment.	0.8561922971650715
Possibilities to minimize the time factor are briefly discussed.	0.9444435760539915
Inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by inhibition of signal transduction pathways that stimulate proliferation, or by pharmacological inhibition of angiogenesis are scientifically interesting but currently not proven to be effective to counteract the loss of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment of fractionated irradiation.	0.9567378251458324
At present, the only established approach is to complete radiotherapy within a short overall treatment time, e. g. by accelerated fractionation and by prevention or compensation of unscheduled treatment gaps.	1.0172747161046274
Technical innovations and software improvements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-resolution sonography (US) have definitely influenced the diagnostic imaging of rheumatic diseases.	1.0236814399431267
For MRI, improvements in surface coils, dedicated low-field systems (0.2 T), and software improvements (shorter acquisition times and refinements of fat suppressing techniques) must be mentioned.	1.0310332839037832
For sonography, the main innovations concern the development of higher transducer frequencies (7-15 Mhz) and power Doppler imaging.	1.2497505197074528
Clinical evaluations have shown that MRI and US are most useful in cases of suspected rheumatic disease with negative plain film radiographs and for documenting the course of the disease, diagnosing of early rheumatoid arthritis, making a differential diagnosis in clinically unclear rheumatic diseases, investigating vascularization, and quantifying pannus formation.	1.0311763275812362
In order to improve diagnostic efficacy the role of MRI and US in the management of patients with rheumatic disease should be reconsidered.	1.0961537102584256
In addition to renal elimination and gastrointestinal metabolism (amylase; splenic and hepatic dextranase) colloid plasma solutions like dextran and hydroxyethyl starch deposit in tissues, especially in the reticuloendothelial system (RES).	0.8910661778438
This tissue storage is limited in time (weeks to months), is influenced by the employed solution and other factors (lysosomes) and has usually no clinical importance (no RES blockade).	1.247068223418485
We report here a case study of a patient with sepsis (lung, liver and kidney failure) who had an overload of the RES with colloids while being treated with dextran (molecular weight 40000 and 70000 daltons) and hydroxyethyl starch (mw 450000 daltons, molar substitution 0,7).	1.0792782223073707
In the late seventies and early eighties the toxic shock syndrome (TSS) became epidemic among young menstruating women.	0.8537867775292487
A strong correlation was found between TSS and the rising popularity of hyperabsorbent tampons.	0.9218124012833627
Exotoxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus is seen as the main mediator of TSS in controlled clinical trials.	0.9171832132927901
Menstrual and nonmenstrual forms of TSS are differentiated.	0.6726954747704303
The nonmenstrual form is comparatively rare and has a high rate of mortality rate.	1.0039954032969343
Several studies showed that the overall incidence of menstrual and nonmenstrual TSS is approximately 1-3 cases per 100 000 persons.	1.0409322443716775
The leading symptoms are fever, hypotension, mucous membrane hyperemia, diffuse rashes, myalgias, vomiting and diarrhea.	0.8538559468231791
The severe form of the syndrome leads to multiorgan dysfunction.	0.892098588550077
The streptococcal TSS (STSS) caused by group A Streptococci is clinically similar to the staphylococcal TSS.	0.8776510038689639
Both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococci produce the exotoxin TSST-1.	0.5728459840153414
New methods allow the detection of TSST-1 production.	0.6151154467921917
However, due to the low incidence of TSS, this method of detection has not yet been taken up in the routine diagnostic procedures.	1.339021547329313
This report focusses on the emergence and spread of S. aureus with special clinical and epidemiological significance.	0.970798569053175
Results from typing MRSA originating from different clinical sources in all Germany reveal that there is a continuing interhospital dissemination of definite epidemic strains and also a spread of the mecA gene to clonal groups of S. aureus which have been until now sensitive.	0.9695605725104716
These newly emerging MRSA are still sensitive to a number of other antibiotics.	0.8341717217573128
This results in less broad resistance phenotypes of currently disseminated MRSA.	0.8062210715998427
Worth mentioning with regard to diagnostics are also three clinical cases of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by S. aureus possessing secC and not tst.	0.9204067982154983
Background: For cataract surgery in this country retro- and peribulbar anesthesia is the standard method.	1.3603707542273713
It totally stops eye movement as well as sensitivity to pain.	0.7627208831128756
Especially peribulbar anesthesia is known as a procedure with minimal complications, but the potential risks can be severe.	1.1894421696824549
In the past sponge anesthesia could not be used on patients with difficult cataract surgery due to the insufficient anesthetic effect.	1.0406721423010448
A modified anesthetic method is demonstrated for complicated cataract surgery.	0.7971324533443471
In patients with coronary artery disease, it is controversial whether cardiac arrhythmias result from acute subendocardial ischemia.	0.9928264546860573
The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmia.	0.8206824970888267
The immunopathogenesis of cardiac rhythm and conduction disorders has been underestimated.	0.8122714794981785
Therefore, the aim of this review is to analyze the current data and controversial issues in this area.	1.0332121515923782
We report the case of an 8 year old boy with a rare congenital myopathy (with cytoplasmic inclusions bodies) and clinical signs of rigid-spine-syndrome.	1.125149231273993
During treatment of lung tuberculosis disordered breathing with hypoventilation during REM-sleep, hypoxemia and persistent hypercapnia during daytime were found.	0.81031724843492
This complication in myopathies is caused by weakness of respiratory muscles and leads to negative features (like pulmonary hypertension, daytime-sleepiness, growth failure or further impairement of the muscle disease).	0.9123845526703599
Diagnostic steps in disorders of breathing during sleep in children with neuromuscular disease are shown.	1.004665894822825
Aortic dissection with no entry or false lumen flow was recently identified as intramural hemorrhage of the aortic wall (IMH).	0.9470642882346128
Analysis of the literature revealed 209 cases of in vivo diagnosed IMH reflecting 17% of all dissections, whereas in autoptic studies this condition is found in 4-13%.	1.298055075269363
Transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and aortography (to rule out dissection) have been applied for diagnosing IMH in 57, 49, 43 and 38% of the cases, respectively.	1.0659293440476811
However, diagnostic accuracy of each modality is not available to date.	1.3784350714182751
In 34%, IMH involves the ascending aorta (type A).	1.0087977728729567
The average age of patients with IMH ranges between 55 and 65 years; 65% are males.	1.1247441625454873
In 12%, IMH was associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm.	1.0228765793169088
With 87%, arterial hypertension is the predominant risk factor for IMH irrespective of its location.	1.1468465737881417
As suggested by the term "mediastinal apoplexy" IMH may - similar to cerebral apoplexy - result from hypertensive rupture of the vasa vasorum in the aortic media.	1.078670154947173
With 97%, the majority of patients present with acute chest or back pain similar to classic dissection.	1.1039395743742164
Mediastinal widening is found in 83%; signs of hemothorax/pleural effusion are present in 38%, acute aortic regurgitation in 26%, pericardial effusion in 23%, acute neurologic deficits in 12%, and pulse deficits in 5%.	1.2231640227321285
In 18%, IMH progresses to dissection and in another 15% to rupture.	1.435869676307979
In 25% and 28%, respectively, dissection and rupture occur in the ascending aorta and in 12% and 9%, respectively, in the descending thoracic aorta.	1.4583698895878376
The 30-day mortality of IMH is 24% (36% with type A and 12% with type B IMH; p<0.05).	1.0551112988134967
With surgical repair, mortality of type A IMH is lowered to 18% compared to 60% with medical treatment (p<0.01).	0.9610925572426803
In contrast, with 8% mortality associated with medical treatment, prognosis of type B IMH is more favorable without surgical intervention, the latter associated with a 30-day mortality of 33% (p<0.05).	1.1512699265564703
Thus, IMH is a potential precursor of dissection and should be managed like dissection with undelayed surgical intervention in patients with type A IMH and with medical treatment in type B IMH.	1.205407286182433
We report on 3 exemplary case studies of patients with myelomeningocele who are under regular care in our outpatient clinic, and discuss the clinical and diagnostic problems and the therapeutic concept of fractures in patients with myelomeningocele.	1.3395994713289578
Our case reports are in accordance to previous publications; they show that signs of confined and systemic infection and variable X-ray signs with often extensive reactive formation of callus make the diagnosis of fractures in myelomeningocele patients difficult.	1.0654691159433807
Fractures often occur without pain or trauma.	0.6709474883442532
Background: Since the end of the 1960ies, accidents have been identified as the most common cause of mortality in children and account for considerable childhood morbidity in industrialized western countries.	1.2113286686598763
In contrast to traffic-related accidents in older children and adolescents, which were consequently registered and documented, no epidemiological data exist about home injuries and accidents during the first years of life in Germany.	1.2939120400845354
This report presents data on accident-related hospitalizations in a cohort of 10271 infants, who participated in a prospective vaccine efficacy trial in Germany from 1991 to 1994.	1.0529568298987728
One-hundred-thirty patients underwent 53 electrophysiological studies including programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation and 96 atrial overdrive stimulations on an outpatient basis.	0.8937928629418084
The indications for electrophysiological study were disabling palpitation, syncope, or presyncope, intracardiac conduction disturbance, and bradyarrhythmia.	1.021646210130549
In one patient the efficacy of oral antiarrhythmic drug therapy was evaluated by repeat electrophysiological study.	1.0382569606603387
Atrial overdrive stimulation was performed in patients with atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia.	1.0986560272152153
On the basis of the result of electrophysiological testing, 25 patients were believed not to require any treatment, 16 patients received new drug therapy, 7 patients underwent catheter ablation in a second session, 2 patients had either a pacemaker or an ICD implanted, and 1 patient continued to receive the drug therapy that had been tested.	1.3085412661491063
Atrial overdrive stimulation resulted in a regular sinus rhythm in 66 patients (69%).	0.8259785827832946
Except for one patient in whom atrial flutter could not be terminated, atrial fibrillation was induced in the remaining 30 patients.	1.1521463008074517
After the procedure, patients were monitored for 30 min in case of overdrive stimulation, and for approximately 3 h after electrophysiological study or 6 h if additional coronary angiography had been performed.	1.1704988734129802
Severe complications were not observed.	0.5198781435485983
In 10 cases minor hematoma occurred at the puncture site without serious sequelae.	0.8491548324230054
- Outpatients electrophysiological study as well as atrial overdrive stimulation are feasible and safe in a selected group of patients.	0.9955910471765097
Endosteal implants after tumor surgery of the face are helpful in reconstructing facial defects.	0.9082668855136753
A retrospective study of our patients treated using craniofacial implants was conducted to evaluate long-term results.	1.2163243169798117
A total of 128 implants were inserted, 110 implants in the periorbital, 12 implants in the mastoid, and six implants in the paranasal region; 113 implants were short craniofacial Brånemark implants, and 15 implants were dental implants.	1.1351742350255962
The success rate for implant survival was 94.5%.	0.9590837277420273
Long-term results were promising and more than satisfactory, leading to a large indication for these endosteal implants.	1.1959628549932328
The term "Ecstasy" includes a group of different methylenedioxyamphetamines which produce hallucinogenic activity, stimulation and the so-called 'entactogenic' effects.	0.8996892618376862
- "Entactogen" is usually translated as "producing a touching within" or "creating an internal contact" and refers to the special psychotropic effect of this substances.	1.1531996917744065
Entactogens have been reported to make users aware of previously unconscious feelings and experiences.	0.9493320087965746
The "entactogenic" effect is the most typical of the psychedelic effects n 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA).	0.9948410926294303
MDMA induces euphoria and acts stimulating, but the most common effect of MDMA is a heightened sense of "closeness" with other people.	1.200022863139929
The negative effects, especially depression and a general sense of anxiety, may endure after the acute phase of ecstasy.	1.2608814106252935
Ecstasy is not a novel substance.	0.9412903028288258
However, the rapid spread connected with the arising techno-scene and the increasing prevalence of ecstasy-use world-wide is unprecedented.	1.0626851580871592
Cisatracurium - one of the ten stereoisomers of atracurium - is an intermediate long-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.	1.1936791981743369
Cardiovascular reactions have been described after administration of cisatracurium or vecuronium in surgical patients.	0.9011661850441933
After approval by our institutional review board, 62 patients (ASA I-II) were randomly assigned to three groups to either receive 3xED95 or 5xED95 of cisatracurium or 3xED90 of vecuronium prior to intubation as a bolus.	0.7961119508553249
After oral premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam anaesthesia was induced with thiopental (4-12 mg/kg) and maintained with O2/N2O and isoflurane (1.5%-2%).	0.92987596981574
Six minutes after administration of thiopental, patients received the muscle relaxant.	1.120539590053264
Six minutes later 0.1-0.2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated.	0.8295121818296736
Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were monitored every minute.	0.7578047312481697
Changes of heart rate or blood pressure >20% compared to baseline were defined as clinically significant.	1.066042042667597
After application of the study drug, median values of blood pressure and heart rate were stable.	1.1015104126457267
For each muscle relaxant, there were several patients who had statistically significant cardiovascular changes.	1.0971652190583792
After 3xED95 cisatracurium, 3 of 21 patients exhibited haemodynamic changes >20% (2 exhibited hypotension and 1 tachycardia), while in the high-dose cisatracurium group 2 of 21 patients demonstrated a tachycardia that was predetermined to be statistically but not clinically significant.	1.2441011905534571
In the vecuronium group, 2 of 20 patients sustained statistically significant hypotension and 1 patient had statistically significant tachycardia.	1.1248252422983356
The frequency of all individual cardiovascular changes after the application of the muscle relaxant was not dose-dependent.	0.9610069995756471
After the administration of cisatracurium in two different doses (3xED95 and 5xED95) or vecuronium (3xED90) only minor cardiovascular changes were observed.	0.9997655351928904
Both drugs proved to be safe for use during induction of anaesthesia in patients ASA I-II.	0.8871367938309156
With regard to its cardiovascular effects, cisatracurium shares with vecuronium the requirements of an ideal muscle relaxant.	0.9400249374123307
Between June 1993 and September 1995, 18 distal femoral fractures were treated using the supracondylar intramedullary nail.	1.0003787082218747
There were 8 type A fractures and 10 type C fractures (AO classification).	0.8075219204922726
The operative technique involved retrograde insertion of an unreamed supracondylar nail through the intercondylar notch.	0.9024222211274352
Follow-up was available on all patients and averaged 18.3 months (range 6-32 months).	1.2100043690459856
All fractures healed with an average time to union of 12.4 weeks (range 8-16 weeks).	1.3153213784017603
Bone grafting was not necessary in any case.	0.9348925045097669
Sixteen patients achieved almost the same ROM as they had had before the injury.	0.8582070331706462
One patient developed a varus malignment and underwent correction with a supracondylar osteotomy 20 months post trauma.	0.853501700436974
There were no infections or nonunions.	1.0087867512627517
The retrograde supracondylar nail is an excellent alternative to plate osteosynthesis in the management of dia- and supracondylar femoral fractures.	1.0672780059807305
Autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogenic (AAA) bone is an osteoinductive preparation of completely demineralized bone matrix.	0.7953105730539528
It has been clinically applied for years.	0.87361569359265
In an experimental study in rabbits, we evaluated the influence of cortical bone and periosteum on the amount of bone formation following augmentation with AAA bone.	1.069664124937499
Two implants of standardized size were placed on the femoral bone of rabbits.	0.9567121075440351
A cell-excluding PTFE membrane was wrapped circularly around the femur as well as the anterior implant shielding the implant from the surrounding periosteum.	1.093118634783204
The posterior implant was exposed directly to the periosteum while being shielded from the cortical bone by the membrane.	0.9031117067519668
Thus, two compartments were created selectively, preventing contact between the periosteum or cortical bone and the implants.	1.1858553315731781
For each compartment the area and volume of the induced new bone were evaluated by computerized radiograph analysis and quantitative CT (pQCT) scans.	0.9650318446075203
Implantation of AAA bone led to new bone formation in both compartments.	0.8263919762096072
Contact of the periosteum and the implant led to an almost fourfold increase in bone volume.	1.0549084774698405
Although bone formation showed interindividual variations, the difference of both compartments was highly significant using the Student's t-test for paired samples (P < 0.0001).	0.9295147709505356
The data show that periosteum is the primary source of new bone formation in augmentations with osteoinductive materials as it is rich in inducible progenitor cells and is well vascularized.	0.9838208868749284
In osseous augmentations with AAA bone, the periosteum should be preserved in order to achieve a close contact of the osteoinductive implant.	1.0833152909720907
Shielding from the periosteum, e.g., by cell-excluding membranes, leads to significantly less bone formation following implantation of AAA bone and should therefore be avoided.	1.05883007203165
Computed tomography is a significant source of medical radiation exposure for populations in Europe.	0.9230652138362705
Reduced radiation exposure may be possible with modern CT scanners with an image quality that while less good than before remains acceptable for clinical purposes.	0.9001152020960637
The lung appears particularly well suited to investigation with low-dose CT owing to the high contrast between normal and diseased pulmonary parenchyma.	1.05421074952933
Undernutrition, particularly protein undernutrition, contributes to the occurrence of osteoporotic fracture, by lowering bone mass and altering muscle strength.	1.0528610265375187
Furthermore, the rate of medical complications after fracture can also be increased by nutritional deficiency.	1.0459146995153392
The IGF-I system appears to be directly involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to osteoporotic hip fracture in elderly and to its complications.	0.9095799459128474
In the presence of adequate calcium and vitamin D supplies, protein supplements increasing the intakes from low to normal, raises IGF-I levels, improves the clinical outcome after hip fracture, and attenuates the decrease in proximal femur bone mineral density in the year following the fracture.	0.9936170035808306
This nutritional approach is associated with a significant reduction of the stay in rehabilitation hospital.	1.0224245721648149
This underlines the importance of nutritional supports in preventing and healing osteoporotic fractures.	0.7640736269190745
The article discusses changes in the context within which the social professions are exercised.	1.1004706799734527
The chances for a refinancing of social work and indeed its very locations change in line with the transition to new steering elements in the social body and the new implementation of competitive elements in the realm of public law.	0.9543328932490034
With the economising of the social sphere social work is questioned under economic aspects.	0.7859757774530524
Simultaneously it gains normative significance.	0.5376518145434878
This is true with regard to standards for the quality of services and institutions, and further in the context of the discussion concerning the revitalisation of local social policy for the elderly.	1.0549416567829588
Precisely the economising of the social sphere raises the question whether the municipalities may be excused from their responsibility to form, preserve and support the obligations of social work with the elderly.	0.9245142584617951
A comparison was made of the staining intensities of selected immunohistochemical proliferating antigens (p53, PCNA, Ki67), DNA flow-cytometry and ultrastructures of neoplastic cells from 120 cases of laryngeal cancers.	0.9956978066837976
Clinically very advanced tumors were in the majority (T3, 43%; T4, 18%).	1.1336166481669618
A 5-grade scale was adopted to evaluate the level of immunohistochemical staining of the carcinoma cell nuclei.	1.0258365765747621
Positive staining was obtained in 70% for p53, 57% for Ki67 and 80% for PCNA.	1.390385561859933
Sixty-two percent of the cases were DNA-diploid and 38% DNA-aneuploid.	1.069753933391166
The DNA-diploid carcinomas were accompanied by enlargement of the cell nuclei, preservation of wide margins of nuclear heterochromatin, enlargements of the nuclear areas and increases in the number of nuclei.	0.9539128556832178
In the aneuploid-polyploid cancers the nuclei had a substantial polymorphism, with large cleaved nuclei showing significant variations in size and having a nuclear envelope.	0.9105593960539035
A frequent finding was euchromatization of chromatin.	0.5761151657431609
Dense chromatin appeared in the form of small clumps spread over the whole area of these irregular nuclei.	0.8664308694892697
Enlargement and activation of nucleoli were found.	0.626083735305281
The antipyretic analgesics still comprise the most widely used group of analgesic compounds.	0.7580838681019105
Until twenty years ago, aspirin, phenazone derivatives and acetaminophen had been used as standard remedies for intercurrent harmless pain conditions in connection with infections, trauma, small surgeries, but also for tension headache and other painful conditions.	1.0271878036517448
During the last decades, this group has been supplemented by a variety of 2-arylpropionic acids being primarily developed for the treatment of rheumatic pain and inflammation.	1.102978827846773
Some of them (e.g.	0.27487940903158375
ibuprofen, ketoprofen and naproxen) have been given over-the-counter status in some countries because of their relative safety at low doses.	1.0682097801612063
Nevertheless, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences among the various substances of this group make them suitable to a different degree for the treatment of pain conditions.	1.1302424632360666
A 38-year-old man presented with an intracranial extra-axial tumour at the base of the left posterior fossa which proved to be a meningeal melanocytoma.	1.0621576341743533
Meningeal melanocytoma is a rare, benign melanotic tumour of the leptomeninges occuring predominantly in the posterior fossa or the upper spinal cord in adults.	1.001091693929899
It shows characteristic cytologic features with isomorphic epitheloid or spindle-shaped cells, often with prominent nucleoli and a variable content of intracytoplasmic melanin.	0.9250804150224348
It usually lacks signs of malignancy such as high mitotic rate, necroses or infiltrative growth and shows a low labeling index in proliferation marker studies.	0.8658595179491783
Its immunohistological profile with S-100 protein-, vimentin- and HMB-45-positive tumour cells is similar to that of (primary or metastatic) malignant melanoma.	1.2616124994330504
This differential diagnosis is crucial because of the totally different therapeutic and prognostic implications.	1.0804891994222776
Therefore, everyone dealing with surgical neuropathology should be familiar with the rare, but clinically important diagnosis of meningeal melanocytoma.	1.1095811940610403
A 54-year old, obese woman suffered from massive symmetrical swelling of the face, especially of the upper and lower eyelids.	1.0263957789045535
Initially the swelling occured intermittently, but after 2 years it was permanent and progressive markedly limiting her visual fields.	1.03290608844843
Neither laboratory findings nor imaging procedures provided any firm evidence of an underlying cardiac, renal or endocrinological disease.	0.9817155919479367
There was no suggestion of a storage disease.	0.8733225111181381
Skin biopsy showed foam cells and granulomatous inflammation, so the patient was tentatively diagnosed as having a monosymptomatic Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome.	1.0787765639296378
Eyelid surgery was performed to improve her visual fields.	0.970593144664182
Treatment with clofazimine 100 mg daily was initiated.	0.663873298526061
Regular follow-up visits over 7 months revealed no evidence of recurrence.	0.8232774959307657
The patient died a sudden cardiac death a few months later.	1.1570566753755684
The relatives refused an autopsy.	0.48592985315125875
The definite cause of her facial swelling remains unclear as we discuss the differential diagnostic possibilities.	0.9899914605128667
An 81-year-old patient had prolonged competitive neuromuscular blockade with train-of-four ratios of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively, after two successive anaesthesia procedures (enflurane-N2O/O2; vecuronium-succinylcholine-sequence) for transurethral prostate resection.	1.168693306445062
Although antagonism with neostigmine was promptly successful after the first, 65-min period of anaesthesia (1.5 mg vecuronium for precurarization, 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation, 3 mg vecuronium), repetitive and chronologically staggered administration of neostigmine after the second, 30-min period of anaesthesia (1 mg vecuronium for precurarization, 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation) had hardly any effect, so that the patient had to be ventilated mechanically for a total of 4.5 h. Laboratory analysis revealed homozygous, atypical, plasma cholinesterase (790 U/l; dibucaine number 23; genotype E<![CDATA[|lefbop|a<![CDATA[|clobop||opnbop|1<![CDATA[|clobop|E<![CDATA[|lefbop|a<![CDATA[|clobop||opnbop|1<![CDATA[|clobop|).	0.968215627761951
This retrospectively confirmed a succinylcholine-induced phase II block in both instances, as had already been suspected following the second anaesthetic procedure.	1.0173080296007522
The degree of block transformation, and thus the available time, are decisive in explaining the diverse effects of antagonism here.	1.1747262877233804
It must be assumed that a complete phase II block developed after the first succinylcholine exposure owing to the longer duration of anaesthesia; the purely competitive component (train-of-four ratio 0.1) was easily antagonized by neostigmine.	1.1424494870484916
At the time of the attempted antagonism after the second, shorter period of anaesthesia, however, block transformation was still incomplete (train-of-four ratio 0.5).	1.064081269005605
The administration of neostigmine therefore rather intensified the depolarization segment of the mixed block, so that repeated attempts at antagonism then inhibited any further block transformation.	0.8912881335242211
The Ph1-negative groups of chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPD) are described, and histopathological criteria that distinguish them from each other are given.	1.0327833099396035
These are based upon observations in primary biopsies from 2,331 patients with CMPDs among a total of 34,160 patients referred between 1 January 1989 and 30 June 1994 to the Bone Marrow Registry.	1.1023344162500013
These cases of CMPD break down into the main groups as follows: CML 23.2 %, megakaryocytic myelosis consistent with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia 22.3 %, essential thrombocythemia 22.1 %, and polycythemia vera 20.4 %; 12.0 % of cases were unclassifiable.	1.1643379455933112
Histological progress in each group is characterized by (1) increasing number and pleomorphy of megakaryocytes, (2) increasing fibrosis, and (3) excess of blasts.	1.0928609404308123
These three features can be observed in diagnostic biopsies before any therapy.	0.9323183557531889
Therefore, it is recommended that such alterations be reported semiquantitatively.	1.1455698865124024
A staging system with four stages from 0 to 3 for each of the three features is introduced.	1.1099345718331888
Its application allows staging for the individual patient on the basis of diagnostic biop-sies.	0.9662201898532676
Chondral and osteochondral lesions as well as bone bruises of the ankle are caused in the most cases by trauma and are localized almost exclusively at the talus.	1.1861219669283112
For diagnosis, operative management and follow up, magnetic resonance imaging was useful, which can be further improved by application of intravenous or intraarticullar contrast enhancement (Gadolinium).	1.0106583079115452
In adults operative therapy is favored.	0.6769142189801979
Due to new techniques, arthroscopy became an important alternative to arthrotomy.	0.9438530050251442
According to the stage of the disease, drilling or curettage, removal or fixation of the fragment, autologous bone transplantation or osteochondral graft can be performed.	0.9528989077630701
All procedures can be managed arthroscopically.	0.8610237455870735
General Psychotherapy isn't a new type of therapy, but it could be a paradigmatic model for all empirically-oriented psychotherapists.	1.0745633522158038
The contents of this model are defined.	0.8993139728692169
Arguments and reasons are put forward as to why the practice of psychotherapy should be guided by empirically based procedure rules instead of by therapy methods.	0.8293865817070206
The procedure rules should be joined together by a theoretical conception of psychological functioning, from which their relative significance and prescription conditions can be derived.	0.9223905390483135
A consistency-theory based model of psychological functioning is sketched, from which conclusions can be drawn about the emergence and maintenance of psychological disorders on the one hand and the prescription conditions of different therapeutic procedures on the other.	1.037312510951185
The advantages of this model in view of a general psychotherapy are discussed.	1.1864610739558363
In the Federal Republic of Germany, no data existed regarding the frequency of open heart surgery for excision of cardiac neoplasms.	1.0221176066172182
Therefore, a standard questionnaire concerning heart tumors was sent to all 77 German heart centers performing cardiac surgery.	1.0559740968304463
Although induction chemotherapy administered prior to local therapy produces encouraging initial response rates in head and neck cancer, randomized studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in survival rates.	1.0625505091740906
All randomized studies included only patients with advanced stage III and IV disease.	1.0423770610289138
In our opinion, this is the main reason for the low rate of complete responses demonstrated in the randomized trials (maximum 18%).	1.055217837422928
estimate that a 40%-50% complete response rate is necessary before improved survival rates are seen.	1.1101211044629797
To date, such complete response rates with induction chemotherapy have only been attainable in resectable T2-T3, N0-N2 disease.	1.0581398702921352
Therefore, we initiated a prospective randomized trial including only patients with the mentioned disease stages.	1.2699705073436502
Patients (pts) were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy with three cycles of carboplatin/5-FU prior to surgery and radiotherapy (arm A, 70 pts) or standard treatment with surgery and radiotherapy (arm B, 74 pts).	1.1544787193683763
Patients were classified according to primary tumour site and neck disease.	0.9566839006224145
The observed remission rate after chemotherapy confirmed the primary estimated rate for this subgroup of patients with head and neck cancer (CR: 43%, PR: 37%, NR: 15%, PD: 5%).	1.1958159040892706
After a follow-up of 12-96 months overall survival was 58% in arm A and 45% in arm B (n.s.).	1.1708344334993093
Disease-free survival in arm A (61%) is statistically significantly better than in arm B (43%, P=0.03).	1.2533746632755827
Therefore, we recommend further controlled trials to investigate the role of induction chemotherapy in patients with primary resectable carcinomas of the oral cavity and tonsils and stage T2-T3 and N0-N2 disease prior to surgery.	1.1490902256632847
Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery has evolved as a reliable method to perform left internal mammary artery (LIMA) bypass surgery to the LAD.	1.0681476247728106
This novel technique represents a synthesis of known approaches to coronary surgery using sternotomy without extracorporeal circulation and limited access techniques in general thoracic surgery.	0.8843955444254447
Applying specially designed tools for both harvesting the internal mammary artery and mechanically stabilizing the anterior surface of the heart during anastomosis, this approach is gaining widespread acceptance.	1.0616119910798552
A steadily growing number of patients with proximal LAD lesions are submitted to cardiac surgery and the procedure is performed with increasing success rates, now approaching 98% short term patency.	1.0966066538288077
In a specific series war injuries in the trochanteric region were characterized; a limited methodological approach magnified the problem.	0.9528119786441455
Our experience and the treatment results (debridement, drainage and external fixation) are presented.	1.0526187312252913
The methodology, complications and final results are also given for 15 patients.	0.9918744923673288
Consolidation was achieved in primary external fixation without additional procedures such as spongioplasty or internal fixation conversion methods.	0.873687164708812
The time to consolidation without complications was 28.6 weeks (24-36) and with complications (deep infections, chronic osteomyelitis) 40.8 weeks (28-68).	1.1956849109310466
In total, there was one poor result with angulation, shortening of the extremity and chronic intermittent fistulation.	1.1931534411762958
The average follow-up was 22.7 months (1-34 months).	1.1820201902219796
Our personal experience and the results speak on behalf of external fixation.	0.9186830219687313
Under war conditions, primary fixation ensures the best late anatomical and functional results.	0.8285505483291159
Minimal osteosynthesis improves the final outcome if the rules of application and the indications for selection are adhered to strictly.	0.8698933843214101
Introduction of the computed tomography index CTDI and the multiple scan average dose (MSAD) has led to standardization of the dose description in CT examinations.	0.9258727897565939
Despite the use of these dose parameters, many different dosages are reported in the literature for different CT methods.	1.1704894190545447
In addition, there is still a wide range of radiation dosimetry results reported for conventional CT, helical CT, and HRCT used in chest examinations.	1.1642154354673138
The variations in dosage are mainly due to differences in factors affecting the dose, i. e. beam geometry, beam quality, scanner geometry ("generation"), and operating parameters.	1.0316006484354427
In addition, CT dosimetry instrumentation and methodology make a contribution to dosages.	1.1110977779106153
Recent studies calculating differences in factors affecting dosage and CT dosimetry and using similar operating parameters, show similar results in CT dosimetry for conventional and helical CT. On the other hand, dosages for HRCT were greatly reduced.	0.9537568717636813
This was mainly caused by narrow beam collimation and increasing section spacing.	0.6982360852212411
Central pulmonary embolism represents one of the most threatening complications in surgical patients.	0.9961257906843114
In most cases deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities is the source of emboli.	0.9151182917260752
Despite the introduction of hypocoagulative drugs in standard surgical concepts the incidence of deep vein thrombosis remains about 10 % in trauma patients.	1.1009555637027173
Estimated numbers of unknown cases of pulmonary embolism are supposed to be rather high too.	1.0280734849001034
In haemodynamically symptomatic pulmonary embolism events and especially when the patient has to be reanimated, mortality rates of up to 93 % are reported in literature.	1.217280647034458
After introduction of the heart- and lung-machine in the surgical concept of therapy, survival rates have increased significantly.	1.2324910111424725
We report on three cases of successful surgical embolectomy after CPR.	1.1619847227884688
In a review of literature current concepts of treatment in central pulmonary embolism are discussed.	1.1635613995831955
Imaging of tumors of the pancreas may have a series of significant implications for surgical decision making.	0.9989072348486512
First of all verification and localization of a suspected tumor is crucial.	0.8747671455125647
Later on, accurate staging of local tumor extent and of distant metastases is necessary for evaluating the indications for surgical intervention.	0.9977506352190408
If histologic proof of malignancy of a pancreatic lesion is needed, different imaging techniques can be used for percutaneous biopsy of the tumor.	1.0741037080638411
Finally imaging is required in patients with a pancreatic tumor if an obstruction of the common bile duct is treated with palliative intent by endoscopy or transhepatic intervention.	1.0105938480617882
A rational and efficient selection from all the imaging techniques currently available requires a clear-cut definition of what is needed for surgical decision making in each individual case.	0.9218650766404608
Thereby one has to take into account whether the tumor arises from the exocrine or from the endocrine tissue of the pancreas.	0.9793878371725926
In spite of the importance of skin diseases in Africa south of the Sahara, dermatology is insufficiently represented within the established primary health care systems.	0.9756620413014875
Aim of this study was to find out whether an integrated dermatology project could reduce the prevalence of dermatoses.	0.9100373023309368
Magnetic resonance imaging has shown to be a sensitive method for diagnostics of the red bone marrow, the composition of which changes physiologically and during pathological processes.	1.1233215270864256
However, the interpretation of MRI in patients with disorders of the red bone marrow is very difficult.	1.0951497835283956
The aim of this study was the characterization of the proton spectrum of healthy bone marrow and its age- and sex-dependent changes to obtain a data basis for measurements in patients.	1.1100165570800489
We report a case of a 26-year-old patient, a tilelayer by profession, with a history of a fall from a height of 5 meters with blunt thoracic injury and resultant left atrial rupture.	1.0519026722806397
The emergency doctor found at the site of accident a deeply comatose patient (Glasgow Coma Scale 3 points) with no recordable blood pressure.	0.9755329166150987
After two hours of resuscitation at the site of accident and at the closest emergency traumatology unit a marginal blood pressure was seen.	0.9868200040321523
With a suspicion of a closed ascending aortic rupture the patient was transferred to the nearest cardiothoracic surgical unit.	0.8826548432210413
During transfer, the patient had a cardiac standstill with asystole and was further reanimated and resuscitated.	1.05342678638246
On arrival the patient was transferred to the operation theatre immediately and after femoro-femoral cannulation was supported by a heart-lung-machine circulation.	1.0027149422768253
Through an optimal exposition the internal thoracic organs were inspected in detail and the rupture of the left atrium was identified and treated.	1.0424645738896292
The heart was effectively emptied and with deep hypothermia with a reduction of oxygen consumption by all organs especially the brain was taken care of.	0.9477606870449715
