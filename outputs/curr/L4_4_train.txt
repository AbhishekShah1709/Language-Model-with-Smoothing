Precision of osteodensitometric measurements using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) depends on various known factors, such as positioning, aortic calcification or vertebral fractures.	0.43866963893698113
The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of various diseases or bone density on the reproducibility of measurements in the lumbar spine and the proximal femur.	0.7735790569736325
Measurements in the LWS p.a., LWS lat.	0.41596716386910065
and at Ward's triangle were made in a total of 100 patients.	0.4841765112358499
The subjects were repositioned between measurements.	0.25285549038340643
In order to be able to determine the influence of various diseases, four groups of 25 patients each were formed: three with the diagnosis osteoarthrosis, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis and one control group.	0.6774656031416462
The mean percentual difference and coefficient of variation were calculated as the measure for reproducibility.	0.3888187269063832
Mean percentual differences of 0.18 to 2.6% were found in the four groups at the three measurements sites.	0.9256066653924662
After calculation of coefficient of variation, a value between 1.2 and 2.7% was found for LWS p.a., between 7.1 and 15.7% for LWS lat.	0.9271542429065944
and between 4.1 and 9.9% at Ward's triangle.	0.8160282989983767
It was also conspicuous that the difference in coefficient of variation in osteoporosis patients was nearly double that in the control group in all measured areas.	0.5917485221743964
Conclusion: Lateral lumbar spinal measurements using DEXA cannot presently be recommended.	0.30795887820986906
measurements and, with limitations, measurements at Ward's triangle have good precision and could be used for course documentation of bone density.	0.5740769156067272
Background: We compared the endothelial protective function of two hyaluronic acid viscoelastics (Healon GV, Provisc) of different molecular weight and viscosity during phakoemulsification in high-risk eyes.	0.6180576532913186
Diseases of the peripheral nervous system occur in up to 50% of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).	0.572988031984909
In early stages of the infection, Guillain-Barré syndrome or a spontaneously remitting mononeuropathy can occur.	0.4529776488204821
The most frequent occurrence is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy associated with HIV, which can only be treated symptomatically.	0.7145075320643914
The most important differential diagnosis is a drug-induced polyneuropathy under antiretroviral therapy with the nucleoside analogues DDI, DDC, or D4T.	0.6441377710488773
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is less common and can be treated with immunoglobulins or corticosteroids.	0.6069017261525634
Very rare are steroid-responsive neuropathies with necrotizing vasculitis or in diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome (DILS).	0.3316968571219492
In the AIDS stage, polyradiculitis can occur due to opportunistic infections - most often with cytomegalovirus (CMV) or M. tuberculosis - or polyradiculopathies due to lymphomatous meningiosis.	0.6365932241767335
Mononeuritis multiplex is rarely seen in disseminated CMV infection.	0.34255972605906815
Myopathies can occur in all stages of HIV infection; their frequency is about 1%.	0.6022313475855235
Primary polymyositis associated with HIV, which can be treated with corticosteroids or immunoglobulin, must be distinguished from myopathy induced by azidothymidine.	0.60292609168101
Other forms of myopathy are very rare.	0.44216851880839214
54 patients, who had been explored at the end of their treatment including a psychosomatic approach in a medical department of a general hospital, were interviewed again in their homes three months later.	0.7398634941265575
Contentment with treatment was high in the inpatient and outpatient setting, the ill felt only moderately stressed by their illnesses, showed an adaptive constellation of coping styles and were surprisingly well adapted.	0.5267612986415676
The comparison between the two measures showed a less favourable view of the patients three months after discharge from hospital at a quarter of the tested parameters, the variability was high in the scales, that were used.	0.804807884517284
Explanations for these results are discussed.	0.6512664743749061
At a long term perspective coping with illness may be improved especially by interventions of the family doctors.	0.5686797897446313
Health care costs have risen considerably since 1970 in all industrialized countries.	0.3996489034383253
This has several causes: changes in demographic structure, the large number of physicians, increased personnel needs resulting from generous vacation and special leave privileges, wage increases and - last but not least - medical progress.	0.5563537169984359
Advances in medical technology are often regarded as one of the main reasons for spiralling costs in health care.	0.5936029512297216
Careful analyses reveal, however, that the high costs of imaging services are due to conventional radiography rather than to high-technology (CT, MR) imaging.	0.6684027105896811
The legitimate demands for cost reduction have to be met with improved cost efficiency while optimal quality standards must also be maintained.	0.4323784865511174
Relevant suggestions, such as generally accepted examination strategies, should be realized with the help of the scientific societies.	0.47980694738139995
Background: Main features of the Coffin-Siris syndrome are mental retardation and absent or hypoplastic nails of the fifth fingers and toes.	0.400870872945256
Further symptoms are wide mouth with prominent lips, sparse scalp hair, and hypertrichosis.	0.41811130820761216
We report on two premature infants who had completed 25 and 29 weeks of gestation and who developed unilateral interstitial pulmonary emphysema.	0.6064742448855593
In both cases massive mediastinal displacement developed with compression and total atelectasis of the contralateral lung.	0.5402752327620395
By selective intubation of the respective main bronchus, complete ventilation of the collapsed lungs and sufficient gas exchange was achieved.	0.5115641748172346
After 3 days (case 1) and after 6 days) case 2), the unilateral emphysema receded and, subsequently, bilateral respiration was possible without relapse.	0.7191758515439493
6 and respectively 11 days after selective intubation, extubation was performed.	0.40949140925801303

Patient with extensive keratosis palmoplantaris maculosa seu papulosa (Davies-Colley) presented with multiple cutaneous horns.	0.36348747501975787
The clinical picture, the histology, the electro microscopic examination, the negative tumor screening and the viral classification in the tissue allowed the differentiation from other palmoplantar keratoses.	0.7394179205130013
The patient was treated successfully using a combination of acitretin with physical and chemical measures.	0.6359494499176378
Epidemiologic studies have shown that trace concentrations of inhalation anaesthetics polluting the air of operating theatres could have deleterious effects on the personnel's health.	0.42310285562780103
Nitrous oxide (N2O) oxidises vitamin B12 and thus decreases DNA production by inactivation of methionine synthase.	0.3159726121650706
Therefore, the United States and most European health authorities recommend threshold values to protect against potential health risks.	0.4591300991066832
These values range from 25 to 100 ppm, expressed as time-weighted averages (TWA).	0.41846218757921866
There is a lack of data concerning measurements of trace concentrations under defined conditions.	0.48649357955735406
The aim of this study was to quantify levels of N2O in a recovery room (RR) with an air conditioning system.	0.6059858541714664
The blood loss during the acute period after complex pelvic trauma is finally responsible for the high mortality associated with this specific type of injury.	0.7387028401765483
Several protocols have been published for optimized management, but up to now comparable data are not available as no exact definitions exist judging the severty of trauma and blood loss.	0.698527126944339
As part of a prospective study 19 patients after unstable pelvic injuries with unstable circulation underwent emergency stabilization by the pelvic C-clamp.	0.6106224637597574
Beside standard clinical parameter the initial hemoglobin value was converted into a "bloodvolume equivalent".	0.42819905621495424
18 of the 19 patients had an injury severety according to group III and IV of the Hannover Polytrauma Score (PTS).	0.5997812012380813
Concommitant abdominal injuries were seen in 12 cases (23 injuries), concommitant urological injuries in 12 cases (14 injuries).	0.64239773768511
In 13 cases the pelvis was the major source of bleeding in 9 cases an additional intraabdominal hemorrhage was observed.	0.5538843643192493
11 patients died due to sequelae of their injury, 8 patients survived.	0.5900607134802064
Although the initial blood loss was comparable both in the group of the deceased patients and the survivors, a 44% higher subsequent blood substitution (= 10 089 ml) was observed in the nonsurvivor group.	0.8467533129818978
In conclusion the data proofed that early control of hemorrhage is fundamental for the prognoses after complex pelvic trauma.	0.4283484354083066
The estimation of the blood loss may help in indicating agressive emergency procedures like emergency stabilisation, pelvic clamps, surgical exploration and tamponade.	0.6693841449093725
This calculation may be a basis for a more detailed analyses of this devastating injury and judging the benefit of different management protocols.	0.6142094886786962
In contrast to childhood intussusception, the clinical signs of intussusception in adults are nonspecific.	0.7589355152654408
Generally organic alterations of the small bowel cause intussusception in adults.	0.552575986502189
In this case report on a retrograde jejunojejunal intussusception in a 61-year-old male, following removal of an intraoperatively placed intestinal tube for ileus therapy, the clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods and therapy for intussusception are described.	0.703545584699126
Sonography is not only the diagnostic tool of choice in childs, but also led to the correct diagnosis in this case.	0.976556953552624
In contrast to childhood intussusception, operative treatment is preferred in adults.	0.5713299189227073
The term "frontal lobe syndrome" comprises a variety of different clinical syndromes produced by focal lesions involving the prefrontal cortex.	0.42690875867746164
However, similar syndromes can be observed after lesions involving subcortical structures connected with the prefrontal cortex in neuronal networks.	0.5565837559506943
With respect to the different clinical pictures and underlying brain lesions, prefrontal lobe dysfunction may be divided into a disorganized type, caused by lesion of the dorsolateral prefrontal lobe and its connections, a disinhibited type that can be observed following lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex, and an apathetic type following lesions affecting the functional balance between the cingulum and the supplementary motor area.	0.6129150088063311
As intracerebral lesions are rarely limited to the brain regions described, in the majority of patients various degrees of behavioural dysfunction can be observed.	0.6800467741404261
The case reports of four patients illustrating the three major prefrontal syndroms following severe head injury (n=2) or cerebrovascular disease (n=2) are presented and diagnostic implications as well as possible treatment strategies are discussed.	0.7050681101408974
The measures taken in intensive care medicine are rated differently by the patients, their family, and personnel.	0.69296993996146
A lack of understanding for intensive care therapy can lead to a negative attitude towards intensive care medicine, which in turn makes an impression on public opinion, and disturbs the reputation of the co-workers in intensive care medicine.	0.6754865485228319
To form an objective view, we carried out a survey of 40 co-workers (11 physicians, 23 from the nursing staff, and 6 ancillary personnel) regarding the medical technology, the environment in the unit, general medical questions, and the extent of intensive care therapy.	0.8093557155654268
The length of employment in the intensive care unit ranged from 1-240 months (median 18 months), the ages ranged from 21 to 53 years (median 30 years).	0.7353874891004821
Of those questioned 73%  found intensive care medicine in its current form to be purposeful: 100% of the physicians and only 57% of the nursing staff were of this opinion.	0.7596237042794004
Only 9% of the physicians believed the equipment to be fear-inducing for the patients; in contrast, 61% of the nursing staff believed this to be true.	0.7652523778079543
The noise level was rated as very disturbing by 65% of the nursing staff and 45% of the physicians.	0.6728275954252294
Only 22% of the nursing staff believed that the patients felt comfortable and protected on the intensive care unit; 48% felt that they were unhappy or even miserable.	0.5925912701609577
Of the physicians 46% believed that the patients were comfortable.	0.7877207556329773
Of the nursing staff 100% were of the opinion that for the deceased patients, organ substitution therapy had continued too long.	0.666886369005942
On the other hand, only 45% of the residents shared this opinion.	0.5787304841039077
The medical staff rated the intensive care measures as purposeful, less disturbing for the patients and more effective than did the nursing staff.	0.7310224870806797
In many cases, the nursing staff as a group exhibited a contrary and negative opinion.	0.6774576642658595
This could possibly be caused by insecurity, lack of information and lack of successful experiences.	0.4582509637079208
Next to patient outcome, the competent explanation and information regarding the disease and prognosis and the recurrent communication within the intensive care team, with respect to diagnostic and therapeutic measures are the deciding factors in the opinion formation regarding intensive care medicine.	0.7129537435913204
In this pilot study 12 patients with moderate to severe atopic eczema were treated with 2 million IU interferon alpha 2a (Roferon A) three times weekly for 8 weeks and followed up for a further 10 weeks: 2 patients showed clear and 9 a slight to moderate reduction of their skin lesions; 1 patient got worse.	0.6694746157732198
Pruritus did not decrease and even increased in a few patients, and IgE levels showed no change during and after treatment.	0.7090353182844867
All patients noted mild, transient, flu-like symptoms.	0.38946875894397504
The efficacy of interferon alpha in the present therapeutic design for the treatment of atopic eczema must thus be classified as only moderate.	0.583835411385359
Shock secondary to sepsis is a serious common disease with a substantial mortality.	0.5201713558647005
Coagulation abnormalities, ranging from a rapid fulminant state of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) to a slight elevation in the level of fibrin(ogen) degradation products, are well recognized in patients with bacterial septicemia.	0.5897995119222103
Therefore, the inhibition of the activated coagulation is one of the first therapeutic steps.	0.7211832185441212
We investigated 30 intensive care patients with septic disease and comparable signs of abnomalities in coagulation at the beginning.	0.544907213174603
Fifteen patients were treated with 1.5-5 E/kg body weight (Low dose group), the others received 8-15 E/kg (high dose group).	0.8215691801796118
Our study demonstrated a significant stronger and faster decline of coagulation parameters - such as d-dimer, TAT and PTF 1 + 2 - in the High dose group without any bleeding disorder.	0.6813905898623703
Thus, we support in cases of coagulation disease except fulminant ones the high dose therapy with LMWH as shown above.	0.5712371124679838
Background: Laparoscopic techniques are currently used for curative resection of colorectal cancer although long-term results from controlled clinical trials are not available yet that prove laparoscopic procedures are adequate.	0.7228249060841683
Methods: All patients who underwent a curative resection of a colorectal tumor from 1995 to 1997 were included in a prospective cohort study to evaluate the short- and long-term results.	0.9035456436454525
Results: Laparoscopic colorectal resections were accomplished in 68 patients.	0.45988369749787683
In only 3 patients was an adenoma (stage 0) found, and 10 patients had multiple liver metastases at the time of palliative resection.	0.718861384899016
An oncological resection was performed in 55 patients.	0.5545175611008692
The average age was 62.8  +/-  14.6 years (29 female and 26 male patients).	0.8106656979789824
Eleven right colectomies, 1 left colectomy, 21 sigmoid resections, 16 proctosigmoidectomies and 6 abdominoperineal resections were carried out.	0.5191112644647277
Two patients (3.6 %) were lost during follow-up.	0.7944444036787466
The median follow-up was 27.1 months (range 9.1-45.1 months).	0.9491409551229469
No port-site metastases were found.	0.3064292083866381
Two patients who are still alive after sigmoid resection suffered from a recurrence.	0.6691596972921504
The first patient underwent only limited lymphadenectomy because of synchronous malignant lymphoma.	0.37958802491915383
The second patient developed bilateral lung metastases.	0.3858620858180661
Only one patient died during the follow-up period because of myocardial infarction.	0.7917668344942846
Conclusion: Although the follow-up is short, it seems that the recurrence rate is low.	0.8388706941243484
Controlled multicenter clinical trials are currently performed to evaluate whether laparoscopic surgery is really adequate to treat colorectal cancer.	0.6322754183274952
The authors report a tracheal rupture in a 34-year-old patient who was primarily intubated following generalised seizures and loss of consciousness (Rüsch endotracheal tube).	0.5728366658738677
Some hours later, she developed high ventilatory airway pressures and subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema were noted.	0.4389403760385909
Reintubation with a high-volume, low-pressure endotracheal tube was planned when it was noted that the ballon of the Rüsch tube was grossly overinflated.	0.65132165822268
Endotracheal tube cuff pressure was measured and found to be greater than 120 cm H2O (the maximum measurement possible with the manometer).	0.6313447479955543
The diagnosis of tracheal rupture was confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy.	0.5074790106271514
The patient immediately underwent a throacotomy and a 3-cm tear of the pars membranacea of the trachea was sutured with a dural patch.	0.5476035318407286
To maintain low airway pressures post-operatively, she remained sedated for 2 days and received a muscle relaxant to permit pressure-controlled ventilation.	0.5519720780853107
In this case, it can be concluded that excessive inflation of the endotracheal tube cuff resulted in the tracheal rupture.	0.6563679398307471
Other possible causes and results of tracheal rupture are discussed.	0.47596877731477477
Urinary tract infections are the most frequent nosocomial infections, accounting for about 40% of all nosocomial infections.	0.8479179305823495
In most cases these infections are associated with indwelling urinary catheters.	0.4742285654886916
The guideline from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, USA) for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections, as the most important evidence-based guideline worldwide, was published in 1981 and has not been updated so far.	0.6874368147748169
Evidence-based national guidelines are not available in Germany.	0.5652633853369861
We have, therefore, performed a literature search for randomized, controlled studies on the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (Medline, Cochrane Library, reference text books) published since 1981.	0.5235478191410398
Fifty studies meeting our inclusion criteria were identified.	0.21857145078361254
Substantial new findings have been published on alternatives to urethral catheters and new catheter materials.	0.5052944325767098
Based upon the CDC guideline, whose principles are still valid, updated guidelines for the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections have been developed by the National Reference Center for Hospital Hygiene.	0.6188119215914698
Chronic hypoperfusion of the hypogastric arteries due to aortoiliac surgery leads to a complex of symptoms well known as Lerich's syndome.	0.43641290473269756
In contrast, acute ischemia of the pelvic arterial tree leads to lethal complications [2, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13].	0.7832133619890238
Acute interruption of the hypogastric perfusion mainly occurs after aortoiliac surgery or after selective transcatheter embolisation of the internal iliac artery for control of pelvic bleeding [1, 8].	0.578384586744205
Several complications may occur after total occlusion: urinary bladder necrosis [6], left colon ischemia, spinal cord ischemia [10], nerve palsy, necrosis of the rectum and gluteal musculature [2, 11-13].	0.6022560277115226
Despite adequate therapy, mortality is over 70% [2].	0.7823054881447495
We report the case of a 66-year-old patient who survived after acute occlusion of the iliac arteries with gluteal necrosis following replacement of the infrarenal aorta with an aortobiiliacal graft.	0.5764792384969964
As demonstrated in 44 allogeneic sibling (34 HLA identical, 10 HLA mismatched at 1-3 loci) and 6 unrelated (1 HLA-identical, 5 mismatched at 1-3 loci) cord blood (CB) transplantations CB has been shown to be a rich source of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.	0.6817942252588097
Therefore, a scientific pilot project in order to evaluate HLA class I and II typed cord blood samples for unrelated transplantation was initiated.	0.5834705371182062
Hitherto 372 CB samples: mean volume 79 +/-  5x108, were collected from the umbilical cord vein immediately after vaginal full term delivery (n=302) or ceasarean section (n=70) and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen.	0.5580013425246948
Methods for HLA-typing by serology for HLA-class I and II from minimal cell amounts were adjusted that only 1.5 ml of the whole CB was needed for both the HLA-class I and II typing by serology (1 ml) and DNA-typing for HLA-class II (0.5 ml).	0.7490017783790038
Only 3.5 additional ml of the CB were required for the AB0 typing, control of sterility, determination of progenitor cells by colony forming assays and CD34 and the analysis of contaminating maternal cells by simultaneous immunophenotypic and genotypic analysis of interphase cells and the PCR using sequence-specific priming (PCR-SSP) for the non-inherited maternal allel.	0.5239664987204703
Mother'sera have been tested for HBsAg, anti-HCV, -HAV, -HIV-1-2, -EBV, -VCA, -HTLVI-II, -CMV, Toxoplasmosis and Syphilis.	0.9853216454576236
Nonepithelial malignant tumors of the pancreas are extremely rare neoplasms with a frequency of ~0,6%.	0.5878780484918927
They are always explored because of a suspected diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma.	0.6573620879820581
Amongst the more than 600 primary pancreatic neoplasms in our pancreatic tumor archive only 5 neoplasms were of nonepithelial origin (one was a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor [MPNST], one a leiomyosarcoma, one a malignant mesothelioma, and two were peripheral neuroectodermal tumors [PNET].	0.6072709148362768
The differential diagnosis includes secondary infiltration of the pancreas by mesenchymal tumors of the retroperitoneum, undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma and, especially in the case of PNET, malignant lymphoma.	0.7271884931411093
Preoperative chemotherapy and down-staging can improve the operability and  prognosis, especially in PNET.	0.585718217991217
In patients with renal or hepatic failure, the pharmacokinetics of opioids may be affected in several ways, leading to the necessity to correct the dose.	0.6721334288737612
The liver is the major site for biotransformation of most opioids.	0.5096595530407487
The major metabolic pathway is oxidation.	0.24078476876934993
Exceptions to this are morphine and buprenorphine, which undergo primarily glucuronidation, and remifentanil which is cleared by esther hydrolysis.	0.5413003242240824
The hydrophilic metabolites are predominantly excreted by the kidneys and may accumulate in patients with renal insufficiency.	0.4797221848799295
Some metabolites such as morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) or normeperidine are active opioid agonists.	0.46104608801766467
With high concentrations they may cause narcotic effects or respiratory depression.	0.3823549957585519
In addition, special risks are known for normepridine that has been shown to exert neurotoxic effects with the risk of seizures.	0.5518929824761385
Few cases of respiratory depression following the administration of codeine, dihydrocodeine and tramdol have been reported.	0.4898961117352358
The elimination half-life of these drugs was prolonged.	0.6260833297830298
Lastly, the disposition of methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl, sufentanyl and remifentanil appears to be unaffected in renal failure.	0.49173795981851076
Backgrounds: Aim of this study was to validate a modification of adults' 13C-urea breath test for children in diagnosis of an infection with Helicobacter pylori.	0.5436018971870142
Methods: In 30 asymptomatic children results of the breath test were compared with results of an ELISA test specific for Helicobacter pylori.	0.6887044960448546
In 10 symptomatic children the breath test result was compared with histological results of gastric mucosa.	0.5400823636412801
Cold orange juice was tested by ultrasonic assessment to be suitable as a test meal.	0.5203710925522153
Results: With the serological or histological result as reference method, the cut-off value for children (delta value = 5 permil) has shown a sensitivity/specificity of 70 %/95 % or 100 %/100 % respectively.	0.8020480126401484
Cold orange juice meets the criteria of a test meal by inhibiting the gastric emptying for the duration of the breath test significantly.	0.5409488990348889
30 minutes after 13C-urea ingestion has been the optimal point of time for the second breath sample collection.	0.5350593064616445
Conclusion: Our modification of the 13C-urea breath test for children is suitable to prove an Helicobacter pylori infection.	0.47736288396964577
This review summarizes some aspects of German pediatrics as it developed after world war II.	0.5190144983732532
Having lost its touch with international pediatrics regained its high standard during the late forties and fifties and now develops in concordance with the changing needs and the advances of pediatrics in a highly industialoized nation.	0.3575528053918963
As in other countries, the practice and structure of pediatrics have been influenced by changes in social attidudes and expectations, and by economic restrictions.	0.6252219112783528
National specifics are the high number of practicing pediatric population and emphasis on a highly structured and formalized preventive care program under a public health plan.	0.37428085990404664
The need for critical evaluation of this program is emphasized as is the need for better communication among subspecialties.	0.5220648207457739
Aim of this study was to isolate T lymphocytes from atheromatous plaques and to determine they respond to Chlamydia antigens.	0.46209384420851696
In recent years, mumps orchitis has become a rarely reported disease.	0.5893069662715098
However, since October 1994 a clear increase in the incidence of this disease has been observed.	0.7936324169115849
At four hospitals in the Saarland, Germany, 45 cases of mumps orchitis in adolescents and adults were diagnosed in this period.	0.5609187066407736
In addition to the case history and clinical findings, the diagnosis was confirmed by an increased IgM titer.	0.9313669107656398
None of the patients had been previously vaccinated.	1.0676592486426417
The main reason for this was a lack of parental knowledge of the necessity for this vaccination, one which has almost no side effects.	0.6344004108965199
The goal of this study is to describe the disease, present our own results, and indicate the need for vaccination.	0.7669447338629044
In addition to providing information, a further aim of the study is to increase the motivation of adolescents and adults for vaccination.	0.8934264800345857
Although many treatments for mumps have been published in recent years, the most successful therapy is still prophylactic vaccination.	0.7725383611381855
Neurofibromas, café au lait macules and freckles in the axillary or inguinal regions are common manifestations of von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (NF-1).	0.37249820503008335
Less known is the simultaneous appearance of dermal melanocytic naevi.	0.3257909720104543
We describe the case of a 21-year-old Vietnamese woman who showed generalized, multiple neurofibromas, a solitary plexiform neurofibroma in the left gluteal region and Lisch nodules.	0.6427922525173939
In addition, there were several large grey-blue macules histologically characterized by fusiform pigment-bearing cells in the dermis, which we diagnosed as persistent aberrant mongolian spots.	0.627366985079357
In the right zygomatic region she presented a grey-blue, hair-bearing macule, which we saw as a variant of Ota's naevus.	0.597210976007018
A genetic background for this coincidence of a systemic with a local phakomatosis can be supposed, as both Schwann's cells and melanocytes are derived from the neural crest.	0.5345538300157145
Such pathologic rearrangement in the embryogenesis of the cellular elements could be important for the pathogenesis of NF-1 and dermal melanocytic nevi.	0.567214835255959
Infectious agents may directly or indirectly (through the response of the host's immune system) modulate the growth of vascular cells.	0.5049928189161803
Local and/or systemic increase of cytokines could influence the extent of (re-)stenosis in the vascular tree.	0.6793273074488383
Further studies in this field may identify patients at a high risk for atherogenesis and restenosis.	0.6804845149035688
Their results should be helpful in treating restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions.	0.4172291030611929
Besides other reasons, cost containments mandate the rational use of preoperative screening tests which should be adapted to the risk of the individual patient.	0.6657559461462236
Since the perioperative cardiac risk increases with age, elderly patients in particular require a thorough evaluation of their perioperative risk.	0.5088798315679758
Routine ECG, however, is not indicated in patients under 45 years of age who do not present with signs or history of preexisting cardiac diseases but should be performed on a routine basis in all patients over 45 years of age.	0.684080902791375
The validity of an ergometer test as a preoperative indicator of myocardial ischemia is limited due to a high incidence of false negative results.	0.5811629370320839
By preoperative routine chest radiography previously unknown findings are only detected in a small number of patients; thus, in patients of ASA-risk groups I-II younger than 74 years of age routine chest-x-ray cannot be justified.	0.7168461490648355
In patients whose perioperative cardiac risk as assessed clinically and by ECG is ambiguous, dipyridamole-thallium-myocardial scintigraphy (DTMS) and dobutamine-stress-echocardiography may contribute valuable information regarding the prediction of perioperative adverse cardiac events.	0.5178892299951409
In that respect, dobutamine-stress-echocardiography appears to be superior to DTMS.	0.41530067772069096
The laboratory tests required in patients of different ASA-risk groups and according to their age are presented in an overview.	0.666706043987591
Generalized muscle weakness in critically ill patients can result in prolonged periods of artificial ventilation and longer stays in the intensive care unit.	0.44055020306944553
Both neuropathic (critical illness polyneuropathy) and myopathic (critical illness myopathy) abnormalities seem to play an important role for this prolonged weakness.	0.5178372521588351
This article reviews its complex differential diagnosis with special emphasis on the current understanding of the neuromuscular syndromes.	0.6833439294501716
An efficient diagnostic plan is necessary for the exclusion of other curable causes of prolonged muscle weakness even in the presence of polyneuromyopathic changes.	0.5165558549475551
Psychological support of the patient and prophylaxis of secondary complications of prolonged immobilization are crucial when specific therapy is not possible.	0.7401984240792266
Modern ultrasonic diagnostic instruments with high resolution and color Doppler sonography allow the obstetrician to describe pathological findings very precisely and at an early stage of pregnancy.	0.4950892909209525
The use of high-resolution ultrasound makes it possible to detect heart malformations already between the 8th and 10th week of gestation.	0.5462620143087599
This development has essentially changed the clinical requirements on fetal autopsy which in its traditional way no longer meets the increased demands.	0.3894076159344358
Unless the pathologists faces this challenge the importance of fetal autopsy will diminish.	0.3330733936349058
Modern image databases and communication techniques allow the pathologist to have direct access to text and images of pre-findings by other clinics.	0.3800853329893927
Great importance, however, must be attached to the interdisciplinary cooperation with obstetricians and geneticists.	0.42392895512284445
We report on routine fetal autopsy by using an interdisciplinary database an the Charité.	0.4990688769295303
Infrainguinal arterial reconstruction for intermittent claudication has been discouraged because of fear of bypass graft failure, significant perioperative complications, and limb loss.	0.5325716824126662
This may be worse than the natural history of the disease.	0.6122976343816157
In our study, we retrospectively evaluated all infrainguinal bypass procedures performed in the past 10 years.	0.7862428058589392
Radiosurgery represents a minimally invasive radiologic method for the treatment of intracranial tumours and arteriovenous malformations.	0.5072102475487148
In 1994 the radiosurgical device 'Leksell Gamma Knife' (LGK) was installed in a dedicated logistic environment for outpatient treatments.	0.4309527048119335
High quality requirements have to be met for radiosurgery.	0.4876713407228556
The target point accuracy taking into account the whole system was shown to be reliably below 0.5 mm whereas the spatial therapeutic resolution was 0.035 cm3.	0.6563717830786098
Quality parameters of the dose plan were evaluated for the first 500 consecutive treatments.	0.6911263886342155
These values and examples of dose plans were used to emphasize the advantages of the treatment principle with multiple isocenters.	0.7124970747844659
An analysis of data in the literature revealed that there is no uniform standard of treatment available in radiosurgery.	0.831152946395226
A highly significant correlation between a risk prediction model for the stereotactic linear accelerator on the one hand and a different model for the LGK on the other could be shown.	0.6924150680033674
This result could be helpful in order to proceed towards a more uniform treatment standard in radiosurgery and to improve overall treatment results.	0.4769537609751477
Even if Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis has not found the true aetiology of puerperal fever - bacteria were identified as pathogens only after his observations - he was the first to consequently use epidemiological methods in order to elucidate connections and influencing factors in the spread of nosocomial infections, to draw the right conclusions from his observations on the transmission of childbed fever and to draw the right consequences by implementing preventive measures, especially the hand disinfection.	0.6475912026685505
He has correctly realized that human beings suffering from purulent or putride lesions or having even died from them can act as infectious sources as can hands of health-care personnel act as vehicles.	0.38213748694696226
As a characteristic feature of nosocomial infection, he noticed that generally only the weakend organism of the patient is involved as an infection target.	0.7204417773393771
The impact of his doctrine not only made him "saviour of the mothers" but also justifies to regard him as "father of the obstetric infection prevention" if not even as the founder of the modern science-based hospital hygiene.	0.5272155583963396
In this paper we present a method for measuring the wear of the polyethylene inlay in knee joint endoprostheses from standard X-ray images.	0.6918331116388442
Our approach is to estimate the spatial position of the tibial and femoral components of the prostheses from their contours in the X-ray image.	0.6586124914532606
When we know the exact shape of these two components, we can calculate the minimal spatial distance between them which approximates the remaining thickness of the inlay.	0.6555469891074055
First results show that this approach might provide sufficient accuracy for the given task.	0.5327313038283445
Most children with borreliosis show cutaneous symptoms following a tick bite infected with Borrelia Burgdorferi.	0.3427254038381443
Erythema migrans is a classical skin lesion of early borreliosis characterized by a centrifugally expanding erythema at the site of the prior tick bite.	0.43542491710535236
After hematological spreading of the vector multiple erythemata migrantia occur with a very low incidence in Europe as described in the case of a 2 1/2 years old infant who was successfully treated with oral cephalosporine.	0.6527963943961038
One year follow-up revealed no further manifestations of borreliosis.	0.4354863331102002
This means an excellent prognosis for those children with borreliosis who are treated promptly.	0.5076128654267762
Background: We compared the standard suprathreshhold strategy to the so-called threshhold splitting strategy with 5 and 2 dB steps.	0.5900190410945211
The aim of the study was to establish whether the threshhold splitting strategy had advantages over the suprathreshhold strategy that has been used to date.	0.7105998045638106
Resection specimens of 14 patients with small cell bronchial carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were processed histologically and graded according to a three-step regression grading system: grade I, no or only slight tumor regression; grade II, incomplete tumor regression; grade III, complete tumor regression without vital tumor tissue.	0.6189975216282119
In five patients with either no vital tumor tissue or only small tumor remnants in the resection samples, a typical sequence of central fresh tumor necrosis, foam cell rim, vascular granulation tissue and peripheral scar formation was seen.	0.6107423240268134
This morphological finding may be interpreted as a characteristic, but unspecific parameter of good response to preoperative chemotherapy.	0.5906995668440731
The presence of vital tumor rims surrounding the capillary bed with intermingled necrotic foci, however, argues in favor of spontaneous tumor regression, which is commonly observed in small cell lung cancer.	0.5233090843895747
Background: The term "Castleman's diseas" (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) comprises a heterogeneous clinicopathologic entity among lymphoproliferative disorders.	0.45735490495364906
In accordance with the German law on care for helpless persons, an observer rating scale has been developed to allow a staging of need of care.	0.700920315409678
Construction of the scale, item descriptions, definitions, algorithms for sum score and inter-rater reliability data are reported.	0.39733780629851423
The scale can reliably measure the need of care, quality of care, and who is the care provider.	0.7075907272151912
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) improves the success of trabeculectomy.	0.6290388441295575
Since in vitro studies showed a prolonged effect of 36 days of growth inhibition with a single dose of 5-FU, 5-FU is applied intraoperatively.	0.7899033455508387
To evaluate the effect of intraoperatively applied 5-FU, we compared 13 (low-risk) patients with intraoperative application of 5-FU to a control group matched by age, diagnosis, sex and stage of glaucoma.	0.8618649479850721
Postoperatively on day 4 the IOP was significant lower (4.8 mmHg) in the 5-FU-group in comparison to the untreated group (P=0.005; power 0.80).	0.7110625044448259
After 1 week the difference decreased to 2 mmHg and was not significant any more (P=0.16).	0.5668810685786151
After 1 week a lower mean intraocular pressure of 2 mmHg was found with a P-value of 0.16.	0.5727718322899363
It may be that these results are not just due to an antiproliferative mechanism; a direct toxic effect of 5-FU should be considered.	0.7848807755839865
5-FU side effects such as corneal complications and inflammatory reaction were not increased in the 5-FU group.	0.6264651752701001
However, one case of persistent hypotony was seen in the 5-FU group.	0.8701337407544459
This study found intraoperative use of 5-FU to be a safe procedure with a pronounced capacity to lower IOP in the direct postoperative phase.	0.6863103385886639
However, this effect may not be based on an antiproliferative effect alone, but might be of toxic origin.	0.8858621042539443
A postoperative bile fistula is a rare but severe complication after biliary surgery.	0.676069652782492
Clinical signs, laboratory findings, ultrasound and ERC lead to diagnosis.	0.5400062720117454
We report on 40 cases with postoperative bile leakage after cholecystectomy treated by a nasobiliary tube.	0.5661444131730503
In all patients the fistula healed within 7 days after placement of the tube.	0.7222181650043851
Two patients needed operative treatment of a subhepatic abscess, and in 2 patients drainage of a bilioma was performed.	0.8768094736218356
In 2 cases with biliary peritonitis, a step-by-step lavage was necessary.	0.620151812115574
The nasobiliary tube for postoperative bile fistula offers regular radiological control and reduces the necessity of operative reintervention in the biliary tract.	0.4512369844253481
Description of a 27 years old patient with chronic renal failure due to diabetes, which requires dialysis, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, who developed fulminant systemic calciphylaxis after successful renal transplantation.	0.7281693757014266
Characteristic of this syndrome, there occured soft tissue calcification, mediacalcinosis of the small and medium-sized arteries and ischemic skin necrosis.	0.6353498227544515
The pathogenesis is not completely clear, but challenging agents like corticosteroids or immunsuppressants, in a sensitized organism (at hypercalcemia or elevated parathormon) could lead to calcium deposits.	0.7173909498745199
These are showing a particular affinity for elastic tissue.	0.3116641155371612
Lungs, stomach, kidneys, cutis, heart and vascular system are most frequently involved.	0.5494527114364374
Treatment is primarily supportive; an early parathyroidectomy seems to have the best prognosis.	0.6457594729738769
Contact urticaria and anaphylactic reactions to latex-containing rubber products are being recognized with increasing frequency in all kinds of medical disciplines.	0.5294411713902761
Recently a number of reports have been published describing anaphylactic reactions to food items in patients with latex allergy.	0.6323433360193811
The cases of three patients who developed anaphylactic reactions to both latex and food items are presented, and the importance of the association of latex and cross-reactivity with food items is stressed.	0.7320543509441533
The food items that led to anaphylactic reactions were banana and avocado; banana, avocado and buckwheat; and banana, avocado and tomato.	0.3612413940880053
The cross-reactivity of latex to buckwheat and tomato has not been reported before.	0.4924324530141654
The branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR syndrome) is characterized by auricular abnormalities, lateral cervical fistulas and preauricular tags.	0.5012041710481947
The hearing impairment may be a conductive, a sensorineural or a mixed hearing loss.	0.5857768798290904
The renal disease is oligomeganephronia, a bilateral, congenital renal abnormality with reduced numbers of nephrons.	0.5490886431164321

The CO2 laser myringotomy is a current low-pain procedure for middle-ear ventilation for secretory otitis media (SOM) that can be performed under topical anesthesia, even in children.	0.6664574978198339
The duration of middle-ear ventilation is essentially determined by the size of the perforation created.	0.6478759667049075
Perforations with a diameter greater than 2 mm ventilate the tympanic cavity for approximately 3 weeks, thus avoiding tympanic ventilation tubes.	0.6100327920288103
To date, the CO2 laser beam can only be reliably applied to the tympanic membrane via a micromanipulator system coupled to an ear microscope.	0.5726496213325992
The CO2 laser otoscope is a new application system that markedly reduces the technical complexity of surgery and improves the mobility and availability of the system.	0.6490064274130249
The incorporation of a small inexpen-sive CO2 laser in the otoscope represents a significant development in SOM therapy.	0.4124212595380573
Abstract   Amifostine is an organic thiophsophate which protecvts normal cells from the effects of chemotherapy with reduced nadir and duration of cyclophosphmamid induced neutropenia, reduced cisplatin derived renal and neurological complications being described.	0.4451250883609991
However, no data are available for urological malignancies treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.	0.674451881487756
Aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of pretreatment with amifostine in terms of prevention of renal, hematopoetic and neurologic toxicity.	0.5374661580081141
17 patients (mean age: 62.6 [45-74]) with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder received inductive or adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy (1-6 cycles) with a cisplatin dose of 70 mg/m2.	0.8079550558716369
Amifostine (740-910 mg/m2) was administered intravenously 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy.	0.5575214684410258
For all patients creatinine clearance, serum creatinine and electrolytes including magnesium, and blood cell count were determined prior to and after each cycle.	0.6671601335532554
A group of 12 patients (mean age: 61.9 [51-67]) did undergo MVEC chemotherapy (1-4 cycles) without receiving amifostine and served as control group.	0.8153799145031558
Amifostine was well tolerated and only 1 patient suffered from gastrointestinal discomfort, blood pressure remained unchanged in all patients.	0.7245480356146635
Amifostine prevented a significant reduction of creatinine clearance even in the 2 patients with known renal insufficiency: mean creatinine clearance was 125  +/-  20 ml/min prior to and 115  +/-  25 ml/min after chemotherapy.	0.7063923296738158
In the control group, however, creatinine clearance dropped from 121  +/-  30 ml/min to 85  +/-  20 ml/min after completion of MVEC chemotherapy.	0.6331802180056024
Serum creatinine levels did not increase significantly (1.1 mg/dl prior to and 1.2 mg/dl after chemotherapy), magnesium levels did not decrease significantly and normalized at the end of chemotherapy.	0.8491844031342143
Significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed in 29 % and 12 % of the patients in the amifostine group and in 67 % and 33 % of the patients in the control group.	0.9868281926261161
Amifostine was shown to have a protective effect against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in the elderly patient undergoing systemic chemotherapy.	0.6701560952238339
Based on our data amifostine should be applied in the supportive management to prevent chemotherapy induced complications.	0.594460146272811
The diagnosis of leptomeningeal dissemination of chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) by conventional cytology is unreliable because cytomorphologic criteria of malignancy are often lacking.	0.5215842302693018
Immunophenotyping of leukocyte differentiation antigens may also be of limited diagnostic value due to the small  number of cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples.	0.5554991422972464
Molecular methods may support the specific diagnosis of leptomeningeal infiltration of CLL.	0.4502265352137155
We present an 54 old patient who was diagnosed with CLL five years ago.	0.6055704639867375
Despite clinical signs of leptomeningeal  involvement neither magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nor conventional CSF analysis were suggestive of lymphomatous meningitis.	0.39829409630777846
Using PCR we selectively amplified the highly variable and clone-specific CDR3 region of the locus encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) in DNA obtained from both CSF and peripheral blood cells.	0.491362409903368
Analysis of PCR products by high resolution gel electrophoresis revealed a single DNA fragment respectively indicating the presence of a  monoclonal cell population in both  compartments.	0.46731510088227773
DNA sequence analysis of the amplified CDR3 segments confirmed the clonal identity of cells and the leptomeningeal dissemination of CLL.	0.4653037480415626
In the orthopedic department of the University Hospital Homburg/Saar, we use since 1993 a computer-based system for clinics organisation and documentation of operations.	0.6893860670958083

In one third of the little girls coming to the outpatient clinic for pediatric gynecology, a vulvovaginitis can be diagnosed.	0.6551794761884844
Etiologic factors are poor perineal hygiene, foreign bodies in the vagina and respiratory or skin infections.	0.4653222566500164
The microbiologic investigation often reveals staphylococci, streptococci, E. coli, and in case of chronical-recurrent discharge also B. fragilis and peptostreptococci.	0.6094740588698955
The symptoms are itching, burning, dysuria, discharge and rubor of the vulva.	0.45874497919278423
A systemic application of antibiotics is not necessary, a local treatment with antibiotic solutions is contraindicated and the usual vaginal suppositories are unsuitable for girls.	0.6086412441172657
A desinfection often irritates the vulvovaginal region of little girls so that for years we use estriol ointment only which is tolerated.	0.3236640152874919
Excellently, a single-dose application being sufficient; burning, itching and discharge disappear and the vaginal epithelium gets more resistant because of the estrogen influence, so that the healing process is accelerated.	0.5912776615911435

Then the most important results of the recent infant research and the research of attachment behaviour, especially those of the group of Fonagy, and their importance for the theory of symbol formation are discussed.	0.866084529372591
The theory of potential space is used as a base for understanding imaginative processes.	0.49058892865403286
General and special technical recommandations for the treatment of borderline cases with guided affective imagery are derived.	0.42813495132745616
Especially the relationship to the theories of Bion, Ogden and Winnicott is estimated.	0.34896406407539116
The situation of psychiatric patients in the Ukraine is determined by the financial and economic difficulties of this country.	0.6646121735573407
In the larger cities, so-called polyclinics take care of ambulant psychiatric patients.	0.45983864599035024
However, no other social psychiatric institutions exist.	0.5896692592907937
Here, the modalities of hospital psychiatric treatment are discussed using the psychiatric hospitals in Kiev and Shitomir as examples.	0.5412718811775571
Undertreatment is also a problem, because only a few psychopharmacological drugs are produced in the Ukraine.	0.7287013371470547
Import of new psychopharmacological agents is hampered by economical problems.	0.31317152571004586
Improving the availability of psychopharmacological drugs and the establishment of a social psychiatric network are major aims for psychiatrists working in Ukraine.	0.4001382338784189
Renal lesions are frequently encountered in blunt pediatric abdominal trauma.	0.3169891249579285
In this retrospective study, we analyzed the incidence of renal trauma in these trauma patients to determine which diagnostic and therapeutic approaches were most predictive.	0.7286715861274313
From 1976 to 1996, 308 children sustaining blunt abdominal trauma were admitted to our department.	0.44388724625751846
Patients were evaluated using abdominal paracentesis, ultrasonography, and urinary analysis.	0.624004448592377
In specific cases, IV urography, CT scan, and/or angiography were applied.	0.6703319889790151
We used the Organ Injury Scale (OIS) for classification of renal trauma into five grades.	0.5918856902069192
The result of a B-scan ultrasound examination is strongly dependent on the type of the used B-system, the chosen system parameters and the experience and critical analysis of the clinical investigator.	0.7406241736510836
The estimation of quantitative acoustic parameters, independent of the type of the used B-system, is one way to overcome the subjective nature and the problems of the interpretation of B-scan images.	0.7612980349416734
Results of a longitudinal study about the transition to retirement are presented.	0.5518699336037493
329 persons were interviewed three times (quantitative study) and 20 persons conducted a semi-structured diary (qualitative study), covering in both groups a two-year period (from half a year before retirement to one and a half years after retirement).	0.6012765338533989
They were asked about their subjective well-being (happiness, joy, satisfaction, stresses), their life situation and their personal, social and material resources.	0.529572775904448
The results show that the transition to retirement brings with it gains (leisure time) and losses (financial, social status), but overall maintains a high level of well-being.	0.6536596177359539
Specific analyses point out inter-individual differences, risk factors and resources, like a high level of trait well-being, health, social networks and an optimistic outlook.	0.6126070525780701
The diary analyses lead to specifications, more detailed process analyses and hypotheses about cohort effects.	0.4436612582780415
Consequences for an adequate preparation for retirement are discussed.	0.34057941844936607
Intraoperative complications can be divided into three categories on the basis of the time of their occurrence: Group I - Problems associated with access; group II: introduction of the endovascular stent (a: release of the main segment, b: anchoring the second limb); and group III: incidence of primary endoleaks.	0.7375365172150873
Interferon alpha and gamma have been used to treat several hepatic, hematological and oncological diseases for years.	0.534642168051671
Recently, interferon beta has been introduced as a therapeutic agent in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.	0.5959378010283544
A 41-year-old female patient with multiple sclerosis developed non-tender, palm-sized, cutaneous-subcutaneous, reddish infiltrates at the injection sites on her thighs after 8 weeks of treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta injections.	0.5623072222329496
Histopathology revealed a perivascular lymphoid infiltrate of the dermis and a subtle lobular lymphoid infiltrate of the subcutis.	0.46935738556541606
Interferon beta therapy was discontinued for 4 weeks.	0.43313047860238485
With topical corticosteroids, the skin lesions resolved.	0.8226734061196932
When subcutaneous injections were resumed at a reduced dose, only erythema around injection sites developed without induration or pain.	0.4465843686398756
Slight erythema and swelling at interferon beta injection site are frequent and rare cases of cutaneous necrosis have been described.	0.4806265774314794
However, no reports of large, painful, cutaneous-subcutaneous infiltrates after interferon beta therapy have been published.	0.5778159410338773
In adults, infectious spondylitis is a rare but severe disease, caused by a bacterial thrombus in tissue of reduced resistance.	0.6861059823426365
In conventional radiographs initial findings are a narrowing of the intervertebral space, local osteoporosis and poorly defined erosive borders of the vertebral endplates.	0.6263534775552564
These changings can be found at least three to six weeks after the onset of disease.	0.7788738269695037
However, in Szintigraphy and MRT pathologic alterations are evident after ten to twelve days.	0.48052992364280933
Thus, early diagnosis and treatment becomes possible.	0.8221109947926759
In early stages of the disease a localized lysis surrounded by a reactive sclerosis appears in predisposed areas of the vertebral body (subchondral, anterobasal, ventral, central).	0.5881185985362236
Apparently, a soft tissue tumor is associated.	0.6302838134017802
Sclerosis and reduction of the soft tissue tumor are the first signs of repair processes.	0.6270394464514045
After at least 12 weeks, computed tomography can reveal typical sintering of the vertebral body and occasionally the development of a bony sequester.	0.5835516946240952
In addition, MRT as well as CT can be helpful in the detection and localization of complications as abscesses or affection of the vertebral canal.	0.6687342744198874
The tuberculous spondylitis can sometimes cause difficulties in differential diagnosis.	0.22239500527174885
Clinical findings, affection of several vertebral bodies, large soft tissue tumors with appearance of calcification as well as not typical locations are strongly suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis, but these findings are not specific of the disease.	0.6313039076457199
Degenerative disorders such as erosive osteochondrosis or changings due to chronic dialysis (e. g. amyloid or crystal arthropathies) may cause even more problems in differential diagnosis.	0.5127718700616438
Typical for a blastomatous process is the integrity of the interverebral disc space, which is a rare finding in spondylitis.	0.7820611410591383
To show the possibilities of imaging diagnostic procedures using high and extremely high resolution ultrasonic probes we investigated the anatomic structures of the foot.	0.594841345619613
We examinated 10 cadaver foots of the anatomic institute and in a clinical trial 20 healthy patients with 10 to 20-MHz-probes and could identify correctly single tendons and ligaments even in the toe region.	0.5377125466162802
Especially the possibility of dynamic examination had to be mentioned beside the other advantages of ultrasound diagnostic (saving of expenses, lack of radiation, side-to-side comparison).	0.5489936402829164
An essential parameter for the incorporation of drugs and narcotics into head hair is the content of hair pigment (melanins).	0.451583805881264
Toxicological studies of hair should therefore take the colour of the hair into consideration.	0.5359692884705622
As the available vocabulary for verbal characterisation is small and the description depends on the subjective opinion of the viewer, it was the purpose of this study to investigate if colorimetric measurements allow objectivation of hair colour.	0.6819412069782966
The natural hair colour of 17 subjects was described subjectively in words and by comparing it with a hair colour chart (Wella, Darmstadt, Germany).	0.44876141828792243
Subsequently the colours of the hair and the samples of the hair colour chart used for comparison were measured by colorimetric analysis and the CIEL*a*b* values were determined.	0.5961428698454181
The descriptive categorisation of the hair colours (e.g.	0.371710626683632
blonde, brown, black) could often not be recognised in the colorimetric results.	0.5020740785451444
Sometimes considerable differences were also found between the colour values of the natural hair samples and the specimens used for comparison.	0.6928379219074441
When the colour measurements were repeated at intervals of several days the results were found to be reproducible.	0.6805427905781171
We measured the ventilatory pattern and additional work of breathing (WOBadd) at three different levels of inspiratory pressure support [IPS 5, 10, 15 mbar above positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)] and in a new ventilatory mode, automatic tube compensation (ATC), in nine operative patients without lung injury nine patients ventilated for several following acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI).	0.6513426631133011
In ATC, endotracheal tube resistance is compensated automatically by means of closed-loop control of the calculated tracheal pressure.	0.5268589854707217
Pressure support in this mode, i. e. airway pressure above PEEP, is equal to the actual flow-dependent pressure drop across the endotracheal tube (ETT).	0.5951980229085196
Airway pressure rises at the beginning of inspiration and falls towards the end.	0.37510543584493206
As the tube resistance of ETT seriously hinders expiration and can cause desynchronization between ventilator and patient, airway pressure is reduced below PEEP during expiration in the same way as it is increased during inspiration.	0.5074889824092548
The result is a near-constant tracheal pressure at PEEP both during inspiration and during expiration.	0.45224535657412573
This mode could be best termed as "electronic extubation".	0.3576666125120707
The most striking difference between the postoperative patients and the ARI patients was their minute ventilation (17.8+/-1.85 l/min in ARI patients vs 7.3+/-3.1 l/min in the postoperative patients).	0.8696643499848321
In the postoperative patients augmentation of IPS from 5 to 15 mbar induced a steady increase in tidal volume (VT) and a consecutive decrease in respiratory rate (rr) compared with ATC (VTATC,postop= 463+/-78 ml; rrATC,postop =16+/-4 min-1; VTIPS5,postop = 505+/-79 ml; rrIPS5,postop = 15+/-4 min-1; VTIPS10,postop = 562+/-86 ml; rrIPS15,postop =14+/-4 min-1; VTIPS15,postop=660+/- 151 ml; rrTPS15, postop = 12+/-4 min-1), whereas the augmentation of IPS of 5 and 10 mbar in the ARI patients could not compensate for the increase in rr and the decrease in VT, after switching from ATC to IPS (VTATC,ARI 724+/-308 ml, rrATC,ARI = 24+/-6 min-1; VTIPS5,ARI = 649+/-315 ml; rrIPS 5,ARI = 27+/-8 min-1; VTIPS10,ARI=653+/-353 ml; rrIPS10,ARI = 25+/-8 min-1: Even IPS 15 was not able to reestablish VT at the values observed during ATC (VTIPS15,ARI =680+/-312 ml).	0.609696372621619
During ATC WOBadd was small in both postoperative and ARI patients (WOBadd,ATC,postop = 93+/-36 mJ/l, WOBadd,ATC,ARI =116 +/-72 mJ/l).	0.5553365736568707
In the postoperative patients, an inspiratory pressure support of 5 mbar was not sufficient to compensate WOBadd compared with ATC.	0.7002782962360968
However, IPS 10 and 15 mbar were able to compensate for WOBadd (WOBadd.ATC5,postop WOBadd,IPS5,postop =189+/-77 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS10,postop = 55+/-30 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS15,postop = 21+/-11 mJ/l).	0.567834154363608
In the ARI patients an IPS 5, 10 or 15 mbar was not sufficient to compensate for WOBadd (WOBadd,IPS 5,ARI = 1126+/-262 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS 10,ARI 863+/-253 mJ/l; WOBadd,IPS 15,ARI 763+/-298 mJ/l).	0.5748761458510692
Under ATC, WOBadd was only 15% of WOBadd under IPS of 15 mbar.	0.6114895720463259
All but two patients were successfully extubated after the investigation.	0.5785521361602803
These two patients were not extubated because they were dependent on an FIO2 >0.5.	0.6234984502626537
Our results strongly indicate that ventilatory dependence in ARI patients may be caused by the ETT rather than by mechanical dysfunction of the lung.	0.617653148532158
ATC is a very helpful mode to use in distinguishing between ventilatory failure caused by ETT and real ventilatory dependence.	0.5179056394135637
The preoperative localization of pharmaco-resistent focal epilepsies before surgery and the prognosis concerning seizure outcome are both of importance.	0.5378050187808341
In addition to conventional MRI diagnostics for the detection of small epileptogenic lesions, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (HMR spectroscopy) can be useful for assessing the bilaterality of pathological changes in cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies.	0.5662884823764492
The technique and findings of HMR spectroscopy are reported in patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies.	0.4778090921839442
The findings indicate that chemical shift imaging (CSI) investigations of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres provide important information for the prediction of seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery.	0.4880007162898097
This paper describes the conceptual considerations in planning and realizing an inpatient unit for traumatized patients.	0.3388186399302205
The different concepts of the dynamic of the traumatic disease and the aetiopathology of posttraumatic stressdisease (PTSD) are highly significant in regard to the realisation of differing concepts of inpatient therapy of trauma.	0.6163015410234483
The utilisation of Konzentrative Bewegungstherapy (KBT) and Creative Therapy in our conflict- and solution-oriented analytic concept permits us to neglect a fictitious contradiction between traumaexposure and traumalimitation and a "potential space" (Winnicott) can be opened to the creative work with the patients.	0.5222176760408762
This paper illustrates with some casuistic examples the utilisation of KBT in transforming the traumatic body-flashbacks into narrative memory-scripts, by the use of symbolizing processes.	0.43245199331446127
In 55 consecutive patients with the same dual chamber pacemaker (Relay, Intermedics) and different pacing leads, the influence of different safety margins for pacing on battery current was investigated.	0.675174438688931
2.8 +/- 0.9 years after implantation, atrial and ventricular pulse-width thresholds (tRS) (ms) were determined at 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 V, and the charge delivered at threshold was telemetered.	0.9161359434194848
If tRS was <1.50 ms at 0.5 V, an amplitude of 1.0 V was programmed in the atrium and the ventricule; if tRS was <1.50 ms at 1.0 V, then an amplitude of 2.0 V was chosen.	0.7159768475085421
Two times the charge threshold (2x QRS), two times the voltage threshold (2x URS), and three times the pulse-width threshold (3x tRS) were programmed as the safety margins for pacing.	0.671976570636447
With every safety margin, battery current (IRS) (µA) was averaged from 5 telemetric readings in D00 mode with 70 bpm.	0.5231038829125596
IBat was significantly lower with 2x QRS as compared with 2x URS (13.43 +/- 1.0 vs. 14.20 +/- 1.2 µA, p<0.01) and as compared with 3x tRS (13.99 +/- 1.2 µA, p<0.05).	0.6747065091320197
Pacemaker longevity derived from these current data was significantly longer with 2x QRS (112 +/- 8 months) as compared with 2x URS (106 +/- 9, p<0.01) and as compared with 3x tRS (108 +/- 8, p<0.05).	0.6928128691717013
If current consumption is compared intraindividually in dependance on the programmed amplitude, battery current is significantly lower at 1.0 V as compared with 2.0 V resulting in a mean reduction of 0.63 µA (-4.9%, p<0.05) and an average gain in longevity of 5 months.	0.7855217677102343
This applies to every safety margin tested.	0.33021689203784016
Differences in battery current caused by the safety margins will translate into a greater gain in longevity in future pacemaker models with reduced internal current consumption.	0.4472808285831171
Any medical procedure must be legally authorized by the patient, giving informed consent.	0.554423663281514
This prerequisite is based on the right to self determination.	0.7702097169273014
Otherwise a medical procedure is considered as physical injury.	0.5273919600109621
Thus, the way, how a specific procedure is performed, predominantly depends on the patient's will.	0.8325249621971228
The attending physician's duty is to find out this will, which is especially important when old patients and patients incapable of giving valid consent are involved.	0.6434215556815992
Before the procedure the physician has to have a confidential talk with the patient.	0.6495741517920632
He has to point out the best treatment possible considering the individual circumstances of the patient's life.	0.707616293311068
The physician has to find out, weather the patient is competent to refuse or consent to treatement.	0.5923042092910877
Furthermore the consultation is an opportunity to diminish the patient's fear and to increase his confidence.	0.5411619516511991
The main problem treating old patients is that they often lack the mental ability for appreciation of the nature of the situation.	0.6380005914322393
One has to differentiate between the physiological mental decay and dementia or psychiatric diseases.	0.49483470783496275
In these cases a third party consent is necessary.	0.5128694365827411
This review of German neurology during the Nazi era mentions first the significance of Jewish neurologists for the history of the specialty, and the irreplaceable loss that their expulsion from Germany represented.	0.5665667700796287
A brief discussion of the scientific accomplishments of German neurologists during this time is followed by a description of violations of ethical principles, exemplified by the human experiments of G. Schaltenbrand.	0.5656832814509154
The spirit of the age exerted a malevelent influence.	0.31336047742148065
A postal survey targeted at 1000 firms in the metal- and electronic working industry of Northrhine Westfalia was carried out by Sozialforschungsstelle Dortmund und Institute of geronotology to analyze the implementation of the collective agreement concerning partial retirement.	0.48500930212964644
As the results show, firms in Northrhine Westfalia are willing to accept the collective agreement and use partial retirement though there are still problems left to solve.	0.5546061046602406
Firms are further using partial retirement as an instrument of early retirement.	0.42212504672738266
Therefore partial retirement is created as a so-called "blocked model".	0.3407008756864568
From February 1991 to May 1998, 340 patients had a cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) implanted.	0.5365434208371164
Mean age was 64  +/-  9 years, 278 male and 62 female.	0.6388147472242893
60% of patients had coronary artery disease and 31% dilative cardiomyopathy.	0.8623732052890455
Ejection fraction was 38  +/-  14%.	0.5211963452510894
The indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was in 57% of patients ventricular tachycardia, in 43% ventricular fibrillation.	0.7614754425163416
298 patients had a single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator implanted, 42 patients a dual-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator.	0.5872715499052343
In 25 patients additional subcutaneous patch or array electrodes and in 2 patients additional epicardial patch electrodes were implanted.	0.49969994037869886
Implantation site was in 92 patients abdominal and in 248 pectoral.	0.37521334998100714
Over a period of 7 years 34 lead-related complications occured in 33 patients (9.7%), after a median of 2 months after implantation.	0.7725271157088865
Diagnosis was made by routine chest x-ray in about 55% of lead-related complications, by clinical presentation (inadequate therapy, pain) in 24%, and by electrical parameters in 21%.	0.8327283966023912
In patients with an abdominal implantation site, lead-related complications occurred in 20%, in contrast to 6% in patients with a pectoral implantation site.	0.9618006921904363
Regarding patients with pectoral implantation site, lead-related complications were observed in 12% of patients with a dual-chamber ICD vs 4% with a single-chamber ICD (p = 0.05), due to dislocation of atrial electrodes with dual-chamber ICD.	0.8064547222165399
There were no differences in clinical parameters between patients with pectoral vs abdominal and between single vs dual-chamber ICD.	0.5661058639557909
Several new approaches are available for early defibrillation.	0.5356105070759287
One example is semiautomatic defibrillators used by the first arriving emergency staff.	0.48198225633256125
The recommendations for introducing emergency medical technician (EMT) defibrillation in Germany are based either on the results in cities with so called doctor-manned-ambulances or the experiences of the German multi-center-study.	0.5953075983557695
This analysis intends to contribute data to an EMT defibrillation program in cities with a so called rendezvous-system.	0.44153034806947167
Methods: In a prospective study a EMT-defibrillation group (= DG) was compared with a standard group (basic life support by EMTs and defibrillation by emergency physicians) (= SG) and a control group (emergency physicians starting resuscitation alone or together with EMTs) (= CG).	0.7993866858841853
In the DG semiautomatic defibrillators from Laerdal (Heartstart 3000) were used.	0.5589372085690126
Successfully resuscitated patients were followed up with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the Pittsburgh Brain Stem Score (PBSS), and Pittsburgh Cerebral (CPC) and Overall Performance Categorie (OPC).	0.5816063136009962
Results: Over 13 months 43 patients were included, primarily presenting with ventricular fibrillation (VF).	0.5307139952550045
Depending on the first arriving emergency staff the patients were allocated to the DG (n = 12), to the SG (n = 18) or to the CG (n = 13).	0.6934807345426574
DG and SG did not differ significantly concerning the primary survival rate or the long-term prognosis (primary successful 8.3% vs. 38.9%, definite successful 0% vs. 27.8%).	0.5945552159867113
The primary survival rate in the DG was significantly lower than in the CG (8.3% vs. 61.5%).	0.7127413227672685
In the long term survival rate there were no significant differences.	0.6987247080182586
In the DG significantly less patients received bystander CPR (8.3%) than in the other groups (55.6% and 69.2%).	0.8116678549626796
Neither the variable "witnessed collapes" nor "bystander CPR" had a significant influence for the outcome of the patients in this study.	0.7704973587229421
The average response time for the first arriving rescue team was 5.5 +/- 2.4 min, without a significant difference between the groups.	0.8840809984624567
Conclusions: A comparison of this study with American, European and German recommendations for EMT defibrillation programms revealed some deviations.	0.6177140455635385
Bystander CPR seems to be of special importance as well as the time interval between defibrillation and the arrival of the emergency physician.	0.7720117862915387
A benefit of EMT defibrillation could not be demonstrated in our "rendezvous-system", possibly because the time interval was less than 4 min (3.5 min).	0.8203937280653495
Since the result is in accordance with the German multi-center-study, a critical consideration of a EMT defibrillation program seems to be necessary in "Rendezvous-systems".	0.7162835231236816
Ninety-two strains of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) from 80 patients of 31 hospitals in 11 federal states were analyzed.	0.465902698111035
They were primarily isolated in intensive care units (general, surgical, internistic, pediatric, oncological ones), but also in nephrologic/dialysis or neurologic/orthopaedic wards.	0.6239516619120373
A dominance of VanA type E. faecium strains was observed (n=81; 88.0%).	0.46814156355399866
In addition, strains of E. faecalis (VanA; n=4; 4.4%), E. faecium (VanB; n=1; 1.1%), and E. gallinarum (VanC1, n=6; 6.5%) were found.	0.710490664030055
The 81 VanA strains of E. faecium possessed the following resistances to other antibiotics: erythromycin, ciprofloxacin (both 93.8%), ampicillin, oxytetracycline (both 88.9%), rifampicin (79.0%), trimethoprim/sulfameracin (61.7%), chloramphenicol (18.9%), fusidic acid (12.3%), quinupristin/dalfopristin (7.4%); gentamicin (46.9%) and streptomycin (37.0%), also together with ampicillin resistance (9.9-35.8%).	0.596873035116323
In some of these VanA type strains resistance to teicoplanin cannot be completely expressed in-vitro.	0.5514582900841556
Macrorestriction analysis of E. faecium outbreak isolates (VanA type) from hospitals in different federal states indicated an intra- and interhospital spread of a defined strain.	0.6599032357937219
However, heterogeneous plasmid and plasmid restriction patterns showed that these strains were not completely identical.	0.3703437763053184
The scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury of the shoulder girdle, mostly associated with polytraumatized critically ill patients.	0.7671205699613175
This case report of 3 patients shows the variety of possible injuries combined with SD.	0.6120664356353362
Diagnosis and therapy in such a rare trauma, which is most likely seen in specialized trauma centres are being described.	0.7656062724607477
The 3 patients are presented from trauma to management, with remarks to various possibilities in treatment.	0.6294809895532578
Reports of other groups include multicenter studies with small numbers of patients, making it different to look for homogenity or defining standards, whereas current guidelines are being mentioned, including remarks on the management of these mostly polytraumatized and vitally endangered patients.	0.5484988957679043
This is a case report on arthroscopic removal of a glass splinter from the knee joint of a 56-year-old male.	0.747470618461411
Recurrent hemarthrosis of the knee was the reason for differential diagnosis, as the patient could not remember any trauma.	0.8888166982274973
After performing MRI, a 12 x 5 mm signal-free zone showed up in the area of the lateral condylus femoris, which was identified through arthroscopy as a glass splinter and removed.	0.6833218967720829
The patient was discharged soon after without any complaints.	0.6166306399810918
Many patients with acquired strabismus do not suffer from diplopia and confusion after an individually and age-dependent interval.	0.4502360750667433
They inhibit the image of the deviated eye by binocular rilvary and particularly by the physiological ability to disregard visually disturbing stimuli.	0.4317398226482886
Red cells, platelet concentrates and fresh frozen plasma of a single donation contain leucocytes, causing a lot of side effects.	0.563454971241381
Modern filtration- and apheresis-techniques lead to a reduction of residual leucocyte counts of <1x106 per unit.	0.6408980619104095
The best method to achieve controlled and validated conditions is the blood bank performed standardised prestorage-filtration.	0.3866746306943592
This is an effective method, to prevent cytokine-mediated and leucocyte-mediated febrile nonhaemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTR), to prevent a primary immunisation to leucocyte- and histocompatibility-antigens, to avoid transmission of viral infections by blood transfusion, e.g.	0.6978578935379789
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and to exclude in special cases bacterial septicaemia.	0.691564012447902
In addition, there are references to reduce the postoperative infections, the rate of recurrence of a tumor and the postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.	0.9271358276577039
The use of leucocyte-depleted blood components for special indications is meanwhile established.	0.4032498297942951
Some European countries have made a decision for a general filtration of all blood components containing leucocytes.	0.43623566471523684
The authors recommend the general leucocyte-depletion of blood components considering the German medical law (AMG) and cost/benefit ratio.	0.5332560293786505
Evaluation of psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatment frequently uses rating scales without regard for patients' defensiveness.	0.3748536436689016
This study demonstrates on 309 psychotherapy patients treated with inpatient client-centered therapy and followed-up 1 year after treatment that defensiveness, measured with validity scales of personality inventories MMPI-K, FPI-R and Gießen-Test, influences ratings (scales CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES) before and after therapy.	0.4736011650552335
Patients who deny psychopathology on admission do so at discharge and to some extent at follow-up.	0.33179002005817826
The extent of effect is significantly diminished with an increase in frankness in these patients, indicated by the significant improvement in validity scales.	0.5533608735294746
Inpatient client-centered psychotherapy improved defensiveness in the case of initial self-criticism and diminished it in the case of initial retentiveness.	0.5001680001829001
Introduction: Because of their frequency and consequences sciatica remains a demanding clinical entity with significant social and economical impact.	0.5389789549042958
There is a high demand on therapeutic modalities, using folk medicine methods in the treatment of orthopaedic  diseases.	0.6731123341976818
No data is available on the usefullness of methods like natural herbs in combination with acupuncture.	0.45988462476711545
Aim of our study was to present data on the effect of acupuncture and cytokineinhibiting natural herbs in sciatic pain.	0.5156516744310954
We compared these  results with nerve root infiltration by local anaesthetics and corticosteroids in our  orthopaedic outpatient clinic.	0.5378195978453062
Materials and Results: 278 patients with chronic pain for at least 3 months were observed.	0.6389762833163688
All three therapeutical modalities showed improvement of pain scores.	0.30173147250727184
Best  results were gained with steroid injection (n=26; 66% pain reduction), acupuncture in combination with herbs improved the pain in average of 62% (n=230), whereas injection with local anaesthetic had a pain reduction of 48% (n=22).	0.5681763282989497
Sole Mepivacain-HCl treatment had significant less pain reduction compared to the other treatment modalities.	0.5443974700083892
Conclusion: According to our results acupuncture in combination with herbs and  steroid nerve blocks appear to be an effective and thus recommendable conservative  therapy in cases of sciatic pain.	0.6566397710087208
Taking into account that patients increasingly prefer ethnomedical modalities of treatment our study gains importance for practising  orthopaedists.	0.43658156837341744
This paper concerns advances in the integration of psychotherapy in psychiatric education and clinical practice and whether they go along with increasing research activities.	0.5473917037630351
To find answers, a survey on psychotherapy research was carried out in all German psychiatric hospitals and departments by means of a questionnaire.	0.6176281009878285
The results indicate that psychotherapy research is done nearly exclusively in university hospitals.	0.39741650175378307
About half of them had already published psychotherapy studies and two thirds of them are presently carrying out studies, mostly including prospective, randomized clinical trials.	0.6481562418546036
These studies cover the whole spectrum of psychiatric disorders: substance abuse, schizophrenic and affective disorders, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive and personality disorders.	0.4951683224208318
To improve psychotherapy research conditions further, efforts are necessary to increase scientific exchange, financial support, and the integration of institutions outside the universities.	0.6437087996824192
There is little to suggest that the course of preeclamsia can be substantially affected by drug treatment.	0.5538712539133959
The vast majority of randomized studies do not indicate beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment on proteinuria, fetal heart rate abnormalities, abruptio placentae and the incidence of preterm birth.	0.48404862815117566
There is also no definite effect on the development of superimposed preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, renal failure or eclampsia.	0.5948139211280046
Moreover, blood pressure lowering agents fail to improve uteroplacental perfusion but may have adverse effects on fetal growth.	0.5397300625997237
Antihypertensive treatment is only indicated in severe hypertension ( > 170/110 mm Hg) to reduce the risk of cerebral hemorrhage.	0.7657376567550839
Dihydralazine injections may result in reduced placental blood flow and fetal distress.	0.46812316598378556
Oral nifedipine offers some advantages in view of more potent vasodilator actions on uterine and fetoplacental vessels and a lower incidence of fetal distress.	0.4582587253050422
Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanism of eclamptic seizure is cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant ischemia.	0.45685047757992336
Cerebral vessels are particularly sensitive to magnesium, which works by reversing cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant improvement in blood flow.	0.4924463468326065
Controlled trials have shown magnesium to be superior to both placebo and phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia.	0.4274442037726476
Furthermore, magnesium has been found to be more effective than diazepam and phenytoin in preventing recurrence of seizures in women with eclampsia.	0.615264233789746
Also the neonatal outcome favors magnesium, which is now generally accepted as the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclampsia.	0.7105821837027022
Baker's cysts were treated operatively in 19 patients in the Department of Traumatology of the University of Cologne from 1988 to 1997.	0.6470357841048661
The subjective and objective results were evaluated with a questionnaire and a clinical examination and sonography (follow-up: 95 %).	0.719522153589774
All patients were examinated before surgery, sonography and X-ray of the knee were performed.	0.7761760759361653
We differentiated between the congenital primary cyst (39 %), and the secondary form, which was always associated with an intraarticular lesion (61 %).	0.7781524497282174
Arthroscopy was performed in all secondary forms of Baker's cyst.	0.5972863773056047
Postoperative complications were two reinterventions due to one hematoma and one effusion.	0.4317513676303654
Patient's evaluation of operation result was "excellent" in 61 % and "good" in 39 % of cases.	0.8388210362407192
All knee joints had a full range of motion.	0.43733118186131953
There was only one case of a recurrent cyst.	0.8420615536130871
The primary form of Baker's cyst has always to be extirpated, according to our clinical experience.	0.4959385078189628
The extirpation of the secondary Baker's cyst and the relevance of arthroscopy and treatment of the basic disease have to be discussed.	0.7208530030322214
In median avcuate ligament syndrome, compression of the celiac artery is caused by an abnormally low insertion of the median arcuate ligament in the presence of normally located celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.	0.4946151949172568
A lot of controversy exists concerning the indication for operation and the best mode of treatment.	0.544335054435311
Depending on the presence and quality of collateral pathways, the symptoms vary considerably.	0.7584034857566503
We report a rare case of arcuate ligament syndrome with two-vessel involvement.	0.5278004061905847
In such cases surgical treatment seems to offer substantial benefit.	0.5433065695375142
Usually transsection of the compressing arcuate ligament is sufficient.	0.2771472667454748
Bypass procedures should remain limited to cases in which transsection does not enable a significant increase in splanchnic blood flow.	0.4764989345012734
The microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood films for the diagnosis of malaria is a highly sensitive technique.	0.4457076879959964
However, the expertise required is a major disadvantage.	0.7021366774705298
Recently, methods not dependent on microscopy have become commercially available.	0.4053874255059401
The use of an antigen-capture assay for the detection of histidine-rich protein 2, an antigen specific for Plasmodium falciparum, forms the basis of the ParaSight-F (Becton Dickinson) and the ICT Malaria Pf test (ICT Diagnostics).	0.5860358725806196
Parasite lactate dehydrogenase is the basis of another immunographic dipstick assay developed by Flow Inc.	0.3510811380678092
These currently available assays have been evaluated in a number of trials giving sensitivities and specificities of 90-100%.	0.42310878133274465
A decreased sensitivity is found in cases with low parasitemia.	0.6580567763408641
However, false-negative  results have also been reported in patients with high parasite densities.	0.7359597651130513
Purpose: Discussion in the literature of peripheral nerve lesions after surgical treatment is based mainly on orthopedic surgery or on ischemic syndromes.	0.7183983451171336
There is no information about the frequency of nerve lesions after revascularization of the lower limb.	0.801302369638381
Methods: Between 1992 and 1996, 436 patients underwent peripheral arterial revascularization, including 147 cases of deep revascularization, 127 supra-genicular femoro-popliteal bypasses, 116 infra-genicular femoro-popliteal bypasses and 56 femoro-crural bypasses.	0.44676381828861084
Mean patient age was 70.5 +/- 5.8 years; 182 patients were female and 254 were male.	0.5385452257787389
There was a 38% rate (166/436) of reoperation.	0.659880445181518
All patients were examined based on anamnestic information and a detailed clinical neurological investigation, including the methods of Weber and Moberg.	0.7209715517310115
Results: We found eleven patients (4%) with peripheral nerve lesions after the primary operation.	0.9586177535270239
After the reoperation 55 patients (33%) had nerve lesions.	0.6165621768410484
Conclusions: Peripheral nerve lesions with sensory disturbance were present in 15% of our patients on discharge from hospital.	0.7319525850141235
They had mainly dysesthesia and hypesthesia but no kind of motor dysfunction.	0.28636787558128524
In our opinion, detailed preoperative information is very important because of the risk of sensitive nerve lesions.	0.5696193187285076
Classic and HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) are predominantly found in male Caucasians.	0.6115543945784043
It is unclear why KS is so rare in women.	0.3851384308909069
At the Department of Dermatology, University of Frankfurt, epidemic KS was diagnosed in 299/751 (40%) male and 5/72 (18%) female HIV-infected patients.	0.5467105332685701
To detect common parameters regarding immunodeficiency, hormonal disturbances, abnormalities in clinical course, or sexual practices, data of eight women with KS (five HIV+, three HIV-) were compared.	0.7632167950260417
In HIV+ women KS is more aggressive than in HIV- women and more aggressive than in HIV+ men.	0.5123149414180576
Early and frequent visceral involvement and no preference for the lower extremities are found.	0.4966125065582027
Compared to HIV- women with KS, HIV+ women are generally younger (mean age 38 vs 71 years) and significantly immunodeficient (reduced absolute CD4 cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio).	0.6148113534192389
All women with KS investigated for sexual hormones (7/8) showed abnormalities: 7/7 had low oestrogens, 4/6 low LH and 3/5 low progesterone.	0.6629844265703129
Controls (n=11, HIV+ without KS) showed a clear trend for higher serum levels of sexual hormones, but the difference was not significant.	0.7204499316217736
Although different reasons for low levels of oestrogens (drug abuse, marasmus, menopause) must be considered, the lack of oestrogens seems to be a common finding in HIV+ and HIV- women with KS.	0.646385355245219
There was no correlation between sexual practices (anal or oral-faecal contacts) and the manifestation or aggressiveness of KS.	0.6129623089407806
The aim of the study was the assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function and left ventricular mass following aortic valve replacement (AVR) due to aortic valve stenosis as well as the influence of regression of LV hypertrophy in patients with normal and impaired LV systolic function prior to surgery.	0.6845556176426032
74 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (29 female, 45 male, mean age 66  +/-  18 years) were divided into 2 groups according to LV ejection fraction (EF): Group 1 with EF > 50% (n = 40); Group 2 with EF <= 50% (n = 34).	0.8026055576555131
Furthermore, patients were differentiated into a group A without (n = 53) and a group B with aortic regurgitation (<= II °, n = 21).	0.8266199261203312
All patients were examined by transthoracic echocardiography before and 1 month after surgery.	0.8804064079103994
There was a significant decrease of LV enddiastolic and endsystolic valume indices following AVR in group 2 and group B.	0.6185425514316127
Patients with preoperatively lower EF (group 2) showed an increase in LV ejection fraction from 39  +/-  10% before AVR to 47  +/-  11% after AVR (p < 0.001), whereas patients with preoperative normal EF (group 1) showed a significant decrease in EF (from 62  +/-  8% to 57  +/-  10%, p < 0.05).	0.7578066002476357
Also patients with combined aortic valve disease before AVR had an increase of EF after surgery (from 45 %plusmn; 14% to 56  +/-  14%, p < 0.03).	0.6481718600903389
There were significant decreases of interventricular septum thickness and LV posterior wall thickness in group 1 and group A, whereas a significant decrease of LV anddiastolic diameter index was noted only in group B.	0.6330572622955591
Improvement of the NYHA functional class could be demonstrated in group 2 from 2.8  +/-  0.7 before to 2.2  +/-  0.6 after AVR, as well as in group B from 2.9  +/-  0.7 before to 1.9  +/-  0.7 after surgery.	0.8761439511122365
In conclusion, patients with impaired LV function or combined aortic valve disease showed a significant improvement of left ventricular systolic function after AVR, while patients with normal LV function presented a slight decrease of EF.	0.7357249861231367
There was a significant regression of left ventricular muscle mass in all groups independent of the left ventricular functional status.	0.8685291660823105
Cardiomyocytes lose the ability to proliferate after birth.	0.2787334382010088
Subsequently, irreversible cellular damage, e.g., during myocardial infarction, causes loss of functional properties and cell replacement by fibrotic tissue.	0.5531192584743057
It is, therefore, not surprising that cell replacement strategies such as cardiomyocyte transplantation in damaged myocardium or scar tissue has gained widespread interest.	0.4497257116458609
In other species such as mice, rats, and dogs, the technical feasibility of skeletal myoblast-, satellite cell-, and fetal cardiomyocyte engraftment into normal and diseased myocardium has been demonstrated by simple injection methods.	0.5977087803601849
Repeatedly, it has been shown that transplanted cells may survive for weeks within host myocardium and build intercellular connections such as grap junctions and desmosomes.	0.5551650817911138
In contrast, grafthost connections have not, as yet, been convincingly demonstrated.	0.5161635904312152
Hypothetically, cell transplants might exhibit the following functional properties: stabilization of diseased tissue to prevent structural remodeling; carrier for recombinant proteins, growth factors or drugs to induce molecular alterations of host myocardium; and improvement of regional and global myocardial function due to active contractility.	0.48725314932279906
However, clear evidence of coordinated contractility of transplanted cells, and, thus, of a clinically relevant therapeutical use of cardiomyocyte transplantation as a replacement strategy for damaged host cardiac cells, remains to be demonstrated.	0.6478627138060715
Concomitant with advances in medicine, involving the development and use of antibiotics, immunosuppressive drugs, organ / stem cell transplantation and pre-existing illnesses such as AIDS, the frequency of fungal infection has increased dramatically.	0.6760977524508104
These factors determine the susceptibility of the lung for an acute or chronic course of disease.	0.6151105968598919
Purpose: We evaluated the speed of sound (SOS) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) at the os calcis as an indicator of osteoporosis and observed the age-related changes in ultrasound values in normal women.	0.712157124712096
Materials and methods: BUA and SOS were measured in 236 women using the "Achilles" densitometer (Lunar, Madison, Ohio).	0.38993220792022637
From the BUA and SOS values the BUA/SOS Index ("Stiffness" Index) is calculated.	0.5795807506257292
We investigated 55 female patients with osteoporosis (aged 43-85 years) and 181 healthy women (aged 20-80 years).	0.6667124976419678
Results: Ultrasound values for women with osteoporosis were significantly lower than those for the normal control group.	0.6239786740228033
The Z-score compared with young normals was higher for the BUA/SOS Index (-3.1) than for BUA (-2.5) and SOS (-3.0).	0.9079692826139845
At a BUA/SOS Index of 68 the sensitivity was 85 %, and the specificity was 77 % for patients with osteoporotic fractures.	0.7707928558156425
We found a significant decline with age in SOS (r = -0.55), BUA (r = -0.50) and BUA/SOS Index (r = -0.57).	0.4666809536711403
Conclusion: Ultrasound bone densitometry at the os calcis can be used as a screening test in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.	0.6556016778533772
A treatment procedure requires the consent of the patient, but this is legally effective only if he is capable of giving his consent and can be informed accordingly.	0.6086281163199249
Because of demographic development and the progress of medicine, the number of patients who are not able to give their consent is increasing.	0.7592270991264516
In practice, we make do with the presumed consent of the patient or, for procedures that can wait, with the consent of legitimate family members.	0.7857987732249312
An initiative action is suggested by physicians and hospitals that should reduce this gray zone and the forensic risks drastically.	0.4268827352873957
A number of studies has shown a significant relationship between life events/life conditions and depression.	0.5602644886941204
However, there is only a small number of studies investigating the effect of life events/life conditions in patients with severe depression from the endogenous subtype.	0.7621732660688566
The present study examines the significance of the patients' life events/life conditions for the two year outcome of the illness in a prospective study with assessments every three months.	0.845943207339237
Patients are compared to healthy controls with regard to the period three months prior to the admission to the hospital at the index episode.	0.6532181663907453
The results confirm the importance of life events and life conditions for the long term outcome of depressed patients with endogenous subtype respectively severe major depression in-patients.	0.6938826420429459
Relapsers show considerably more undesirable life conditions than non-relapsers three to six months prior to their relapse.	0.4429405786844877
Depressed patients indicate significantly more undesirable life events and life conditions and fewer desirable life conditions in comparison to the control group for the time span three months prior to their hospitalisation.	0.5907055707475104
Since the availability of protease inhibitors in 1997, there has been a great change in antiretroviral therapy but also new long term side effects have emerged, mainly metabolic changes such as hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterinemia and hyperglycemia.	0.5589477582727683
Besides, fat redistribution has been observed.	0.26830417461022493
Fat wastes in the face and limbs but accumulates in the adipose tissue of the dorsocervical and abdominal region and the breasts.	0.49979631775832134
The mechanism of these changes remains unclear.	0.5633833999024218
For therapy a protease inhibitor free therapy or lipid lowering drugs may be tried.	0.40019196724447803
29 of our 224 patients developed lipodystrophy.	0.3101403334594655
27 of these patients had been treated with a protease inhibitor (17 patients with indinavir); 2 of the patients had never received protease inhibitors.	0.940954888531304
Background: The Low-Vision-Enhancement-System (LVESR) is the first binocular optoelectronic rehabilitation device with variable focus distance.	0.7464283085302519
DNA-cytophotometry is one of the methods that may contribute to a more precise evaluation of the biological behaviour of tumours in addition to the WHO-classification.	0.8292720181277321
In this study 121 tumour specimens of 50 patients suffering from gliomas with one or up to three recurrencies were investigated.	0.5964487080777582
In all cases the histological type and WHO-grade and the Ki-67/MIB1 labeling index were determined.	0.5698911318527174
DNA cytophotometry was performed after single cell preparation on Feulgen-stained preparations, and the following parameters were calculated: stemline ploidy, 5c-exceeding rate, and 2c-deviation index.	0.5889790050922283
There is a world-wide renaissance of neurosurgical treatments of Parkinson's disease (PD), based on substantial progress in basic sciences.	0.429331654619618
A model of parallel motor circuitry has identified potential targets for lesioning by clarifying the pathophysiological role of the basal ganglia in PD.	0.4826927068585436
The internal globus pallidus (Gpi) is an essential player as it connects to thalamocortical projections and can be disinhibited by overactivity of the nucleus subthalamicus (Nst).	0.5671110885132182
Lesioning of these targets has been successful in MPTP damaged primates.	0.28085374014872155
There is clinical use of destructive as well as restorative and stimulative technics.	0.4370457567646155
Pallidotomy and thalamatomy have evolved by the use of better neuroradiological and electrophysiological targeting.	0.3228974951710615
The first technic is used for treatment of rigidity, hypokinesia and dyskinesias, the latter one has proven to be efficient for tremor.	0.6722681269459644
Dopaminergic reinnervation and increased dopaminergic output of the striatum has only been seen after transplantation of fetal cells; this method however carries immunological and ethical problems.	0.5465120701930449
The continuous high frequency stimulation of basal ganglia is the newest technic; it is highly adaptable to the patient's need and carries a low morbidity profile.	0.6346298586136663
Thalamic stimulation is used for the treatment of tremor.	0.6147218160427205
The stimulation of Nst and Gpi are proposed for dyskinesias and on/off phenomena.	0.30491974296605917
Animal research further focuses on xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent precursor cells.	0.335840268440265
- In summary neurosurgical procedures seem to be verey promising; however longterm comparison studies are needed to define the best (combination) treatment(s) for the future.	0.7061155654823105
Concepts of documentation rely not only on the contents required and technical demands, but the procedures covered and in medical applications especially security aspects are also matters of critical concern.	0.580597813499348
Even though the need for effective documentation (i.e., adequate in content, availability, feasibility and easy to retrieve analysis) is not a question, tasks and aims (for example, quality of patient care) deserve attention and establishing efforts have to be analyzed regarding their structural and personal prerequisites and implications before particular tools for documentation can be developed.	0.6085736105576448
The Medtronic Thera/Thera-i (and Kappa 400) pacemakers utilize a mode switching algorithm that switches from the DDD/R mode to the DDIR mode in the presence on an atrial tachyarrhythmia.	0.45640652464995746
To accomplish this, the pacemaker keeps track of a mean atrial rate (MAR) which is a weighted index of the atrial rate.	0.7631316883857301
Once the MAR is greater than the programmed mode switch rate the pacemaker mode switches to the nontracking mode.	0.3458540384321328
Because the algorithm weights faster atrial rates more heavily than slow atrial rates, the algorithm is sensitive to a wide variety of atrial tachyarrhythmias, including those with varying amplitudes.	0.6405297504959503
Additionally, the algorithm provides a long PVARP and a rate adaptive (RA) AV interval.	0.48309462954559473
These not only help ensure that a wide range of atrial rates will be detected, but may also limit the time the patient tracks at the upper rate before mode switching.	0.5959149597802313
In order to assess the effectiveness of the algorithm, the Thera-i provides detailed diagnostics which provide information on the date, time, duration, and rate of the mode switch episodes.	0.7607007810065534
Additionally, more detailed beat-to-beat information is provided for each episode which can help determine its appropriateness and can assist in making programming changes.	0.5605039182000845
There is a lot of information in the literature about psychological disturbances in somatic diseases.	0.7432951514717326
For dermatological patients such data are not available.	0.4404134105354917
In early spring 1998 we studied the psychological changes in 247 hospitalized patients in the dermatological department of the Ruhr University Bochum.	0.5371293900653968
We used the German version of the internationally accepted Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.	0.4523305266450578
We found the prevalance of psychological alterations ranged between 25,9% and 31%.	0.6262925211476521
The prevalence of psychological disturbances was a little higher than that seen in oncological, cardiological or neurological patient populations.	0.4958167107337342
Surprisingly skin cancer patients were less affected than patients with chronic inflammatory or angiological diseases.	0.5890945555586644
These results underline the necessity of improved psychological therapeutical strategies which must be standardized and evaluated.	0.375063261619632
In an analysis of 3,838 restrained car drivers, the proportion of acceleration related injury of the cervical spine increased from under 10 % in 1985 to over 30 % in 1997.	0.7571746915457476
These injuries occurred mainly in the case of head-on or multiple collisions.	0.47296166384101496
Letters were sent to 1,136 of the injured persons, and of the 138 patients who returned the questionnaires, 121 (88 %) were still suffering from their symptoms.	0.7070832690912472
It was a question of pain (74 %), tension (6 %) and stiffness (5 %) in the head (27 %), neck (55 %) and shoulder (8 %) area.	0.8593212987395823
The duration of the complaints was the longest after multiple collisions.	0.48265173750127094
In addition to a slight influence of the accompanying injuries on the duration of complaints, the individual constitution seems to be an important determining factor.	0.8880498287901132
In order to resolve the difficulties of conducting of this retrospective study, prospective studies are necessary which include documentation of diagnosis, treatment protocols, duration and type of complaints.	0.6377957663477783
Large B-cell neoplasms represent one of the most frequent groups of non-Hodgkin-lymphomas (30-40%).	0.6906021329255552
They are characterised by an aggressive clinical course.	0.4412945862083136
These lymphomas may evolve either de novo or secondary during the course of a less aggressive lymphoma.	0.3981718534365368
In addition to primary nodal, a primary extranodal manifestation is rather common.	0.6738376460402687
The neoplastic cells, even within one given case, show a broad morphological spectrum.	0.6380722955420757
Several findings of the last two decades have revealed that the large B-cell lymphomas represent an inhomogeneous group.	0.7425375159443364
This fact has been taken into account by the new WHO classification of malignant lymphomas.	0.5874312198688694
There are two groups identified, that of the variants and that of the subtypes.	0.8546784883091346
The various variants (centroblastic, immunoblastic, anaplastic, T-cell/histiocyte-rich) correspond to lymphomas without reproducible discriminating criteria lacking characteristic clinical, immunophenotypical and genetic findings.	0.42173802817187367
In contrast, the primary mediastinal, the intravascular, the primary effusion and primary central nervous system lymphomas represent distinct disease entities.	0.6944117709237555
A number of recently described large cell lymphoma types, i. e. plasmablastic, ALK-positive and primary gastric, are included in the classification, their designation as distinct entities is still under discussion.	0.6461355809542337
In the presented study, knee joint proprioception of 43 patients with a patellar pain syndrome of the knee joint was evaluated.	0.764684175352687
In a control group, the proprioception of 30 healthy volunteers with clinical and anamnestic inconspicous knee joints was examined.	0.5710449581252196
We tested the proprioceptive capability of the subjects with a passive angle reproduction test.	0.41872534249978355
Additionally, all knee joints were measured with and without an elastic knee bandage.	0.6313802586192153
The patient group showed significant deterioration of angle reproduction capability (13.2  °  +/-  6.1  °) compared to the control group (7.8  °  +/-  2.8  °).	0.8695968392551996
After applying an elastic knee bandage, the angle reproduction capability significantly improved to 9.2  °  +/-  4.5  °.	0.8525312861583673
Proprioception of the contralateral, noninvolved knee joint in the patients (11.6  °  +/-  6.3  °) was worse compared to the control group.	0.9271789819949823
Applying an elastic knee bandage did not significantly improve the proprioception of the uninjured knee joint.	0.46191829668347484
Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained arrhythmia in men.	0.7565884308354814
It is associated with a two-fold mortality risk and an increased cost for health care providers.	0.6378274484493877
The relative inefficacy and the risks of pharmacologic approaches to atrial fibrillation therapy have contributed to increasing efforts to address atrial fibrillation with curative ablative strategies.	0.4676975919972555
Ablation approaches for atrial fibrillation focus on two alternate strategies: ablation of the substrate for initiation and ablation of the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation.	0.45325841923308424
It has been demonstrated that atrial fibrillation may be initiated by repetitive atrial premature beats originating from a single focus.	0.6872529542281572
These ectopic foci can be mapped and ablated, thereby removing the substrate for initiation of atrial fibrillation.	0.4379523844415152
Most often, these atrial premature beats arise from the pulmonary veins.	0.7110383404967316
A challenge in trying to ablate the trigger is actually having enough spontaneous activity from the said focus throughout the electrophysiologic study.	0.3479194642023434
To sidestep the need of mapping, pure anatomic approaches are currently under investigation to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins from the atrial myocardium by circumferential lesions.	0.4858367547859632
In patients without a defined trigger for atrial fibrillation, efforts were made to ablate the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation.	0.5744626896096415
Strong evidence exists that atrial fibrillation is the result of multiple coexisting reentrant wavelets requiring a critical myocardial mass to perpetuate.	0.4721298503898298
Several working groups demonstrated that intraoperative compartmentalization of the myocardial tissue by surgical incisions or radiofrequency pulses is highly effective in preventing atrial fibrillation.	0.3871059386196658
Currently, attempts were made to reproduce the surgical technique using transveneous, catheter-based approaches.	0.5682864849686007
Though our knowledge of ablation techniques and technical prerequisites is continuously increasing, the difficulty to produce complete linear lesions in the left atrium and local thrombus formation at the ablation line are problems that are still not solved.	0.6364911911912517
Using a time-budget method in a 3 year longitudinal study with a control group design, substantial reductions in the engagement of non-obligatory instrumental, social, and leisure activities could be found in a group of mildly to moderately demented patients.	0.6122908054894141
Controlling these changes for differences in baseline paramters, the dementia-specific reduction was about 1,5 hours compared to a non-psychiatric control group.	0.593874691041096
These clinically relevant changes in activity levels underscore the importance of these activity domains with regard to the development of diagnostically useful indicators at the early stages of dementia.	0.48777550758850907
Time-budget methods seem to be particularly useful to close the diagnostic gap with regard to the assessment of everyday competence indicators especially at early stages of the dementia illness.	0.6174306125156579
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease with different etiological, morphological, functional, clinical and therapeutic aspects.	0.778119048852201
Recent investigations indicate that HCM is considerably widespread in the population (1:500).	0.6148339691356902
The causes seem to generate from familial or sporadic abnormalities (mutations).	0.36325577974944195
Depending on the clinical aspect, the complaints, and on the basis of morphologic and hemodynamic investigational results, we mainly have to consider two types of medical and surgical management.	0.8102992863917979
Atrial fibrillation is in 20-50% the most frequent dysrhythmia after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and a possible cause for hemodynamical complications and prolongation off the medical treatment in patients.	0.842773272731107
Therefore, the effect of -blocking with metoprolol for prevention of supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA) was investigated in a prospective and randomized trial.	0.8506604258313918
200 patients after CABG were randomized in a drug and control group (average age 63.2 years, 154 male, 46 female).	0.5867749426091255
Patients of the drug group (n=100) were treated with metoprolol (1mg/kg/BW) beginning on day one after operation, whereas patients of the control group (n=100) received therapy only in case of occurrence of atrial fibrillaton.	0.7097300079606295
ECG, blood pressure, and electrolyte concentrations were measured regulary until the tenth day after surgery.	0.5959855409973371
Reasons for exclusion were an ejection fraction (< 30%, SA- and AV-block or simultaneous application of epinephrine and metoprolol.	0.6804834044500951
There were no significant differences between the patients of drug and control group with respect to age, sex ejection fraction, previous medication, number and type of bypass grafts, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and perioperative ischemic events.	0.7598231661203156
However, a statistically significant difference was seen in the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias in both groups, 4 patients of the therapy group (4%) in contrast to 37 patients of the control (37%) developed supraventricular arrhythmias during the postoperative observation period (p<0.0001).	0.8890226821876485
Both groups differed in total time of hospital stay by 1.5 days (control group: 9.83 +/- 2.88 days; drug group: 8.42 +/- 2.81 days), which was statistically significant (p<0.05).	0.7140972359822793
All patients of the drug group could be discharged with a stable sinusrhythm, whereas 7 patients of the control group were discharged with persistent atrial fibrillation.	0.7584718858383732
The difference was statistically significant as well (p<0.01).	0.42918539295908664
Neither typical side effects of metoprolol, nor AV-blocks, bradycardia (f<60/min) or symptoms of low blood pressure could be observed.	0.5901617439920835
The conclusion of this trial is a recommendation for a preventive application of 50mg metoprolol/day after coronary artery bypass surgery, which can reduce the incidence of SVA as well as the hospital stay statistically significant.	0.6954680891704732
Especially by using the "Functional Muscular Diagnostics" described by Janda specific muscular imbalances can be found.	0.5158040069152621

Background: Angiotensin converting  enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) alter the function of the renin-angiotensin-aldesterone-system, which regulates the angiotensin II synthesis.	0.5313368359851343
Angiotensine II is known to be a potent vasoconstrictor.	0.7638579546575108
ACE-inhibitors are used as a standard treatment of arterial hypertension concerning the WHO-guidelines.	0.7962913387135677

Evoked potentials (EP) are a valuable tool when assessment of neurocritical care patients is impaired by loss of consciousness and lack of co-operation.	0.6702201650416736
Different modalities of short latency EP can be applied to evaluate sensory, auditory and visual systems.	0.51312923033581
In this review we discuss EP studies in patients with thrombosis of basilar artery, space occupying cerebellar infarction and supratentorial mass lesions of different aetiology.	0.5052509315350305
Paclitaxel, a potent anti-tumor agent, shifts the cytoskeleton equilibrium towards assembly of altered and extraordinarily stable microtubules.	0.4247857676417833
These cellular modifications lead to reduced proliferation, migration, and signal transduction.	0.5731866832787217
It is highly lipophilic, which promotes a rapid cellular uptake, and has a long-lasting effect in the cell due to the structural alteration of the cytoskeleton.	0.9069586966061451
This makes paclitaxel a promising candidate for local drug delivery intended to address the proliferative and migratory processes involved in restenosis.	0.3914277190122542
In this article, results of our in vitro and in vivo studies with paclitaxel are presented.	0.6639453170928915
Cell culture experiments with monocultures of human arterial smooth muscle cells as well as cocultures with human endothelial cells showed that paclitaxel leads to an almost complete growth inhibition within a dose range of 1.0-10.0µmol/l, even after a short (20 min) single dose application.	0.6942361751127396
The comparison of an active, semi-active, and passive delivery system (porous balloon, microporous balloon, and double balloon) favored the double balloon for the following in vivo experiments.	0.623116249364011
Tubulin staining and electron microscopy enabled visualization of paclitaxel-induced vessel wall alterations.	0.3656266564527854
In the rabbit model, locally delivered paclitaxel resulted in reduced neointima formation and enlargement in vessel size; in the pig model, however, after stenting, this inhibition was not significant.	0.5770919814767026
Both reduced proliferation and enlargement in vessel size contribute to a preservation of vessel shape and are likely to be caused by a structural alteration of the cytoskeleton, which is also supported by vascular contraction force experiments.	0.6392384467257559
Atopic eczema is one of the most frequent dermatological diseases, with a still increasing incidence.	0.7731108610344921
Although its etiopathogenesis is still not completely understood, a variety of triggering factors are known.	0.6268917432608654
The following case report describes the clinical course of atopic dermatitis in a 2-year-old boy in whom both IgE-mediated allergic reactions and psychological factors were involved in triggering and maintenance of skin lesions.	0.6753323193047631
This demonstrates how important both dermatological therapy and close cooperation with the field of psychosomatic medicine can be.	0.49605811361629515
Identity development in adolescence may act as stressor triggering juvenile psychotic episodes.	0.2688386442043406
A model is being presented stating that self development in subjects with high vulnerability for psychosis leads to the establishment of an "imaginary self" consisting of phantasies and fictions without taking into account facts and social realities.	0.463612043587701
The "imaginary self" stabilizes irritating self deficiencies, thus leading to a vulnerability for depersonalisation and identity diffusion during actual turmoils of adaptation.	0.4349244871879499
Biomaterials are defined as non-living materials which are used in interaction with biological systems.	0.5108013560302198
Especially in the field of urology, biomaterials are applied in urinary diversion, urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and as cosmetic prostheses.	0.6312666680194118
Biomaterial-tissue interaction is caused by the physical and chemical characteristics of the biomaterial, its degradation, and the resulting protein denaturation.	0.8255530636467635
General requirements include biocompatibility and functionality and the avoidance of carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic, and allergic reactions.	0.4859918735458621
This ist most important when there is permanent contact between urine and epithelial tissue, which may lead to biofilminfection and incrustation.	0.5821963867619085
Continuous modification of known materials, inauguration of new materials, as well as the possibilities of tissue engineering will determine their development in the years to come.	0.6076374520736575
Hitherto the question of an indication for psychoanalytic group psychotherapy has not been clarified sufficiently.	0.6734846698900419
In this paper, under the premise, that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy is a treatment mode in its own right, the issue is investigated which patients might best profit from the group treatment method.	0.6143726375807095
It is pointed out that the group process itself contains a variety of therapeutic treatment factors which cannot be facilitated through psychoanalytic treatment of just one patient.	0.4202255911187333
First, a series of diagnostic, structural, motivational and cognitive indication criteria are discussed.	0.5697673174537559
Second, the moments of a capacity for cohesion and aspects of social relatedness are considered as helpful tools for a formulation of an indication.	0.5280586518666225
As cohesion - according to group treatment outcome research results - has to be viewed as correspondent to the helpful therapeutic alliance, in the context of group psychotherapy, the quest for indication is inextricably linked to patient selection and setting conditions.	0.6646588148665942
The conclusion is that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy, would preferably be indicated for those patients who suffer from constraints of emotional competence as stemming from developmental deficits.	0.4815140927062902
Purpose: To evaluate method- and user effects as well as the required time in the determination of left- and right ventricular ejection fractions in comparing manual and semiautomatic border detection of the endocardium.	0.7530277143675211
The diagnosis of urinary tract infection in renal transplant patients is important because unrecognized bacterial infection may lead - in the worst case - to graft loss.	0.7963149931394652
Between January 1995 and January 1997, we therefore obtained bladder catheter urine samples in 31 female allograft recipients when voided urine samples repeatedly showed pyuria (>=10 WC per microscope field (x40)) and significant bacteriuria (>=;105/ml) combined with vaginal contamination (plenty of squamous epithelial cells, mixed bacterial growth).	0.6132457694792108
Results: In 55 % (17/31), diagnosis of urinary tract infection was confirmed by single bladder catheterization; in 26 % (8/31), urinary tract infection could be excluded, and in 19 % (6/31), bladder colonization without pyuria was found.	0.8569644504767429
Thus, 45 % of the patients with abnormal voided urine samples did not need antimicrobials.	0.825365998255897
After single dose antibiotic therapy with 500 mg Ciprofloxacin, given immediately after catheterization, no infectious complications occurred.	0.542235228361814
Diagnostic single bladder catheterization is a simple, safe and - compared to suprapubic aspiration - barely invasive method for the diagnosis or exclusion of urinary tract infection in female renal transplant patients with higher risk for complications due to an acute bladder infection and non-conclusive voided urine samples.	0.7124782502373386
Most people with the Metabolic Syndrome die from thrombotic complications superimposed to degenerative arterial vascular lesions, mostly myocardial infarction.	0.4439705420200996
Type-2-Diabetes is a risk factor per se for such complications, but often clusters with dyslipoproteinemia, hypertension and obesity.	0.6883933409717202
This is referred to as "Metabolic Syndrome" and often operates on a genetically programmed susceptibility which accelerates the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease in front of a much wider diabetes specific cardiopathy.	0.6230199036605105
From a pathophysiological point of view none of these associated risk factors explains the pathogenetic series of events leading to the precipitation of an occlusive thrombus at sites of complicated coronary plaques.	0.49226845594773794
In patients with the Metabolic Syndrome the coagulation system is switched towards a prethrombotic state, involving increased plasmatic coagulation, diminished fibrinolysis, decreased endothelial thromboresistance and predominantly platelet hyperreactivity ("diabetic thrombocytopathy").	0.5472826134108492
Some of these factors are associated with an increased coronary risk (e.g.	0.6270120816734738
fibrinogen, PAI-1, platelets), but are also directly linked to the pathogenesis of "atherothrombosis".	0.6561604863252084
Altered cardiac remodelling together with adhesion and coagulation mechanisms appears suitable to explain decreased functional performance of infarcted organs, decreased success of acute (reduced fibrinolytic response, no reflow phenomenon) and longterm intervention strategies for vessel patency (PTCA, CABG) in Diabetes.	0.5976307564355788
Glucose adjustment alone will not adequately neutralize these complex mechanisms, but in the situation of myocardial infarction eumetabolization with parenteral glucose-insulin-potassium infusion appears mandatory similar to non-diabetics.	0.581175953435205
On the longterm a multidimensional interventional repertoire is required particularly in patients with the Metabolic Syndrome including antihypertensive, antidyslipoproteinemic and antithrombotic drugs, customized according to the individual patients needs as assessed by early diagnostic measures ("early secondary prevention").	0.6009133223126157
The indication for operative treatment in spondylolisthesis results from pain, progressive sliding and, in up to 60 % of the patients with progressive dislocation, from radicular malfunction.	0.8719658758316773
The posterolateral fusion in situ is a safe procedure, but the deformation remains and in spondyloptosis plastic deformation of the fusion mass can lead to further dislocation.	0.6589523869151265
With the external fixator as an instrument for reduction and the internal fixator for stabilization the reduction of even serious spondyloptosis and the recovery of a normal spine alignement and posture is possible, with an acceptable neurological risk.	0.6972498583041089
Therefore a concept of treatment is suggested, which as a rule is aiming at the anatomical reduction of the dislocated vertrebra beside stabilization and nerveroot decompression.	0.6797228101280645
Depending on the extent of the slip, reduction and stabilization is to be performed in one, two or three stages.	0.9116727825105251
An anterior or posterior fusion is sufficient in grade I dislocation.	0.46307120363593074
In grade II-V a combined posterior and anterior surgical proceedure is recommended.	0.42127766623433954
Objectives: This study was conducted to evaluate a modified technique of interskalene brachial plexus anaesthesia (ISB) and postoperative catheter analgesia for shoulder surgery.	0.7241275171208797
The original method described by Winnie bears some rare but life-threatening complications (inadvertent subarachnoid or intra-arterial injection, pneumothorax).	0.5060126060123108
Objectives: Due to its low solubility and negligible metabolism, desflurane is assumed to be especially suitable for application by low-flow anaesthetic techniques.	0.6238694894889254
The aim of this clinical investigation was the development of a standardised dosing scheme for low-flow and minimal-flow desflurane anaesthesia.	0.7845340429856519
Methods: One hundred six ASA status I-II patients were assigned to six groups according to the duration of the initial high-flow phase, fresh gas flow, and fresh-gas desflurane concentration.	0.7107687076047748
The median age, height, body weight, and constitution of the groups was comparable.	0.6788096295135564
After an initial high-flow phase using 4.4 l/min, the fresh gas flow was reduced to 0.5 l/min (minimal-flow anaesthesia) or 1.0 l/min (low-flow anaesthesia).	0.8301743099101675
Inspired nitrous oxide concentrations were maintained at 60% to 70%.	0.5704058305364696
Using different standardised schemes of vaporizer settings, inspired desflurane concentrations were applied in the range from 3.4% to 8.7%, i.e., between 1 and 1.5 MAC.	0.8045065183330493
Inspired and expired desflurane concentrations were measured continuously by the side-stream technique and recorded on-line.	0.5161406280122707
Venous blood samples were taken immediately prior to induction and 45 min after flow reduction for measurement of carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) concentration).	0.44213952494568903
Results: In the 10- to 15-min initial phase during which a high fresh gas flow of 4.4 l/min was used, the inspired desflurane concentration reached values in the range of 90%-95% of the fresh gas concentration.	0.8273811896092145
In low-flow anaesthesia this concentration could be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting, whereas in minimal-flow anaesthesia with flow reduction the fresh gas concentration had to be increased by 1% to 2%: The quotient calculated by division of the inspired desflurane concentration by its fresh gas concentration (Q=CI/CF) ranges between 0.65 and 0.75 in minimal-flow and between 0.80 and 0.85 in low-flow anaesthesia.	0.7657345794139689
If use was made of the wide output range of the desflurane vaporizer, the inspired concentration could be increased rapidly by about 5% in 8 min, although the flow was kept constant at 0.5 l/min.	0.7131325435532588
Compared with its value prior to induction (2.13 +/- 1.05%), the COHb concentration decreased statistically significantly by about 0.7% during the 1st hour of minimal-flow anaesthesia (1.42 +/- 1.01%).	0.7428274690849556
In no case was a COHb concentration observed that exceeded threatening or even toxic values, although the soda lime was changed routinely only once a week.	0.5024519045816016
Conclusions: The pharmacokinetic properties of desflurane, resulting in especially low individual uptake, and the wide output range of the vaporizer facilitate the use of low-flow anaesthetic techniques in routine clinical practice.	0.6814053511788949
Even in minimal-flow anaesthesia, the duration of the initial high-flow phase can be shortened to min.	0.6352090545397068
If the flow is reduced to 1 l/min, the inspired desflurane concentration achieved in the initial high-flow phase can be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting.	0.6128810227607837
In minimal-flow anaesthesia, however, with flow reduction to 0.5 l/min, the fresh gas concentration has to be increased to a value 1%-2% higher than the inspired nominal value.	0.8053945945809138
Due to the wide dialling range of the desflurane vaporizer, the amount of vapour delivered into the breathing system can be increased to about 110 ml/min even at a flow of 0.5 l/min.	0.6543186953486433
The large amount of agent that can be delivered into the system even under low-flow conditions, together with the very low individual uptake, results in a time-constant that is sufficiently short for the clinically required rapid increase in inspired desflurane concentrations.	0.625571107133547
The short time-constant of low-flow desflurane anaesthesia improves the control of the anaesthetic concentration.	0.7296540344122233
If all measures are taken to safely avoid inadvertent drying out of the soda lime, there is no evidence that low-flow anaesthesia with desflurane is liable to increase the risk of accidental ca	0.6880281113309359
Arterial port systems are frequently used in the adjuvant and palliative therapy of colorectal hepatic metastasis.	0.5770825770648499

Background: Coenesthesias can be defined as disorders of body perception or body hallucinations, projected in different parts of the body.	0.5160080128502041
Patients complain of intractable pain or dysesthesia.	0.27308701413137676
These symptoms are reported even from organs where we usually have no perception.	0.395597511881312
Coenesthesia must be regarded as a symptom that can be observed in various psychiatric diseases, e.g., schizophrenia.	0.613838343043464
However, in rare cases coenesthesias can be documented in neurological diseases, e.g., intracranial tumors or infections.	0.5920029911533973
Therefore, accurate assessment of possible differential diagnoses is important.	0.5694268907922002
In late stages, coenesthesias can easily be recognized because of their "bizarre" character.	0.501989543405668

Studies on the everyday life of the elderly often deal with visible behavior.	0.583230179311907
In this study, the subjective experience of the everyday living environment was investigated, paying special consideration to the role of mobility impairment.	0.658826731058105
Two approaches, one oriented toward the subject's experience of the home environment, another oriented toward the environmental specifics of the individual's favorite place, were employed.	0.6447758633755373
Is the experience of living at home different for individuals with various levelsults were found in the experience of cognitive, biographical, and spatial dimensions of the living environment.	0.6559832984052738
Similarities were found in the experience of emotional, social, and behavioral dimensions of one's home.	0.7183719295472135
Competence loss played an important role in how the subjects experienced living at home, yet even the mobility impaired experienced their home as a environment which could be shaped.	0.5129861568995605
The environment-oriented approach showed that the favorite place of mobility impaired persons was characterized by higher spatial density.	0.5444989328914032
Finally, an examination of four home environment profiles using cluster analysis illustrated the connection between both person- and environment-oriented approaches and offered insights into a transactional perspective of person and environment.	0.5293723362827041
Even though the subjective experience of one's home environment is not easily quantifiable in terms of maintaining everyday competence, it nonetheless imparts meaning to the elderly person's daily life.	0.5497484363040249
The main advantage of the bilateral medial rectus faden operation (posterior fixation suture) for the treatment of essential infantile esotropia is the low occurrence of delayed consecutive exotropia.	0.5599849887188141

Molecular and epidemiological studies have confirmed that human pathogenic papillomaviruses (HPV)types 16 and 18 are causally involved in the developement of carcinoma of the cervix.	0.4797268431613097
This statement is also true, albeit with reservations as yet, of other so-called high-risk HPV types, such as HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56 and 58.	0.6591964652456004
Around 500,000 women throughout the world become ill with carcinoma of the cervix every year, and 1-4% of all younger women have a precancer of the cervix uteri.	0.8138352565109288
This knowledge of the viral origin of anogenital neoplasms has not yet been exploited for primary and secondary prevention of these illnesses, however.	0.678305106238035
This is mainly because infection with genital HPV types is very prevalent in young women but seldom leads to carcinoma.	0.36052446313125364
In this review, therefore, the most important epidemiological data available on cervical carcinoma and its preliminary stages are analysed with reference to an association with HPV.	0.6691772837882629
In addition, the molecular biological data on HPV as it relates to anogenital carcinogenesis are presented.	0.46855320813989165

After successful angioplasty it was possible to reestablish stable sinus rhythm by single defibrillation.	0.48856484009204326
By use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) the flow rate of pCPS was reduced every two hours.	0.5363473602299932
After 10 hours of support pCPS was explaned.	0.3187507168097273
IABP was needed for three days.	0.27727712254878967
The patient was discharged from hospital without any relevant neurological deficits after nine weeks.	0.5718293220562846
By using pCPS it is possible to stabilize the patient's hemodynamic situation and to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures if other means of resuscitation do not suffice.	0.6460928869758491
The use of pCPS in resuscitation is indicated in circulatory arrest if further therapeutic options seem promising.	0.4527322185812028
Defects of the frontoorbital complex subsequent to extensive tumor surgery or severe trauma often result in aesthetic and functional disharmonies.	0.4592589201163823
The long-term results of rehabilitation related to different materials and techniques are the subject of this study.	0.8128168471593374
From 1974 to 1996 altogether 127 patients with bony defects of the orbit and/or the skull base underwent surgery.	0.6878421504380445
All patients' data were documented prospectively from 1984 onwards.	0.3611511686775877
The results following reconstruction with autologous calvarian transplants in 52 patients were compared to those of a control group which received iliac bone or PMMA implants.	0.6177700272564685
Eighty-one bony defects (64%) resulted from tumor resection; 37 patients (29%) suffered from the effects of trauma.	0.5944344445449646
In 67 cases (53%) reconstruction was performed primarily, in 51 cases (40%) secondarily.	0.694735559389593
Free or pedicled soft-tissue transplants were necessary in order to separate the orbit and the neurocranium in 26% of the defects.	0.5788311106358003
On the other hand, small, isolated defects of the orbital roof (7%) were left without any reconstructive procedure.	0.759869782661712
Contrary to the iliac bone grafts, the calvarian transplants resisted secondary resorption.	0.5111681210376117
Postoperative infections appeared in two cases; loss of transplants was avoided entirely in the group of calvarian reconstructions in contrast to the alloplasts.	0.604554017117668
The selection of a suitable donor site area and rigid fixation with microplates led to excellent esthetic results even in cases with large defects.	0.5809750515724069
Within inpatient psychotherapy traditionally different therapeutic approaches are combined.	0.4123659406569441
Usually verbal interventions of different orientations and settings (e.g.	0.22522155816120407
individual and group therapy), nonverbal procedures (e.g.	0.33981641953811176

Little is known about the reciprocal interrelation of such combinations.	0.30809342569099923
Along the example of a definite additive combination of psychodynamic and behavioural psychotherapy for agoraphobias and obsessive disorders a rationale for the interrelationship of the different therapeutic components is discussed.	0.49470282958559786
We report an 18-year old woman with surgically proven primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) and normal intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum levels.	0.676905442110424
The reason for this rare biochemical presentation are possible biologically active amino-terminal parathyroid hormone polypeptide fragments not detected by the widely used two-site immunoradiometric parathyroid hormone assay (PTH IRMA).	0.47121076258891587
Diagnosis and therapy of primary hyperparathyroidism therefore should not exclusively rest on the finding of hypercalcemia coupled with an elevated iPTH level.	0.5998942413697079

Malignant acanthosis nigricans is most often associated with an abdominal adenocarcinoma frequently unresectable at the time of diagnosis.	0.6367164062822412
We report on the rare association of acanthosis nigricans with a transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder.	0.5868677275828316
Symptomatic treatment with topical calcipotriol significantly reduced the hyperkeratotic and papillomatous skin changes.	0.40075235582859187
The goal of this evaluation study is to analyze the effects of a new gerontopsychiatric institution, the gerontopsychiatric center (GC: a combination of a home-based outpatient service, a day-hospital and a consulting office for elderly with mental disorders) on the reorganization process of the treatment system from intramural toward extramural structures, as experts of the government of the FRG have been demanding for a long time.	0.7572952122509851
Based on data of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies two regional catchment areas - the city of Bielefeld (without GC, control region) and the district of Gütersloh (with GC) - are compared and analyzed, whether changes within the gerontopsychiatric system (subsystem A), the system of general medical treatment (subsystem B), or within the elderly care system (subsystem C) occurred.	0.7950439960090222
Concerning subsystem A the results are that the GC has a strong impact on the intended shift from intra- to extramural structures, without selecting patients by diagnosis nor by severity degrees of their mental disorders in extramural treatment facilities.	0.5931830622711547
The home-based outpatient treatment is especially successful for elderly with a functional psychic disorder.	0.5271146247464328
These patients had the highest scores in improvement of psychiatric symptoms as well as in reduction of their self-care deficits within one year Effects of the GC on subsystem B were evident soon after its establishment, for example, by the increasing cooperation between the gerontopsychiatric health services and general hospitals in the region with GC, in which (hospitals) two fifths of all clinical gerontopsychiatric patients with a mental disorder as the main diagnosis (ICD-9) are treated.	0.8064755792776167
An effect of the GC on subsystem C is possibly the fact that in its region the rate of direct transfers of patients from the clinical gerontopsychiatric department into homes for the elderly is significantly lower than in the region without GC.	0.6714347971309066
In the field of psychoneuroimmunology it has become obvious that the immune system is governed by multiple influences from the central nervous system.	0.5081630669385241
One approach to verify these interactions can be seen in stress research.	0.45116432643473936
While the phenomenon of stress-induced changes in immunological processes is widely accepted, more recent studies focus on possible moderators and mechanisms of these responses.	0.590514650494725
Within this research strategy it became evident that catecholamine increases upon stress are of a major importance for the frequently observed mild leukocytosis.	0.49793287116846124
The present study was conducted to investigate whether the often observed stress-induced increases in the number of peripheral lymphocyte subsets depends on the amount of epinephrine or norepinephrine release.	0.6294453905258005
Moreover, the question was addressed whether high or low catecholamine release is related to subjective ratings on discomfort.	0.5210595851883838
Using a "public speaking paradigm" we were able to replicate previous findings of high increases in the absolute number of CD8+ and CD56+ cells in peripheral blood.	0.46006744241189146
Moreover, when dividing subjects into high and low catecholamine responders, the amount of change was significantly larger in catecholamine responders irrespective of whether norepinephrine or epinephrine was used for grouping the subjects.	0.5224331913646287
However, high and low catecholamine responders did not differ with respect to subjective ratings on discomfort.	0.5683769425762437
The data are discussed with respect to underlying mechanisms in catecholamine-induced lymphocyte migration and possible reasons for the mismatch between objective and subjective indicators of stressor efficacy.	0.4436599701270639
We report a locally recurrent retiform haemangioendothelioma (RHE) on the right great toe in a 40-year-old woman.	0.6939083348380461
There was a secondary soft tissue lesion on her right lower leg.	0.574354663127017
Histologically, primary lesion, local recurrence and the secondary soft tissue lesion (soft tissue metastasis?)	0.6774686076483342
Long, arborizing, neoplastic blood vessels were lined by CD31 and factor VIII-positive, monomorphic endothelial tumour cells; focally solid tumour areas, papillae and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate consisting of mature B and T lymphocytes were noted.	0.4164680898538032
The concept and the group of low-grade malignant vascular neoplasms is discussed, with special emphasis on inclusion of RHE in this category.	0.7025515877119841
HMSN is a hereditary symmetric ascending neuropathy of the peripherial nerves.	0.2830023072707552
Several cases of HMSN with motility disorders of both eyes have been reported in the literature.	0.5038851392969771
We describe a patient with HMSN type 1 and an incomplete peripherial 3rd nerve palsy of the right eye.	0.7129477088456082
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of developed unilateral oculomotor disorder in a patient with HMSN.	0.5911008534204786
A 34-year-old male (190 cm/100 kg) was scheduled for surgery of the nasal septum.	0.7464541791867784
He had had uneventful anaesthesia for appendicectomy 14 years earlier: following 600 mg thiopentone, 180 mg suxamethonium and up to 2 vol.% halothane for 20 min had been used and no symptoms of malignant hyperthermia (MH) were recorded.	0.5453913643039022
Following oral premedication with 2 mg flunitrazepam at 7.00 a.m. anaesthesia was induced with a priming dose of atracurium at 8.45 a.m. followed by 0.2 mg fentanyl, 500 mg thiopentone, and 100 mg suxamethonium.	0.6260502135198447
Endotracheal intubation was accomplished easily [9], and the patient was ventilated manually in a semi-closed circle system until spontaneous ventilation resumed.	0.631743392971958
Enflurane (1.5% for 5 min, 1.0% for 10 min, and 0.8% until the diagnosis of MH was suspected) was given in 33% O2/66% N2O.	0.9145660506674524
Seventy minutes after induction it was noted that the spontaneous respiratory rate and minute volume had risen continuously from 10/min and 6 l/min, respectively, to 20/min and 12 l/min.	0.6061721477149566
Attempts at deepening anaesthesia with repeated doses of fentanyl up to a total dose of 0.95 mg failed to reduce the hyperventilation.	0.5673283055255959
In spite of a high fresh gas flow of 6 l/min and assisted manual ventilation, the FIO2 started to fall from 0.34 to 0.28 at 10:20 a.m.	0.6489955224294242
The O2/N2O ratio was changed to 1 : 1, but the FIO2 remained at 0.3.	0.8081113178608703
MH was suspected, enflurane was discontinued, and an arterial blood gas analysis was done (Table 2).	0.7780540716714803
When marked acidosis and hypercarbia were found, dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg was given, the operation was terminated, and the patient's trachea was extubated and he was monitored closely in the intensive care unit for 24 h. Vital signs were stable (Table 3) and no further complications were observed.	0.7784230118714539
The patient did not mention pain or uneasiness postoperatively.	0.31420727610791055
About 6 months later, a muscle biopsy was done according to the European MH Protocol [5] and the patient was found to be MHEh.	0.7722606296690551
In this case five main reasons for the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis must be considered (Table 1).	0.6762557518870368
Firstly, hypoventilation does not seem to be reasonable as the patient was ventilated with 8 to 12 l/min, which is within the range of 80 - 120 mg/kg - min.	0.8369608395320466
Secondly, we can exclude shock and hypoperfusion because the patient had a normal blood pressure and heart rate (within 65 - 90 beats/min), his fingertips and skin were well perfused, his body temperature was 37  °C, and there was no sign of muscle rigidity.	0.6765594261389146
Thirdly, a defect of the CO2 adsorber as well as CO2 admixture to the N2O and O2 ventilation gases can cause hypercarbia.	0.48772261803027916
We use two absorbers in sequence of which one is changed every day, and found neither a change in colour of the indicator nor an abnormally raised temperature of the absorbers [11].	0.5131896527374661
A postoperative check of the ventilator showed no defect in the O2/N2O supply and a correctly functioning anaesthesia apparatus.	0.4223232640321817
A malfunction of both CO2 absorbers resulting in intraoperative hypercarbia could not explain a postoperative mixed acidosis lasting for more than 6 h. Anaesthesias performed at the same time using soda lime from the same canisters were totally uneventful.	0.5901937000431613
It is concluded that the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis were caused by hypermetabolism.	0.445789492791158
A thorough postoperative examination by an internist did not reveal any thyroid, pulmonary, endocrine, or circulatory reason for our intra- and postoperative findings.	0.6989555424418257
Iatrogenic factors like superficial anaesthesia or systemic side effects of adrenaline admixture to local anaesthetics can cause hypermetabolism without striking clinical signs, but they do not cause mixed acidosis lasting longer than 6 h (Table 2).	0.5568015155614879
The most suitable explanation in this case is an abortive form of MH.	0.6891566741181256
