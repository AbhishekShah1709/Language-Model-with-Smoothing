We need that because the various European Union bodies and all the Member States within monetary union have to be able to depend on one another.	1.2367210101196089
It is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons.	1.0589430463383793
Firstly, for the single market.	1.7334355869188387
It is most important quite generally in a single market to have reliable and directly comparable data and statistics so as to give an accurate picture of the situation and development trends.	1.265902448704513
Secondly, for economic and monetary union.	1.6451133528186193
The regulation dating from 1993 on the application of the Protocol must be brought into harmony with the methodology of the European system of accounts at national and regional level.	1.1029794215617434
That is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits.	0.8558792754887837
This adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the Member States more precisely.	0.9727368924466915
These technical changes will have a very real impact on the actual position of the countries, since the data will automatically be amended in line with the public deficit.	1.5023971340451356
I also welcome the fact that the estimates of the deficits for the 1999 financial year that are due to be published in March 2000 are already based on the new ESA, i.e. the analysis is based on consolidated aggregates that are economically relevant.	1.2148218291590132
Let me also briefly use this debate as an opportunity to urge all the governments and political parties to do their utmost to ensure that this procedure never has to be initiated for an excessive deficit.	1.2067210563643314
It is good that the procedure exists.	0.9295403304880336
We need it because it lends our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility.	0.82080529428444
The citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met.	0.9109566518515182
Thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously.	1.2206203761021248
Another important point is that we must do all we can, not just to prevent excessive deficits, but also to further reduce public deficits.	1.4405193370586076
I know what I am talking about and I will conclude by telling you why I am so glad we are holding this debate!	1.2387376095738782
We are currently holding a debate in my own country on whether the former minister for finance actually gave us accurate information on the deficit.	1.156382433946342
In my country, Austria, new elections had to be held in 1995 in order to meet the Maastricht criteria and persuade our political partner to rethink his approach.	1.0552683807149377
I must also tell you that in the year 2000, when there is so much talk about us, the coalition talks with the SPÖ failed - and unfortunately so - because the Socialist Party brought down the negotiated austerity and consolidation programme.	1.4340494124804055
That is a prime reason why the new government had to be formed in Austria; for the Austrian People' s Party, the ÖVP, wants to continue to act as guarantor of economic stability. The ÖVP wants to ensure that we continue to meet the Maastricht criteria and reduce the public deficit, as we have agreed here.	1.4390119559196572
Mr President, the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable.	1.2677268405677329
This is of great importance, especially in the light of European unification and the completion of the internal market.	1.0379028656596594
This is why this report is also so politically charged: a report, by the way, on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly.	1.6511170763113054
It also inspires a few political comments.	0.7297086382212834
The Stability Pact is a given in Europe.	0.9473161923065209
All countries participating in the euro have committed themselves, in the medium term, to striving towards a budget which is either balanced or shows up a slight surplus.	1.1854303992454422
This, of course, does not mean that, if the economic climate is less than favourable, the budget could not fluctuate up or down slightly. It means that, in the long and medium term, there should be a balance or surplus.	1.5044674938239897
The stronger the position of the participating countries, the stronger the euro will be.	1.1847861737031788
As a result, the three percent standard will rarely be exceeded, not even in a bad economic climate.	1.247009304041758
This is the theory behind it, anyway.	1.1691261544263096
We have always been of the opinion that these criteria should be stringently met.	1.1718453385870344
That is of great importance in order to turn the EMU into a success, now and in the future.	1.1807924386923974
Strict compliance with the Stability Pact can thus contribute to a culture of stability within all EMU Member States.	0.9438057220534326
Various Member States have taken one-off measures to be able to meet the criteria.	1.2052423925136737
We are of the opinion that the Member States' budget policy should be strictly supervised, to ensure that the measures continue to be taken in the spirit of the prescribed criteria at all times.	1.2995308933773337
A drop in standards should not be allowed.	0.7121976753937529
We are also of the opinion that a further reduction in the burden and reducing the national debt should be prioritised.	1.2402658631199097
Indeed, we still have not managed to stop passing on the burden to future generations.	1.2422215058651567
. (ES) Mr President, many thanks, first of all, to the rapporteur for his splendid work.	1.2489301533528019
It was a subject which called for a large dose of technical skill and I think Mr Knörr has handled it with great precision and professionalism.	1.1875164036923573
I would not presume to be able to summarise the content of our proposal better than he has done; I would just like to add one small point: in addition to adaptation to ESA 95, there are two small technical changes which Mr Knörr knows all about, relating to interest and the valuation of debt in foreign currency.	1.2387426441572542
I just mention that to complete the view of the process.	0.9990078306855587
Secondly, I would like to thank Mr Knörr for his speediness.	1.2069777375178081
He has done really good work in a very short time.	1.1627645940770872
This is an important subject for certain references which we have heard subsequently.	1.3157909627902449
What we are seeking with this legislation is not to make the statistics reliable and comparable - they already are - but to make them more reliable and more comparable.	1.4996713538092359
Obviously, the fact that Parliament has taken its decision so quickly will mean that the March figures can already be calculated on the basis of these new criteria.	1.2382179161309002
That being so, I believe the final result will be better.	1.4316675138732022
The figures will be more reliable and more comparable and I think the concerns some Members have raised about compliance with the stability pact can be better addressed.	1.1765908080094745
This regulation is purely instrumental.	0.7887996725244425
It does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised.	1.046148002847371
But we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem.	1.0055154210416148
The stability pact is in place and we will continue to press ahead with monitoring compliance by the various Member States, despite the fact that the results are clearly positive in all the Member States where we have analysed the position as regards the stability of the government deficit.	1.357613428540142
But we see no reason to lower our guard.	0.8623610304248406
We must press on in that direction because we know it is vital.	1.3324143299239208
So, once again - and finally - I want to thank you for your help in allowing us to measure stability with greater technical certainty and better comparability.	1.4277863024733501
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	0.7098551447841881
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	0.251962532894286
Increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting of the euro	0.6435411304396936
The next item is the report (A5-0020/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on a draft Framework Decision of the Council on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro (5116/1999 - C5-0332/1999 - 1999/0821(CNS)).	0.8294447245397074
.	-0.0
(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen (all the more welcome for being so few in number), one might have thought that it was an unimportant subject which was to be discussed at this hour, but that is not the case.	1.34437221243639
It is a definite and concrete issue. It is about our common currency.	1.6796298713922442
How many people here know that this currency is being counterfeited and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affairs?	1.3686836415590298
We cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited.	0.8765816314446818
The ECB, ECOFIN, Europol, OLAF and the Commissioner responsible for legal questions have therefore realised that common countermeasures must be taken quickly in order to close the loopholes left by the legislation.	1.1068635683639372
It is easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currencies for twenty years after the new currency has been introduced.	1.0168830349953726
It is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions.	1.1810076000907899
This is something which Parliament has said it wants to see added.	1.064968802442837
The Council ought to have given Parliament the stipulated three-month period within which to consider, too, the last document produced on this matter, but we are all aware of how urgent it is to have these measures put safely in place.	1.3470454487275902
Because the issue is to be decided upon in March in the Council, Parliament has cause to adopt a position on the proposal now, so that the Member States have time also to take due account of Parliament' s points of view in the decision which has to be made in March.	1.5300413534693666
Any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency, and that country would be accountable, both morally and economically, if its actions were to contribute to a delay.	1.3450263226463575
A country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself.	1.088000447008648
On 1 January 2002 the euro will be in circulation.	0.9629482876233506
The whole of the Union must have the same protection, a type of protection which prohibits counterfeiting, not only of currencies in circulation but also of currencies which will be in circulation.	1.562637389577395
It is important that, in time, there should be a more or less similar-looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries.	1.3754435980271082
The Commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information, together with penal sanctions, preventive measures and the pooling of experience.	1.058908618399262
These measures do, in fact, entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years' imprisonment.	1.1218047023835331
Trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences.	0.840559200025288
Quite simply, we are to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty.	1.3791041044539423
The denominations of the euro are well known.	1.0055794975426813
Modern computer equipment can be used to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves.	1.2597932564656305
Parliament has tabled a number of amendments to the present proposal, for example in regard to jurisdiction, the idea being that a person may only be prosecuted and sentenced in the one country for the same crime.	1.4569690029050053
There are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting, this being a measure which we would encourage.	1.3525638302788647
The new applicant States are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations.	0.9521739036675196
It has taken two years for the Council and the Commission to produce this proposal.	1.2863383130659973
It is essential that the decision should now be taken in March.	1.2508994907455626
To delay, or perhaps even risk damage to the euro, would be indefensible.	1.3283497431844262
It would also be a betrayal of the people who will be handling the new, unfamiliar notes.	1.0961290303505777
In particular, it is believed that counterfeiters will turn their attention to countries outside the euro zone, where people are less familiar with the new currency.	1.2905970920090286
The protective measures cover these countries too, and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight.	1.2724163626583305
The present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character, accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others.	1.007349391101349
The Council must now convene in March and make the relevant decision.	1.1417384643444886
Thank you for listening.	1.054947780889572
Thank you, too, those who contributed to this matter' s being dealt with swiftly. I am thinking in particular of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.	1.1418046798273807
Mr President, first I want to compliment the rapporteur, Charlotte Cederschiöld, on drawing up this report, which is an excellent point of departure for increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro.	1.2090247064187039
The euro will enter into circulation on 1 January 2002 and will become one of the world' s most important reserve currencies.	1.1146189236904778
Due to its importance on a world scale, the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery.	1.1897019422175619
This draft decision therefore lays down a set of minimum standards intended to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each Member State simpler and more effective.	1.0645896010638611
It also provides for the euro to be protected even prior to its circulation, which will fill a gap in legislation in some Member States.	1.2311060302428996
I expressly support the rapporteur as regards the need to extend this protection to national currencies which can continue to be exchanged after they have been withdrawn from circulation.	1.078233842327616
This means that every Member State must guarantee the establishment of effective, adequate penal sanctions, which act as a deterrent against the offences covered by the draft framework decision.	1.239669996367078
As to the proposal to establish a maximum custodial sentence of not less than eight years, I do not think that this will raise any problems as far as my country is concerned, even though the maximum sentence for counterfeiting under its criminal code is currently five years in prison, as it has already expressed willingness to make this amendment.	1.447658917442547
I also call on those few Member States still harbouring reservations to resolve them so that a decision can rapidly be reached on this matter, for the reasons our rapporteur set out earlier when she called for this to be done.	1.1589663616977934
Mr President, this draft framework decision represents the first time a common proposal on crime has been put forward, with legislation to be applied by all fifteen Member States at the same time.	1.5003811551336326
We are therefore making progress towards the aim of developing and confirming the status of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, as expressed at Tampere.	1.213500297671223
Mr President, I need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points Mr Coelho made. All that is indeed very true and correct.	1.3695642146496991
It is easy to counterfeit the euro.	0.695958879332793
We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history.	1.1510766671335266
It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already. Yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such, counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence.	1.4330225952574895
It is a highly complex problem.	1.3473329348676522
If we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschiöld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation.	1.1383026428298642
Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people.	1.0241715223809704
So what is the European Union doing about it?	1.3280092649392707
It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschiöld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschiöld, but more at the procedures that are being applied.	1.3951725808871587
The manner in which the Council, which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy.	1.3157715716292142
We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment.	1.4661311513964657
Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months.	1.3266177935144252
It is only thanks to the immense efforts of Mrs Cederschiöld and to Parliament' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages, that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the Council, so that the decision scheduled for March can indeed be taken.	1.4002754628141068
On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us.	1.0693363154034392
So let me state quite clearly here, on behalf of my group, that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschiöld whether it is reasonable to work like this.	1.1664331711570468
We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure.	1.450598522805738
This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress.	0.8847965778272477
Only, as Mrs Cederschiöld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited.	1.3894249553957079
One reason they have not been dealt with is that as ever the leopard cannot change its spots, i.e. in the case of this framework decision, which specifically relates to judicial cooperation, the Council once again prefers to adhere to the level of government cooperation.	1.238806083896574
That is why, and I quote, this framework decision "is confined to supplementing the provisions of the International Convention of 20 April 1929 for the suppression of counterfeiting and its Protocol" , i.e. the provisions of a timeworn international convention that is a good 71 years old.	1.2746152839973086
That means that the legal basis we are now seeking to establish to protect the euro does not derive from Community legislation, as it should, but merely takes the form of provisions supplementing an international convention dating back 71 years.	1.395821684364428
I leave it to the assembled company in this Chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a European Union based on judicial cooperation.	1.3631507062761246
Thank you for your attention during our night sitting together.	0.9507497754546002
Mr President, the launch of the euro could well be a heaven-sent opportunity for counterfeiters.	1.184655727148496
The fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references, and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article.	1.2938637682701635
So the Council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions, primarily criminal, applicable in all the countries of Europe, against offences of this kind.	1.2679930729771847
No doubt the Council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that Member States adopt national legislation to that effect.	1.0619805704012988
That is what I would have preferred, personally.	1.5555457062892069
But, probably through lack of confidence in the zeal of certain members, the Council has preferred to implement a legal instrument which is more binding at European level: a framework decision.	1.3420631470741415
Now that is where the difficulties begin, because criminal law comes under national sovereignty and the Treaty of Maastricht contains no specific provision covering this situation for the euro - so as not to frighten the voters by over-egging the pudding.	1.2717769161706243
The draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this lacuna by referring to Articles 31 and 34(2)(b) of the Treaty.	0.927218763622409
However, I find these passports inadequate.	1.4341320007392457
Article 31 only envisages minimum common rules for criminal acts in certain cases, specifically restricted to organised crime, terrorism and drug trafficking.	1.035282233394339
Counterfeiting is not on the list.	0.7627462632490529
Article 34, a product of the Treaty of Amsterdam, only lays down the new form of a framework decision, and clearly this only applies to the existing powers of the European Union.	1.3435013791066026
So we come back to the previous problem.	0.9325931165514771
In other words, the Council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis.	1.146973769774155
In a way, this is deferred punishment for its lack of honesty, at the time, in presenting the Maastricht Treaty to the voters.	1.4397478288861092
I would also like to make a more general point.	1.171432830159194
Not so long ago we were dealing with one or more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part-session.	1.119536661009728
But there has been nothing for a year.	1.004767182827767
Just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting.	0.8219021249682127
The Commission' s communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, which we have debated this week, contained absolutely nothing on this vast subject, except the reminder, in a single line, that the euro coins and notes are due to come into circulation on 1 January 2002.	1.2777439995711646
However, there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved.	1.3789833936057148
Let us mention, for example, the disturbing lack of public interest, the definition of monetary policy objectives abusively reduced to the mere fight against inflation, the strange coupling of monetary federalism to a lack budgetary or fiscal federalism, the status of the present applicant countries, when they become members, vis-à-vis the euro zone, the confused reaction of the international markets to this currency with no homogeneous popular foundation, and so on. Do I also need to mention that investors who sold dollars to buy euros have lost 20% since 1 January 1999, 40% if they bought bonds, and no less than 55% if they sold yen to buy euros?	1.2966410234826466
Mr President, for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money.	1.3039879169238706
These are gigantic problems but they seem to be taboo here.	0.7706891822236912
I should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker.	1.4008624883886645
There are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions, because the point of departure is, of course, that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern.	1.2714182876367883
Criminal law is part of each individual nation' s own cultural tradition, and it is very difficult to arrive at common definitions of what is to be understood by these basic legal concepts.	1.2488239401530612
I appreciate Mrs Cederschiöld' s work, and my point of departure will be her search - in connection with the Tampere Summit - for common definitions and common regulations regarding what is punishable and what common sanctions can be applied.	1.4477668069050351
She would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the EU.	1.1400376405438284
But the problem is that there is no legal basis for this, and with good reason, because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction.	1.3493692624164506
In that context, I want to ask the following question of the Commission' s and the Council' s representatives: is the legal basis which has been invoked adequate?	1.6566076573490458
In my view, it is clearly in conflict with, and far exceeds the scope of, Article 34, paragraph 2, point b where a legal basis is established for so-called framework decisions which are binding upon the Member States in regard to the desired objectives, but in which it is left to the national authorities to determine the form and methods of implementation.	1.451510666139643
What of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the Member States' obligations are laid down in detail. There is no freedom of choice regarding methods and implementation.	1.3676018518618336
In my view, this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis.	1.1380940886425286
I should like an answer from the Commission and the Council, for I consider it obvious that Article 31 does not supply the relevant legal basis.	1.3710610182429777
Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that, in her report, she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes, which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now, to supplement and improve the text.	1.3183536822389126
It is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to spoil this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting - and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made.	1.3289196862239308
We have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it.	0.9797145353721629
So, in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting, to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions, the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do.	1.5478700918960178
We are also concerned with the question of cooperation.	1.1563899790731276
We need to define the precise responsibilities of the ECB, the national central banks, the Commission and Europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro.	1.3735985046344485
I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work.	1.0373980948636934
In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities.	1.3287235263895263
Aside from the report, which we welcome, many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved.	1.3505220037402106
I hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification.	1.1361078857649989
Mr President, Mrs Cederschiöld, ladies and gentlemen, how safe is the euro?	1.3645438599931607
That is, after all, a question the people often ask.	1.1596952778112217
And that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 January 2002, the date when they will have euros in their pockets.	1.2082859290149757
For the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but, in fact, also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	1.4255561437469526
That too is a concern of the people, for, as has rightly been said, this will be a new currency for them, new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used.	1.5334909169038617
Of course all the citizens of the EU Member States will also be faced with the novelty of a currency that is valid over such a wider area, and even beyond Europe, as a reserve currency.	1.434740182201372
They will need time to get used to that too.	0.8945394319902302
So it is clearly necessary to ask what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting.	1.238182017770611
And that is what we are discussing at this late hour.	1.1627407086197743
This really is a subject that is close to the citizen, so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour.	1.442467845779878
But that cannot be helped.	0.5895573599587061
Of course, the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time.	1.2898442999619077
After all, it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting.	1.2063473703634846
As has also been pointed out, in summer 1998 the Commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken, such as information, further training - an important area, cooperation between the euro-states and of course even beyond them, and measures under criminal law.	1.4332282836025108
That is what this framework decision is about.	1.2204559828002064
Mrs Cederschiöld, let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the Commission and, above all, let me also thank Parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time.	1.236613509746507
I certainly appreciate that.	0.6288202390879523
The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences.	1.1658552773417215
Of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and, as was emphasised, what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced.	1.426430565206284
Naturally, the Commission is also glad that the European Parliament' s prompt decision - and I hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now, so that we can begin to transpose it.	1.4787670266826989
For the Commission has been asked to report, as it will in the first half of next year, on the progress in transposing it in the Member States, on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action.	1.6640403077315926
It has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law.	1.3480437520819781
In that respect we must recognise this innovation, this step, even if, as Mr Schulz just pointed out, simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step.	1.4375150213051089
In reply to the question whether the Commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the Treaty, the Commission believes that the right basis is being applied here.	1.4336267571421397
The framework decision will, however, have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future.	1.2349046237369952
The Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with Europol.	1.2046135741033897
That proposal will establish a duty to cooperate, and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify Europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, so that effective measures can then be taken.	1.3561023862968782
On the question of coordinating the various measures, since early 1998, the Commission, followed now by OLAF, has been working with experts on the subject from the Member States, the European Central Bank and Europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance.	1.4360576761868922
As Mr Karas just pointed out, a few weeks ago the Commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro, to which it proposed allocating as much as EUR 32 million.	1.4140437114551567
That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	1.2211875682214963
I believe that this debate shortly before midnight will also teach a salutary lesson to all those counterfeiters who believe their hour has come, because they think the EU is no longer awake at this late hour!	1.2901437802460989
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.	0.6645382420525882
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	0.251962532894286
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)	0.5012001247970661
Resumption of the sitting	0.6212265099123361
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	0.3735514178617478
Are there any comments?	0.1337831580886173
(The Minutes were approved)	0.08791063492812108
Mr President, I should like make a comment in connection with a meeting held last night by various Members of Parliament from all groups.	1.2827671981592925
The purpose of the meeting, which was attended by several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, together with the architects who designed this building, was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions.	1.2213236451440521
We discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you, Mr President, in fact conceals a huge window which, if the curtain were drawn back, would afford a wonderful view over the river.	1.316158006087254
We were told that the curtain was closed so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the lighting during debates.	1.1785017326876956
But what is to prevent us, before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting, opening the curtains and enjoying the apparently magnificent view behind you?	1.159768973249138
I am more than happy for our House to be illuminated by the brilliance of our debates but a little real sunlight on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss.	0.9891323643844709
I think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the ushers.	1.120120897495526
Thank you very much Mr Onesta, I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort.	1.2518134128590237
I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being.	1.0219256603653544
In the meantime, I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter, technically speaking.	1.4715227894299991
If so, then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the President sits with his back to the light!	1.166671940602318
UCITS	-0.0
.	-0.0
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my hope that Parliament is prepared now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in Europe.	1.1357970060454348
As a new Member of the European Parliament, it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter.	1.4514301240559493
I should especially like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their willingness to find compromises; the President and the Bureau for lending a sensitive ear to this complex issue; the Commission, and especially the Commissioner, for being such worthwhile contacts; the Council; and also the division responsible for servicing the committee, for its selfless work.	1.449437313275291
There was a good deal of agreement within the committee, apart from on a matter which, too, I hope it will be possible to solve.	1.2271297348058336
The issue of UCITS may appear difficult, technical and a political minefield.	1.0031120552864166
I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stands for.	1.2471965026390197
Allow me, however, to state very clearly that this is a question which really does affect the citizens of Europe in so far as it relates to how their savings are administered, what options there are available, how competition operates between countries in regard to different forms of savings, savers' demand for security, and the opportunities Europe' s citizens have to save wisely for their old age.	1.3559207143349548
It is a question of weighing demands for liberalisation in the interests of a better market and higher yield against investors' need for protection and security.	1.0110989946212046
In the course of the 1980s, most markets in Europe underwent drastic deregulation. As a result, the national money and bond markets in particular developed very quickly over a period of a few years.	1.2655619650793875
Collective investment undertakings became an alternative to saving with a bank.	0.7811351166605179
In my own country, more than 60 per cent of Swedes save with a variety of funds.	0.9020561826354176
The security afforded by this type of saving is attributable to the broad range of investment vehicles in which the funds are placed.	1.0298567098070803
The capital and securities market has continued to be developed.	0.9477999683046865
The current Directive on UCITS has become antiquated and outdated.	0.8306437009816509
New types of funds have been introduced in the various Member States which are not permitted to market their units in other Member States.	1.0823626317500659
Obviously, this inhibits competition and innovation and restricts the public' s range of savings options.	1.0914784069223649
The Commission' s proposal with which we are dealing today is in two parts.	1.3613161112106948
The first concerns the product, that is to say the funds.	1.068455556590226
The other concerns the collective investment undertakings.	0.8536306690913651
The main purpose of the first proposal is to extend the investment opportunities of collective investment undertakings by allowing them to invest in units in other collective investment undertakings, for example units in funds, standardised options and futures contracts and deposits in credit institutions and in certain types of money market instruments.	1.1320176406550706
Special risk-spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments, involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria.	0.9683895453085654
In addition, the Commission' s proposal puts forward special risk-spreading rules for funds whose aim is to replicate a particular stock index, a so-called index fund.	1.126472697900092
The committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the Commission' s proposal more stringent.	1.3440196796297217
To guarantee transparency and prudence, investments in non-harmonised funds should only be allowed on condition that qualitative criteria, for example a transparency requirement and investor protection, are introduced.	1.0727373944146497
In addition, quantitative criteria (risk exposure) should be introduced.	1.0979382206918515
Moving on now, then, to the point where there is (or, I hope, was) a lack of agreement, namely OTC derivatives.	1.5580683767609065
The Commission' s proposal makes a distinction between derivatives dealt in on regulated markets and derivative instruments not dealt in on regulated markets (so-called OTC derivatives).	0.920151641282434
The Commission' s proposal takes it as read that OTC derivatives are not one of the general types of investment that UCITS deal in, but that they should only be used to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange-rate risks.	1.3179278570007205
In recent years, the derivatives market has grown very rapidly in almost all the Member States.	0.9665712759673288
It is therefore important that regulation of derivatives is flexible so that the market is not tied down ahead of future developments.	1.1213913160862226
The definitions 'standardised futures contracts' and 'standardised options' should therefore be combined to form a new definition, 'financial derivative instruments' , which also covers OTC derivatives.	1.1648471718522357
Investment in OTC derivatives, however, should only be allowed on condition that both quantitative and qualitative criteria are introduced.	1.0388530472038686
They are very important in this case.	1.1676264526695403
They must be introduced to guarantee the protection of investors.	1.020372561918303
The Commission' s second proposal focuses on the bodies which manage UCITS, that is to say management companies.	1.2133092232157168
The rules for management companies, for example the conditions for starting up and conducting business, are brought into line with the existing rules and regulations.	1.311059999741967
A crucial point is that rules are proposed for so-called simplified prospectuses.	0.9432647903590439
Relevant information must be given to prospective unit-holders in a fund in a language which is readily understandable to investors in the host country.	0.9431956094568263
In this regard, too, the committee is prepared to go further than the Commission.	1.1945516389058664
A question which has also been discussed in the committee is that of the capital contribution to be required from management companies.	1.4266774902642174
There are different views on this.	0.8546954811067501
One of the most important things, for me, personally, is that the common regulations should not cause smaller companies to go under.	1.3184578006755265
During the months that I have been working on this report, one very clear demand has emerged, both from industry and from those who represent the consumer.	1.2733605884031876
The current situation is not good.	1.0419947698626137
Both savers and the industry need modernised regulations for the whole of Europe.	0.8521245935573714
I believe that today' s proposal strikes a good balance between liberalisation of the market and the desire for effective protection for investors.	1.409370094121713
I just want to conclude by saying that a number of Members of Parliament think that the present proposal goes too far, while others think that I am not sufficiently liberal.	1.5257129651555354
To them I just want to say, as the English expression goes, 'You can' t have it all.'	1.2556978006702981
.	-0.0
Mr President, at the outset I wish to place on the official record of the House my thanks for the tremendous work undertaken by Mr Schmidt, our rapporteur.	1.4724863233171488
I was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous Parliament.	1.202627876098356
We failed over the last six years to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter.	1.0722801405265632
In a short space of time Mr Schmidt has managed to bring it forward to this final stage within Parliament. I thank him for that.	1.2726597137551656
As the draftsperson for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I also wish to place on record my thanks to the secretariat of both the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee for their cooperation on this matter.	1.0553595972325924
I am speaking today wearing a number of hats: firstly, as the surrogate father of this report; secondly, as the draftsperson of the opinion; and most importantly, as one who sees the tremendous advantages which can be gained for the European Union from a harmonised system of UCITS investment to ensure that monies presently being earned in Europe but invested outside the European Union and not put to the benefit of the Union economy can be retained within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship, employment and also for guaranteeing future pension rights.	1.4585295442283945
There is little disagreement amongst Members with regard to the first proposal.	1.0915687518615587
It puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities.	1.263580057341783
However, it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern.	1.7148097041597643
I have a number of ideas which should be put across.	1.2367913836631754
Firstly, the idea of an EU passport for management companies is to be welcomed; and the home-state approval rule is also to be welcomed.	1.4003763542037324
However, instead of imposing a new regime, we could have used the Investment Services Directive as the analogy for this regime.	1.3572741502749426
It seems unusual that we failed to grasp that opportunity.	0.7686552169431553
Many Members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries' national interests rather than improving the overall system for Europe.	1.1236981536061204
We will have to revisit this issue again in the near future.	0.8043770122990459
I call on Members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put Europe on a sound footing for the short term, if not for the long term.	1.3041984268420763
Mr President, I must firstly thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, my colleague, Mr Goebbels, and Mrs Villiers and Mrs Lulling from my Group. Despite their differing opinions on some points, they have consistently worked in an extremely constructive manner.	1.4913513675251067
As indicated by the rapporteur, we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this Parliament.	1.501890052115661
Collective investment undertakings have for some time been the primary savings vehicle through which millions of ordinary citizens, without any specialist knowledge, have invested their life savings.	1.1838482129776653
This is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation, albeit in a prudent manner.	1.2911955206851389
I say this because the failure of a bank is a problem for which any government can find a solution.	1.0314519293994233
However, the failure and suspension of payments of this type of undertaking would create a political, social and personal problem with incalculable consequences.	1.205964557439038
There is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings.	1.2174869494600264
I believe in a social market economy based on a successful market operating subject to certain rules intended to guarantee the general interest. Specifically, at the moment, this means the protection of investors.	1.3411595395142821
This basic principle of liberalisation, increased competition and greater investment opportunities, together with prudence to ensure the protection which investors deserve, has determined and inspired my Group' s position on most of the controversial points which have arisen.	1.239978036277781
Firstly, there is the problem of investment in non-harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive.	1.2072642431090685
It is clear that by extending the proposal under discussion, the options and the range of investments in undertakings for collective investments, those undertakings which remain outside the rules will be obliged to invest in high-risk funds.	1.1605210252404647
It would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments.	0.9899228974380232
Secondly, the problem of derivatives is one which has created the most divisions, both within my Group and between the groups.	1.4701735941034058
We have achieved a compromise solution.	0.9393244826455452
Everyone accepts that investments in derivatives must be legally limited in order to prevent a harmonised fund losing all its assets due to an investment in high-risk products.	1.1609976271064948
It is clear that this risk is greater when the investment is in derivatives not dealt in on a regulated market, namely the famous OTC derivatives.	1.1628538425583088
We have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this, or so we believe, which I welcome.	1.4484865570507597
As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage, I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament.	1.407666586041968
The texts before us today are old and were already old when they reached this House. This was because they were substantially amended during the Finnish Presidency.	1.23034405950238
We are therefore faced with two options. We can either return the proposals to the Commission for the latter to present a harmonised text or we can continue the current process.	1.4461048448068772
This second option has won the day and I am pleased about this. However, in the future I hope that the coordination between these two institutions and the Council can be improved so that our work is more understandable and more productive.	1.5468287971776558
Mr President, the Socialist Group supports the Commission' s efforts to implement the action plan for financial services.	1.291347186998735
Obviously, in the wake of the introduction of the euro, we need to create an integrated European financial market which is similar to the American and Japanese markets.	1.3187453633476505
The debates on UCITS gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee.	1.1512586386801438
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and also Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, for their constructive approach.	1.2644489585350813
The Socialists recognise the importance of the investment fund industry to the development of our economies and to the allocation of resources.	1.1867225994573551
But the world of international finance is a dangerous one.	1.1955734846068564
The capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses.	0.9388767530529054
There is at present a surfeit of cash looking for a home.	0.9777291618952552
In 1999, the increase in the means of payment in the world resulted in over-stimulated stock exchanges and an explosion in the volume of transactions, pushing up the prices of long-term financial and real assets.	1.1357146008235992
And as international financial activity speeds up, the risks increase.	1.1009846582947291
You do not need a Nobel prize in economics to realise that the current working hypothesis of the financial markets, which anticipate annual growth in profits of the order of 15 to 25% is quite simply unrealistic in the medium term.	1.1802566885363945
I adamantly believe that the main risk to the world economy in the foreseeable future is not inflation, but deflation generated as the speculative bubbles, created by what Alan Greenspan calls irrationally exuberant markets, burst.	1.2839174591011666
The legislature has a duty to contain the risk inherent in the continuing deregulation of the European financial markets.	1.067040167276253
By definition, investment funds use other people' s money.	0.9094211501796838
The legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses.	0.9131944058692762
There is no freedom without rules.	1.0897734981759395
We have done away with so-called master-feeder structures.	1.020748176590963
These feeder funds exist in the United States, which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system.	1.3330420047198157
The European market is still fragmented and such structures would doubtless cause problems.	0.8625468236846163
The Socialists, like the Commission, question the advisability of allowing investment funds to invest in so-called over-the-counter derivatives, i.e. products negotiated between professionals by private contract.	1.192853812764602
As these transactions are generally not subject to prudential control, the risks are all the more obvious.	1.1580068131266077
The Socialist Group has tabled amendments proposing both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clauses in order to contain the risks to investors.	1.0271657232158595
By adopting these amendments, Parliament will allow recourse to OTC derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors.	1.0662059153617003
Mr President, there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance.	1.3460431823747354
This principle should not only guide the public sector, it should also guide the private sector, especially financial undertakings.	1.356764977505665
Mr President, our objective in setting a framework for unit trusts and other UCTIS is to secure the highest possible safe return for our savers, which is why I want to address the issue of derivatives in my remarks today.	1.3244140459001674
I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure, safer, higher returns.	1.0015399000729066
Despite their image of danger, derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance.	0.7670324947365471
A contract that, for example, pays a substantial sum if, say, the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index falls, causes an extra payment by the investor if the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index rises.	0.9637144391839768
Is this speculative?	0.3456875339343949
Not at all.	0.3007153420889322
Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident: they have good management, good prospects and they are good investments.	1.2042734110228128
Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse, as it did in 1987.	1.2626609579518413
You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash, but that would be to waste your research into the winners.	1.269181114457521
It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall.	0.9369826352781632
The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls.	0.9189135780594128
But even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheaper, perhaps insuring you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index, you would still have the portfolio and the shares, but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse.	1.185147143365776
In exchange, you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets.	1.2017735243689704
In this case, which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers, you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk.	1.3000517571228125
That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund.	1.057993523769651
History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation.	0.8836115039829542
Heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers.	1.2192495575736864
Pension funds which suffered from rules on where they could and could not invest, as required by of our government bonds, made returns of 5.2% a year, barely half the 9.5% annual returns made by free funds between 1984 and 1996.	1.0931504246288577
These are of course the returns after deducting all losses.	1.0648934038053335
Do not confuse a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off.	1.1215207735225106
This is what we should be concerned about here today.	1.2753783015097344
Mr President, the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in Europe, including the most sophisticated forms of investment.	1.3308263902771442
We do not, in principle, oppose this industry.	1.0844059173932428
However, unlike Mr Christopher Huhne, we feel that a continent which has proved incapable of controlling its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may, in time, provoke the same type of crisis.	1.267123218703958
We shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group.	1.0572040518003365
But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole.	1.1506940795458502
We shall also vote in the future against any proposals to deregulate the financial markets and we call on all the other political groups to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income is finally harmonised.	1.199285435180954
For years certain countries, including Great Britain, have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens.	1.1492733133527138
They even reject the strict minimum, i.e. the Monti package proposed by the Commission in Brussels.	1.0974016689850183
This attitude is turning Europe into a machine which exempts investment income from tax and shifts the whole tax burden to commercial income, with all the social and even moral consequences which that implies.	1.0464430919562269
We must put an end to this.	0.7353396917329221
By blocking the demands of the financial industry, the European Parliament has the means to ensure that countries which have been turned into tax havens end up with their back against the wall.	1.2985188650524766
Mr President, the 1985 directive introduced a sort of European visa for certain types of UCITS which could be marketed throughout the Union.	0.9806254755039456
Since then, the capital market and transferable securities have not just continued to evolve; thanks to unbridled financial globalisation, they have exploded exponentially and without restraint.	1.130830294660512
This brings us to the two proposals for directives.	1.0220405424404582
The second proposal, on which the report is excellent, does not require any particular comment.	1.2076103376019123
It aims to strengthen consumer protection and security.	0.7858510220592689
It is a step in the right direction, even if one wonders why in heaven, with what right and with what respect for our citizens, we are further bolstering the monopoly of the English language in all documents distributed throughout Europe.	1.2733343075966324
That is the thrust of an amendment which we have tabled; it favours all the languages of the Community and our agreement to the second directive will depend on it.	1.4164131439932341
The same cannot be said of the first proposal.	0.7289953035208304
We might have been able to agree to the original text insofar as it was informed by a legitimate concern to update current legislation.	1.1613764717717634
However, we are unable to agree to the text of the report, although I welcome the work carried out by Mr Schmidt, for several reasons.	1.3998209176531191
First, it leans too far towards products based on indexes which have no bearing on the real economy; derivatives which will help to swell the financial bubble which Mr Lipietz referred to just now.	1.1569022370082773
Secondly, like him, I think that we should not promote excessive concentration in funds which, in the final analysis, will prove to be a Trojan horse for American pension funds.	1.5120695101476074
There is, of course, no reciprocity in favour of European UCITS.	1.2016296780588474
We shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the Member States to increase to 35% ...	1.1511890053087543
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
Mr President, this is a vital issue for Europe.	1.399754323303534
A Europe that faces an impending pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their savings.	1.0157761536299394
I welcome many of the developments which Mr Schmidt' s report brings us.	1.0242316992935698
UCITS are a success story within the European Union.	0.7986233334794232
They are a safe product, traded cross-border.	0.9143938862257359
But it is time for the legislation to be updated.	1.2200857579071882
Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here.	0.811563148632282
It is no secret that I would have much preferred Mr Schmidt' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through Parliament.	1.3697804965527762
But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach on this issue.	1.1668458297854982
The radical step taken by this report is to allow UCITS to use over-the-counter derivatives.	0.9637484028959692
I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS.	1.163736234865506
We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation. We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans.	1.2337030548285124
Mr Schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivatives.	0.9554562092315224
We must not be afraid to go forward, to react to changes in the market.	1.312628387908251
Yes, we need to continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumers.	1.2322477495741109
The report gives very adequate protection for consumers.	0.8059491602891099
But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives.	0.9379399941426387
I feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts, which can only help individual people around Europe obtain a high return on their savings.	1.1912115542358237
I salute Mr Schmidt.	0.43010390705813367
Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn.	0.9106720181606729
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an update for you on the curtain and window situation.	1.1442073989625703
If we open this curtain, then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away.	1.1587536835965169
We will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sitting. However, I will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies.	1.3990813089335383
Mr President, the UCITS directive has been an enormous success since it entered into force on 1 October 1989, mainly thanks to the excellent protection which it offers investors.	1.2427386399098095
The directive and the reputation which UCITS enjoy with investors have allowed the investment fund industry to multiply its assets in the European Union fivefold.	0.9728200890747843
There has been a strong increase in cross-border marketing of investments within the European Union and the directive itself is used as a model for legislation throughout the world.	1.2318464282587398
However, the directive is ten years old and, now that the markets have developed and more and more sophisticated financial products are available, it is somewhat outdated.	1.4238159779794364
The Commission proposals being debated here will give it the face-lift it needs.	1.0196379391293298
I share some of the concerns expressed here, especially by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, but this face-lift would be even more successful if the funds which simply reproduce a stock exchange index, and which are therefore managed either passively or not at all, and the funds which use an index as a benchmark for an actively-managed fund were treated in the same way, if only to allow medium-sized undertakings listed on the stock exchange but not included in the stock exchange index better access to the capital market.	1.296130024246998
In addition, investors often have better protection with an actively-managed fund.	1.0127851844216549
My Amendment No 47 is therefore a warning for amateurs.	1.0354924349532955
As far as the proposal for a new provision limiting investments in the same group to 15% is concerned, I would like to stress that, apart from the fact that this limit is too low, the text does not define the concept of a group. This concept does not exist under European law because it is impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice.	1.3464451719584454
I shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment.	1.14712785516119
To conclude, Mr President, allow me to remind the House that the directive needs a makeover which will make UCITS even more attractive, but it does not need to be strapped into a European corset which will squeeze the life out of it.	1.224740150429973
- (DE) Mr President, the introduction of the euro and the further liberalisation of capital markets has already produced a larger and deeper European financial area, which is helping to open up markets and create price transparency, but also to increase competition.	1.2232621433195008
At the same time, it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings, particularly those we are concerned with today.	1.3184013732210236
At the end of 1999 there were almost 15 000 investment funds registered as UCITS with a total value of in excess of EUR 2 billion, thereby accounting for roughly 75% of all funds assets.	1.1336828513093111
Hence the Commission rightly cited the economic importance thereof in its proposals for draft directives, and I must say that I actually have every confidence in the Commission' s proposal.	1.25195084093011
We are all aware how difficult it is to improve a legal framework for investment funds, and how difficult it is to construct the European passport for management companies around particular standards which are to apply even-handedly across the board.	1.2437714037163223
This therefore represents a step forward in respect of the legal and supervisory stipulations for financial markets and financial products.	1.2362098610233665
It is also my primary concern to optimise consumer protection in this way and I think it is very important for this to be reflected in the Commission' s proposal and that of the European Parliament, as well as in the compromise motions.	1.4285587034643392
However, I do not believe that we can assess the risk associated with the OTC derivatives, and I also think that as a European Parliament it is our duty to inform and impress again and again on consumers - who expect investment funds to be comparable with a traditional savings agreement when it comes to long-term security, and indeed that is why they were known as investment savings - that these products do not bear comparison and that is why we need a minimum level of protection.	1.5211851292407002
Why do we not take our cue from the minimum level of protection afforded by the trade in transferable securities directive, Article 11 for example, which relates to good practice?	1.2489046920125226
I therefore believe that this is another step forward we can take and I think it would also be a positive move if consumers and investors could be made aware of a fund' s name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile.	1.3173452273574306
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions.	1.1502547197736466
The preparatory work has largely consisted of a viable balance between increasing the efficacy and growth of the European investment markets and preserving a sufficient level of protection for consumers who buy fund units.	1.1082892119856442
The greater the trust consumers have in investment market operations, the more consumers will be prepared to invest on the open market.	1.139379004788504
And the more consumers invest, the brighter the prospects will be in the European business money markets.	1.446981245564088
It is quite clear that when businesses can more easily have access to their own capital-based finances their financial structure will be more firmly based, and, thus, opportunities for growth and investment will also improve.	1.1525388741229934
Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here.	1.0145502296100604
Although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment, the debate we had was not the easiest one.	1.2732086356941323
For me personally at least, difficulties were caused by the directive' s technical division into two different proposals, which certainly did not make it easier to familiarise oneself with this very difficult technical subject.	1.1198954274279362
However, I would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals.	1.314210037822562
Firstly, I am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments.	1.3924204420838384
As regards derivatives, I consider the position adopted by the committee justified - unlike Mrs Randzio-Plath, for example.	1.352222938427783
The directive should not treat over-the-counter derivatives differently from standard derivatives because they are used in many Member States and were also used before.	1.1081181610616608
With regard to Article 5g of the other proposal for a directive, the so-called Article on Delegation, I think the Commission' s original proposal on rules concerning authorisation was better than the one now approved in the committee, so I would support some of Mrs Villiers' amendments to this point.	1.4378686148724045
Mr President, I see two problems with this morning' s debate.	1.2047191215870623
Firstly, when I came to this Parliament many years ago I was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a Liberal.	1.4030776131290168
Now I have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the Luxembourg Members are in the Chamber at one time - and they are.	1.3649401794342342
Firstly, I welcome proposal No 1.	1.4938053040726826
It simplifies things and brings things up to date.	0.7796227989067687
I think many of the British Members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report.	1.2758787837723504
We support the Schmidt report on proposal No 1, but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks.	1.2635938312927781
We believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward.	1.2487541013899774
Secondly, we consider proposal No 2 to be very confused.	1.6168703039091228
It is difficult to understand, and we think the Commission would be well advised to look at it again.	1.345986326682611
If further regulation is needed, we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive.	1.2383653291587016
In particular, we disagree with the proposal on capital requirements because if they are put too high they could actually drive some businesses out of the industry altogether.	1.2078653143215559
We ask the Commission to look again at these proposals.	1.0220888136116284
Finally, we would urge Members to vote in particular against Amendment No 41 on capital requirements, because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry.	1.5127227296689938
Mr President, money does not smell, as the Romans would say.	1.4908033423923526
The important thing is for money to generate more money.	0.8763356254403356
This is the only opportunity that we have to see to it that the interests of economists converge with those of people who want to earn money and have their mind set on dollars, like Disney' s Scrooge McDuck, who has dollar signs for eyes, except in this case the symbol is that of the euro.	1.2968210414571795
In this we are combining the interests of these citizens with the interests of pensioners who want to live life in tranquillity.	1.1484180459846431
For example, my brother-in-law, who lives in Rome, started drawing his pension a year ago and every day since - from seven in the morning when he wakes until midnight - he has checked the TV screen to see how the pensions funds and the securities in which he has invested are performing.	1.3183402173195324
Pensioners will, in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal.	1.4290638735404855
Indeed, whilst the young are penniless, the elderly have accumulated money and, since they are keen to turn it to good advantage, harbour great hopes for this directive.	1.2986129391012278
If national governments had in their hearts - as the European Union has in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earned during the course of a working life, the pensions time bomb would already have been defused.	1.459105753928586
You too, in your role, Commissioner Bolkestein, have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and of pensioners, a future that I hope will improve once we have finalised this directive, by which I mean very soon, as has been proposed by Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi.	1.594502758120199
. (NL) Mr President, could I first of all express my heartfelt thanks to rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has principal authority, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Brian Crowley and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, whom I would like to thank for their thorough and important work on the refinement and extension of the proposals.	1.2944042612921618
Since the approval of Directive 85/611, the investment funds sector has undergone lengthy development and it is now important to modernise the rules.	1.2439193393386865
The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors, which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro.	1.323349290620126
Since the average European family puts its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and I would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk-spreading are concerned.	1.0891973119091274
The two proposals form a coherent whole.	0.9001066491949117
The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities' (UCITS) can invest.	1.0424099671562677
As already remarked in this session, UCITS are key players within the modern capital markets.	0.849228644074989
Their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets, in which the principle of risk-spreading is taken into consideration, protected by appropriate supervision.	1.1463038003423696
Since diverse types of investment are permitted, private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques.	0.929463243895795
The second proposal expands the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the EU capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector.	1.1324295156779276
By allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross-border basis, these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the Treaty of Rome, which they have been denied for all these years.	1.4062954904766247
The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas.	1.1336193060279744
The Commission will adopt Amendments Nos - and I am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 for the first proposal, and 23, 28 and 32 for the second proposal, since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements.	1.3099364767804207
I also value the ideas put forward in Amendments Nos 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20, although the wording needs to be adapted.	1.0211223598001797
I also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45.	0.8125242948132628
I can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of Amendment No 47.	1.201315484102805
All the amendments I have listed so far pertain to the first proposal.	0.9634167444753564
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the ideas of Amendments Nos 24, 25, 29, 30, 41 and some parts of 27, which contain sensible suggestions, can be adopted, again formulated appropriately.	1.141090092888624
The Commission has suggested adopting the content of these, with certain changes in the wording.	1.3667451117695948
Moreover, I have taken note of the request made by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to codify the entire text, once it has been approved - Amendment No 7 of the first proposal and Amendment No 22 of the second proposal.	1.3959988603740496
The Commission is in favour of codification and will, in the foreseeable future, once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative, concentrate its efforts on drafting a codified version.	1.2739511460036315
However, I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands.	1.3684250986994468
The Commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal.	1.3702723213929096
This is why the Commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal:	1.25154447147063
Amendment No 8 because the proposed, general reference to assets 'covered by this directive' , instead of the more precise reference to assets 'mentioned in Article 19 of this Directive' , hinders implementation.	1.1741443063407977
This Amendment could also lead to different interpretations in the Member States, which might well look for similar instruments in other articles of the directive.	1.0863116474000354
Amendment No 16 jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms.	0.8437571903816452
Neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions.	1.0641230735691156
We cannot, therefore, adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason.	1.0052954993606527
Amendment No 42 relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive.	1.155573652777903
I therefore cannot see any reason why Article 22, paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason.	1.047551035511994
Amendment No 44 cannot be accepted because, if it is prescribed that non-harmonised funds are subject to rules which have been 'imposed by the directive' concerning lending, borrowing, selling from an uncovered position and the third party custodian, this will indeed lead to a situation where very few funds, for example Swiss funds, would be eligible for investment.	1.299084656369495
This goes against the Commission' s intention to widen the scope of investments, and the wording thereof could contravene GATS agreements.	1.2429335794113565
Amendment No 47 is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first paragraph of Article 22a are concerned, because this proposal completely clashes with the spreading rules of Article 22, especially when the UCITS are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospectuses, as discussed in the Council.	1.3309656615551175
The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes.	1.1607258562715508
The Commission points out that, according to the national legislation of some Member States, the use of OTC derivatives for general investment purposes is already authorised.	1.081102397440917
However, the Commission will be suspending its position, given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments.	1.3002349405188627
I believe that OTC instruments could lead to problems, because they are not liquid, the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks.	1.3291051698638492
It seems inconsistent to opt for an extremely prudent approach with regard to investments as non-harmonised funds or deposits and, at the same time, freely to allow investments in clearly more risky OTC instruments.	0.9398972146367625
By rejecting the rapporteur' s Amendment No 39, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has aligned itself with the Council.	1.1194039688766273
The upshot of this amendment by Parliament would be that funds are allowed, in theory, to invest in OTC instruments and to trade the rights of participation in their funds across the entire internal market.	1.2397277410783232
In practice, access to other EU markets for these theoretically harmonised funds which invest in OTC instruments can be blocked by applying different national legislative frameworks and protective measures against OTC investments. This would contravene the fact that EU legislation applies to all funds which invest in OTC instruments.	1.0031002082754876
Given this possibly negative effect on the internal market and the risks inherent in OTC instruments, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 15, 37, 38, 39, 43, 46 and 48 and parts of Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45 which pertain to OTC instruments.	1.0100774531529242
As far as the second proposal is concerned, I already mentioned that the Commission will take into consideration many amendments.	1.3988338453763034
Despite this, there are some amendments which the Commission cannot adopt: Amendment No 26, which does not seem to observe the order in which licences are granted and activities start; parts of Amendment No 27, especially the part where the prevention of conflicts of interests is deleted, the delegation of tasks is restricted to components of management decisions and the general decision-taking of Member States concerning delegation is repealed; Amendment No 31 because the Commission is of the opinion that the application of Article 44 of the directive in unchanged form has proved adequate for the trading in rights of participation in UCITS.	1.2325649058484844
The application of the provisions of the directive concerning the performance of services in the field of investments in securities, better known as ISD, is therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulties or confusion.	1.2681548451610156
Amendment No 33 is ambiguous regarding 'the language' of the guest member state, especially when there are various official languages, and it is questionable what will be gained from translations in two other languages.	1.1555757294188096
Amendment No 34 is unacceptable because a simple deletion of the reference to pension funds can create ambiguity as to whether or not a management company can carry out these activities.	1.0344376707305598
I think that pension funds could also benefit from this possibility, provided that management companies are not lumped together with pension funds, but may only carry out part of the management per delegation.	1.3286571044355018
Amendment No 35 cannot be accepted because legally, it cannot command any authority.	1.152944742689288
Management companies which are denied access to a Member State would need to re-incorporate as a different legal entity in order to be permitted in another Member State.	1.1274296386406932
Amendments Nos 49, 50 and 51, which share the same basis, are not acceptable because they make substantial changes to the consistent approach of the Commission regarding the regulations of third party delegation, and do not offer sufficient security to the competent authorities and investors.	1.349608510423781
I would like to finish off by commenting on the remarks made by a few Members this morning and, Mr President, with your permission, I will do this in English.	1.4044399631082578
First of all, regarding the remarks of Mr Crowley, who asked whether the second proposal could not simply consist in taking over a pure ISD approach; the objections of the Commission to that proposal would be the following: such an approach would pose difficulties which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authorities and non-consistent sets of rules; moreover there would be no provisions whatsoever on conflicts of interest.	1.2234156387662178
For example, a management company might be doing underwriting business and, if not able to sell, it would put the securities in the fund it would manage, or else there might be difficulties in which order business should be executed if the management company did brokering business.	1.3383041305274257
Furthermore the proposal put forward by Mr Crowley would require a change of the ISD which at present - as I am sure he already knows - does not cover collective management business.	1.415358950611419
Lastly, his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render ISD activities.	1.2243235272225352
As regards the question put by Mr Huhne, his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations.	1.0618033770061652
But hedging operations are already allowed in the existing Article 21(1) of Directive 611/85 on UCITS.	1.0245622930258529
So what Mr Huhne wants is already possible.	0.7625909513419054
A question has been put by Mrs Villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management.	0.9993275780161448
That is also something which is allowed under present legislation. I refer to the same Article 21 I referred to in relation to Mr Huhne' s question.	1.3288985902995711
In her question Mrs Kauppi asks why the Commission has prepared a package of measures distributed in two separate proposals. The reason is that the first proposal focuses essentially on the product, while the second proposal focuses essentially on the service provider, and on prospectuses for UCITS.	1.4719870034686668
The separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of problems would facilitate the negotiating process in the Council.	1.0782302054182988
The Commission has not only to listen to Parliament and take into account parliamentary proposals but, as is well-known, must also deal with the Council.	1.5341046280597683
That is the reason why the Commission has put forward these two separate proposals.	1.245761245504255
Lastly, Mr Balfe has complained that there are, in his opinion, too many limits in the whole proposal the Commission has put forward.	1.592150039646016
It seems to us that these limits are justified: firstly, by the need to diversify investments; secondly, because of the vulnerability to the need to reimburse investment at any time; thirdly, in order to avoid an inordinate influence over the investment funds.	1.356636871819865
These are the reasons why the Commission believes, because of the prudence that has to be exercised in this field, that these various limits are necessary.	1.3884759311555879
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place at 12 noon.	0.8806295717638483
Mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States	0.23040450400597556
The next item is the report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union.	0.848847480653575
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in letters dated 3 August 1999 and 3 December 1999, the Council called on the European Parliament, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty, to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the Member States aimed at guaranteeing improved mutual assistance in criminal matters.	1.2869368355650919
It is thus, as you can see, a very important draft, that will effectively serve to provide the Member States of the Union with a more comprehensive and consistent instrument for mutual assistance.	1.604818390308137
In actual fact, there are still certain differences of opinion within the Council over the type of convention, and over certain provisions contained therein.	1.3587926332557871
Some of these differences have already been ironed out, but others persist.	1.4179082022860092
The spirit of the proposal is nevertheless to equip those responsible for applying the law - primarily the judiciary, but also the citizens concerned - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime, which respects fundamental guarantees as regards defence and general principles of human rights.	1.3423762643796784
It is for this reason that, despite the many omissions in the text, the provisions set out therein could - and I say could, Mr President - be accepted on condition that they are suitably amended in order to ensure they can be implemented by those responsible for applying the law and are acceptable to the citizens.	1.45018991726823
The Commission has proposed various amendments to this end, all of which aim to systematically restructure the Council proposal by suggesting a series of technical adjustments that will render the text harmonious and consistent as regards the amendments proposed.	1.1660956502504543
The amendments can be summarised as follows: they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence, introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible, and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications, an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various Member States of the Union.	1.1882918827275375
The proposal, as formulated by the Council and subsequently amended by the Commission, provides for a convention based on three titles: the first lays down guidelines for ensuring the consistency of procedures and formalities for letters rogatory; the second lists a whole series of specific requests for mutual assistance and defines the formalities and procedures which must be followed in relation to these specific types of mutual assistance; the third and last provides for and codifies the procedures via which telephone conversations conducted by citizens in a State other than the one instigating proceedings can and must be intercepted.	1.2271532066336344
Mr President, international cooperation is certainly needed in order to tackle both cross-border crime and crimes which are committed in one State, but the evidence for which is to be found in another.	1.453783112939909
It is nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other, even more delicate issues into account: the whole issue of double jeopardy, that of specialities, and that of the credibility of one Member State of the Union in respect of the judicial authorities of other Member States of the Union.	1.5219478988960378
These are thus extremely important questions, which we hope that the Council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion.	1.3834031129703146
As regards other aspects of this subject, Mr President, I would refer you to my written report.	1.1779142177052417
- (ES) Mr President, I want to start by saying that I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party which I represent on this issue.	0.9965004533760116
I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Council is not present today.	1.3607903272586273
By contrast, I welcome the attentive presence of Commissioner Vitorino, as has consistently been the case since his appointment. This leads me to another point.	1.3574154370289937
This House has only prepared one report on this Convention. It was in fact consulted on a text which was not the text being worked on by the Council and which did not contain points which had already been agreed.	1.3487989970701846
I condemn this, as well as the Council' s absence.	1.4072749184316073
These are serious matters on which this House must act.	1.0672836058935442
We are about to advance into new territory where attitudes and symbols are of great significance.	0.7334298565302771
A political community is reflected in the justice which it hands out.	0.8959817846470982
This is why this report is so important.	1.251268471535852
It represents a step towards the area of freedom, security and, particularly, justice to which we all aspire.	1.3446481201872635
It is also an important step towards European natural justice. This will be built on mutual confidence between the Member States and their respective legal systems and on the confidence of the European people in any European court.	1.4467814860046069
It will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular.	1.1010232650936866
It is in this respect that this House has significantly - and in my opinion rightly - altered the balance proposed by the Council by firmly and decidedly supporting a reinforcement of these guarantees of fair trials in all the amendments.	1.5456341094958603
Mr President, as the rapporteur said, this House has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the Convention.	1.4017672378340889
On behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have tabled an amendment to the motion for a resolution which asks the Council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible.	1.0408462960522196
The regulation of phone tapping in the Council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate.	1.0608978790208612
Yet a lack of regulation is also inappropriate and may lead to abuses in the telecommunications field. In fact, we are aware that these are already happening widely.	1.2730603186329639
The other point which I must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video conferencing with regard to accused persons.	1.1759651996767635
Again on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have asked the Council to produce a convention as soon as possible in order to clarify and supplement the regulation of this issue, which is frankly unsatisfactory.	1.32085519787198
Apart from a few exceptions, the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party will vote in favour of the committee' s amendments, and of course our own.	1.3064687218136894
Mr President, it is our opinion that one facet of the construction of Europe hinges on the construction of a common judicial system, for the Europe that we want to build, which comprises administrative law, civil law, both substantive and procedural, and criminal law, both substantive and procedural.	1.538724080601026
The Convention on Mutual Assistance and Criminal Matters, which we are examining today, is but a stitch in the great fabric of the corpus iuris of Europe, which has its natural foundation in fundamental human rights and freedoms.	1.3242883983355953
Thus it is that legal cooperation and cooperation on criminal matters must also strictly respect fundamental rights, principles which lie at very root of our culture and our civilisation: I am thinking of fair trials, and more particularly of the rights of the defence, of the impartiality and integrity of judges, of the length of legal proceedings, for which my country, Italy, unfortunately has the worst record in terms of the number of sentences handed down, of the cases pending before the European Court of Human Rights.	1.3605405911839936
Restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law.	1.1229196704427276
The report that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has substantially amended with regard to its original formula, taking up many of the amendments we have presented, still leaves room for a certain confusion, in relation to the way in which the interception of telecommunications and video conferences are to be regulated.	1.3467802328500937
The news received in recent weeks on the way in which modern technologies facilitate interceptions mean that greater attention must be paid to this issue: we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and troubled than the dark scenes depicted by Orwell.	1.1253383220024837
This is only the beginning of a great project in the field of law, which should advance hand in hand with the growth the type of Europe we want to see.	1.3794821847157874
Mr President, committee amendments and political group amendments may be tabled in plenary, but not amendments from individual Members.	1.3530472463047511
Mr Schulz should be aware of this.	0.6918550887034
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully understand the frustration of Mr Di Pietro who, in a short space of time, has had to carry out an extraordinary amount of work in order to be able to submit this report to us today.	1.2852055196205254
Crime in the European Union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step-by-step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs.	1.2674429729260788
The European Parliament is certainly not to blame for this.	1.3239709251792875
It is the governments of the Member States who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree.	1.1939542837871626
As a result, the European Parliament is faced with an almost impossible task.	1.2568774889749168
One has to content oneself with the idea that all means, however slight, must be seized upon in order to set up better legal assistance.	1.3118241613009904
By way of paradox, I could say that it would be best if as little as possible was said about this report, for the clearer we make it that only very small steps are being taken, the more the world of crime will gloat and the more the acute imbalance between organised crime and the desperate lack of judicial cooperation will become obvious.	1.3881428683528902
I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council of Ministers to finally face reality, that is to say the fact that crime is developing faster than the law.	1.3802741353425394
The goal is, after all, to provide the judicial bodies - magistrates, in the first place, but also the citizens involved - with the instruments to fight crime without prejudice to the fundamental guarantees of defence and the general principles of human rights.	1.3350725937694514
If not, we will be fighting a running battle.	1.1395148186143984
I therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the EU Member States in the first instance.	1.1875133292686315
In my opinion, this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States.	1.1791749873624693
As long as this harmonisation has not been achieved, however, we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance.	1.269117810953007
To this end, I had submitted an amendment stipulating that legal assistance can only be granted in the event of criminal prosecution instituted by the authorities based on facts which are punishable according to the national law of the petitioning party and the Member State petitioned.	1.341710091907707
The content of my amendment is, in fact, echoed in Amendment No 43, which also stipulates this condition of accrual.	1.261103936193531
This condition of accrual is essential since, in my opinion, the principle of nulla poena sine lege, legality in criminal law, must be observed.	1.0648826049905646
As such, any request for legal assistance concerning a hypothetical action which is not a crime in the petitioned Member State contravenes this principle of legality and thus the fundamental principles of justice in the petitioned Member State.	1.2042422373135764
Hence, it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted.	1.395151993965594
Finally, I would like to reiterate that Mr Di Pietro has, in my opinion, delivered sterling work by submitting a report which, within the limitations, offers all possible guarantees for safeguarding individual human rights and fundamental freedoms.	1.13107268162685
If, however, we would like to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation.	1.3113717690394637
Mr President, my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs.	1.2770797848750508
The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government.	1.0309776716943404
The present proposal is complex, because it deals with agreements between Member States but has far-reaching consequences for the citizen-government relationship.	1.213249795542967
It is precisely in the field of legal protection that the Council' s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired.	1.2598725711109442
In the words of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro, the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings.	1.1372115275882901
Thanks to the agreement, it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests, whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different Member States.	1.229913641392401
The chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court.	1.190737525672053
Additional measures are hence required, such as the obligation on the part of criminal investigators to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used.	1.047668109645246
The fact that the Council' s proposal rides roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my Group.	1.2531356176747426
There are certainly no restrictions in its scope.	0.7670934026371169
As such, the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime.	1.3124976369199053
In fact, it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law.	1.2790962674981528
It is, therefore, conceivable that the European Union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will vanish in the dust.	1.2400092040301325
Mr President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters that we are examining today contains the minimum requirements for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies concerned.	1.0738060550740898
It pertains, among other things, to notifications, information exchanges, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of property, testimonies via video conferences, investigative activities and 'undercover' activities, and the interception of telephone calls.	1.1858389330054284
This is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached, and it should immediately be said that if any amendments, such as Amendments Nos 32 or 81, or the revised Amendments Nos 70 or 71, were to be passed, the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped, and we would vote against it.	1.4514547679562775
I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments.	1.259074996672233
The fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this Parliament.	1.3097540320422603
As Commissioner Vitorino will have noted in all the various speeches, the need has emerged to draw up a framework of common rules, which is to say that we cannot continue in this manner, with this disparate agenda, with these piecemeal agreements which relate to diverse sectors such as that of investigation.	1.4941123310970705
What is, on the other hand, absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the Community, and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible, and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement.	1.3759424655208872
My thoughts turn to what may become of this Community, of these conventions and judicial relations if, for example, a fascist country such as Turkey became a member of the Union. It would truly perplex me.	1.518734491607745
We need a corpus iuris - as everyone has said - and common rules, especially procedural ones, which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the Community.	1.5240357332907415
It is clear that this is primarily an issue for the IGC and one that addresses an aspiration to which this Parliament can only make a limited contribution in as much as everything depends on the Council and the Commission.	1.2825954662349721
I believe that this first half of the year, in which we have a Commissioner from Portugal and Portuguese Presidency of the Council, provides an excellent opportunity to give an initial spur to this shared aspiration.	1.3855313425816111
It is precisely for this reason that we are in favour of adopting Amendments Nos 78 and 79, which already prefigure a minimum of set rules on interceptions and on video conferences.	1.2432107777013144
On the one hand, we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote, precisely so that this convention - which, I repeat, already sets minimum rules - is not stripped of all meaning, while on the other hand we are also looking forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the Commission with a view to definitively putting into effect this minimum Community law.	1.362141368029803
Mr President, confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level, the Member States must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible.	1.2749852381421267
Indeed, they must set in place the institutional conditions needed to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law - a process that must nevertheless cover all the stages needed to prevent the untimely impositions that are detrimental to legitimate national prescriptions in the field of justice, over which Member States have sovereign powers, and above all to prevent impositions that result in riding roughshod over basic civil rights.	1.2830308537326731
We must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the Council which, as the rapporteur himself has underlined, now claims, after years of discussion, to have found a universal solution in the space of a few months.	1.493479072877539
Furthermore - and I agree with the assessment made by Mr Di Pietro - the Council' s text would appear to be overladen with contradictions, inconsistent propositions and omissions.	1.2613016878844399
It is clear that the justice sector, more than any other, cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner.	1.226629407332068
It is the opinion of our Group that even the report, considered as a whole, would be the subject of much debate, notwithstanding the incorporation of certain corrective amendments that take into account the safeguarding of personal liberty and respect for national sovereignties.	1.2898888791745455
The report contains arguments that are too disparate, which do not link together smoothly, and everything thus hinges on approximations.	1.2326600522080182
We will, in conclusion, vote against this report, while stressing that the Europe to which we aspire is a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that call for gradual and responsible discussion, as well as very serious examination.	1.2445748190958819
We must first establish general rules and institutional certainties. Only then will we be able to institute actual conventions.	0.9657523339059156
Mr President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament on the Bonino List, I intend to confirm the position that we adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties and am thus also announcing our vote on their behalf. It is a vote against this report, or more precisely a vote against the convention on which the report is based.	1.3845414696787874
I would nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work. He listened very closely to our arguments at the committee stage, and particularly those on the issue of respecting the rights of the defence, both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of European mutual assistance.	1.2809949351783942
The committee and the rapporteur have incorporated nine of the eleven amendments that we presented, and these centred precisely on the rights of the defence.	1.2591525411935656
This spurs us to maintain that the European Parliament would have done sterling work in guaranteeing that civil rights and freedoms were safeguarded, if this were a lawmaking parliament and if we were, as part of this procedure, in fact co-legislators - which we are not.	1.5699940441840206
This is the problem, and it is for this reason that we are critical of the position adopted by the Council, which is one we find completely unsatisfactory.	1.3984863865403345
This is a task that has lasted three years, and on which we have been consulted, so to speak, as a matter of course, when this issue, as has already been stressed, comprises highly important formal and substantive facets, which called for a range of assessments, consultations, concerted actions and codecisions.	1.3771536081777092
It would seem to us that the Council has taken the various issues - those of legitimate interceptions, the rights of the defence, the rights of detainees and of the authorities legally empowered to request mutual assistance - a little too lightly.	1.4035175543651648
We should have requested and rejected the first version of the convention, and then requested another: the majority on the committee did not want this and it is for this reason that we will vote against it, even if we hope that the amendments, which nevertheless improve the text, can be incorporated by the Council - we doubt that they will be, but hope all the same that they are.	1.5964888991551816
In my Group, there are undoubtedly different views of Mr Di Pietro' s report.	1.1337965017034035
I agree that it is - as has been said - a good and competent piece of work, which has been carried out under difficult conditions.	1.3739507386021055
The Danish Members of the Group cannot vote in favour of the proposal but will, on the contrary, be supporting a number of amendments, especially those tabled by the Greens.	1.5078095085416332
There are two reasons why we are saying no.	1.2487482003816537
Firstly, these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and, to my mind, the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty, which have not been fully realised. This is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support.	1.4498938928172094
The other main reason, however, is that, even though we are concerned here with a Convention (and therefore with international cooperation), there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal. And the trend is towards creating, in the longer term, a common European area of jurisdiction, common EU criminal law and common EU administration of justice.	1.542407654376939
We would warn against that trend. We have this AFSJ mantra - Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - the full enormity of which lies in its establishment of EU systems which will play havoc with existing legal traditions relating to these sensitive and important questions which are overwhelmingly national in character.	1.2081358770597987
Mr President, I too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom, security and justice which Europe will hopefully one day become.	1.4413772619519443
It is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons, in which there are no frontiers to crime, but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime.	1.4128852010280721
A small step - I say - but nonetheless a welcome one, for which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has quite correctly wanted to prescribe further restrictions and guarantees in the name of the defence of the fundamental rights of the individual that are in force in the Member States and in the Union itself, even if these are not yet enshrined in a European Union charter of rights, which we hope will soon come into being: just restrictions and guarantees because, unfortunately, existing rights are, in practice, not always respected by every public authority in every Member State.	1.3690728106798191
Certain isolated passages in the Commission' s proposal perhaps err on the side of caution, as is the case when it is maintained that the detainee accused should be given the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of preliminary enquiries.	1.2608973440282472
I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation.	1.2938409535475357
Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link.	1.2820808282905285
These are nevertheless minor flaws, which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote.	1.5403536517304373
The rapporteur has made laudable efforts, which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him.	1.5247803623596246
The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account.	1.131613626320715
There is, as has already been said, one point still to resolved, which is also the most delicate one: it concerns article 18 of the convention, which relates to the interception of communications originating in one Member State, but which are directly performed by another Member State, without the assistance being requested of the State in which the interception is being carried out, something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology.	1.395161848321226
This is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse.	1.1150058208672766
It could be maintained that in overall terms the legislation proposed is better than nothing, but to the Commission it nevertheless appeared insufficient and far from reassuring.	1.2759944316342986
It thus merits further reflection which, at a time in which the ambivalent reports on ECHELON are evoking shades of Big Brother, should probably go into greater detail on the means and methods to be used, on the one hand, to safeguard the rights of the individual, and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime.	1.317280451204935
The objective is thus to achieve, as closely as possible, a fine balance between the fight against organised crime and respect for personal freedoms and the dignity of the individual: an objective which now specifically applies not only to the Member States, but also to the Union, which is aspiring to become a common area of freedom, justice and security.	1.3592409449730818
This is a distant goal, but is one that can be attained in stages.	1.3754717131672345
The most important thing will be the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States, but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward, as it is a step in the right direction.	1.278048792099935
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement.	0.9886928696008598
It points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal.	0.9390146198223572
The lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty.	0.9584723779593852
Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters.	1.1721704542735705
Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely, and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights.	1.0951239407066615
Article 18 allows interception in another Member State without its involvement.	0.8033019344085552
Not only should this be deleted, the whole interception title should be scrapped.	1.2114387913444822
An initiative of the FBI drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation.	1.0853744069658056
The Council proposal containing those requirements, ENFOPOL 98 was approved by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report.	1.0020998180798601
Now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception, and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at.	1.4208339905054637
The requirements propose to allow the authorities access to the facilities of all service providers, that is, telephones, mobile phones, Internet, etc.; and given the current extremely shoddy drafting, this is open to abuse. I would also like to ask: given that the user requirements specify that the police has access to all service providers without exception, does this include Parliament' s in-house service?	1.2804710517139948
Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very, very shoddy grounds?	1.1504404873797092
Furthermore, in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences.	1.774510415105313
This leaves it wide open to abuse.	0.5251837024776949
Again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof, something which is recognised in international, fundamental law, the presumption of innocence is essential.	1.106506425287329
That is not guaranteed.	1.073296610881466
Neither the preamble nor the body of the text takes proper account of the rights of the defence, a basic principle of international fundamental rights.	1.1032113787055955
This issue is extremely serious.	0.7266756735217469
We are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout Europe which are extremely concerned about these developments.	1.1559791341743395
Mr President, I am neither a member of the Legal Affairs Committee nor a lawyer, but like almost all of us, I understand the need for this Single Economic Area of Europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom, security and justice.	1.4129255970218808
In that sense, the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important.	1.1378272894218409
What did I understand on reading the related texts?	0.7953973163831335
That it is dangerous to rely on the provisions made by the Council.	1.047805982530506
The many contradictions and conflicting views over what Europe is and the many different legal systems could not only lead to confusion and inefficiency but also create dangerous situations.	1.0005959353377074
For example, the situation proposed by Article 18, to which many speakers have drawn attention, where each country, each large country if you will, each country with the technical ability, can enter another country and monitor its telecommunications without even securing the second country' s approval.	1.4211412072729972
In my opinion, the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur Mr Di Pietro have produced some very interesting work.	1.075005235307034
It is a pity that this very well constructed explanatory statement by Mr Di Pietro could not be conveyed in the telegrammatic five minutes he had here today.	1.1266115417222131
Nevertheless, it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries, defendants and citizens, a path which I think must be pursued much more completely and much more boldly.	1.3346791946495116
I should like, however, to draw your attention to the fact that all this is taking place in a framework in which there is confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law.	1.2565983853968243
A child, a student or a pupil who smokes hashish in one country is dealt with in an educational way, while in another country he is treated as a criminal and locked up in the universities of crime constituted by the corrective system and the prisons.	1.117678608762997
How can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis?	0.9641338394402954
For that reason, in conclusion, I believe we should do something, particularly in the area of harmonisation of laws, not those relating to organised criminal activity, but those concerning punishable activities by the people which are more in the nature of social phenomena.	1.4433484405820736
On behalf of the TDI Group, I should like to take the opportunity afforded by Judge Di Pietro' s report on mutual assistance in criminal matters to refer to a case which is a tragic illustration of the way crime is eroding security in Europe.	1.2971516902728062
On 14 December 1999, a five year-old boy called Clément was found in a sleeping-car on the Calais-Ventimiglia train, crying for his mother who was taking him to visit his sick grandmother.	0.9951481143459432
Corinne Caillaux, who had probably been raped, was found with her throat cut and covered in stab wounds in the lavatories on the train.	1.1087549718560943
The presumed killer, Sid Ahmed Rezala, is also strongly suspected of having murdered the British student Isabel Peake, who was raped and thrown out of the train taking her to see her parents, and another young woman, Émilie Bazin, who was found dead in Amiens under a pile of coal in the building where he lived.	1.1263026336173525
Rezala should never have been in France. He arrived from Algeria at a time when, according to the authorities, immigration had been stopped and there was no reason for him to come.	1.1820733029616939
He should never have stayed in France, having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences, which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country.	1.1844310466207522
He should never have been free because 14 charges of theft, violence and rape had been brought against him, one of which was for the rape of a minor.	1.016477613552208
He should never have been able to escape from France, but the officers pursuing him had no jurisdiction and European frontiers have more holes than a sieve.	1.1123738400818504
He should never have arrived in Spain, where he mugged a woman at knifepoint and yet was immediately released by the Spanish authorities.	1.0202206953559987
Today, thanks to the complex networks of sexual deviants, he is in Portugal.	1.043728708010485
Portugal refuses to extradite him on the grounds that he would face a longer prison sentence in France than that provided for in the Portuguese penal code.	1.1527982384852693
I should like to ask the Portuguese minister, the President-in-Office of the Council, to put a stop to this scandal at once.	1.1606629361432028
I should like to ask the House to wake up, at long last, to the appalling situation of the victims of policies for which the establishment, not the yobs, bears full responsibility.	1.3455988305179571
Mr President, this agreement deals with a sensitive issue: cooperation in the field of criminal law.	1.1301796849355707
It is therefore understandable that the Council finds it difficult to agree.	1.2841748361269387
Successful application of this agreement by the Member States requires unanimity within the Council.	1.1678687664569267
Only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice.	0.7157894320853764
This, however, does not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously.	1.4437613659204012
Quite the reverse, in fact.	0.891559791985225
The Council' s proposal must comply with legislation of the national Member States in the field of criminal law.	1.101116797510974
The wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test.	0.9095027758320201
Careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but, above all, by the national parliaments, is therefore of key importance.	1.4630677155047702
Mr Di Pietro' s proposal to omit the current Article 18 regarding intercepting telecommunications, amongst other things, is understandable, although very strict.	1.1721688905059042
The text of Article 18 is ambiguous: he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a Member State in another Member State without the latter' s prior authorisation.	1.1481200128172975
In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State.	1.188616112199209
Proposed additions, such as repeated references to the ECHR, the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of Member States to implement the ECHR, add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement.	1.1992199844941196
I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text.	1.2706542604353033
The Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will, however, despite hesitation, not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote.	1.4102401532470141
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation.	1.200215087398809
This clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much-discussed European citizenship.	0.8727060944273364
On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting.	1.3418343116419875
Pursuant to Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union' s objective is 'to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia' .	1.2378900195227518
The creation of Europol represents one step towards achieving this objective. However, we must take the next step, which is to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to gradually establish a genuine European judicial area consistent with the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	1.1194450324490428
This draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application, at Member State level, of pre-existing conventions on other legal areas. The intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the Member States and in the European Convention on Human Rights.	1.235259734238971
It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue.	1.268947155848916
As for videoconferencing, more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded.	1.170995870246447
The procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights...	1.0491039617221964
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.0993768251480497
Mr President, legislating in criminal matters is often countered, wrongly, with arguments of individual freedom and security.	1.288053053750276
Is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed?	0.8038533162937487
Is one free when security is no longer assured?	0.9011466879898498
Modern criminal law revolves around the quest for a balance, a dialogue between security and freedom.	1.0123273538994784
And this dialogue is open-ended; it adapts to the demands of the day.	1.127466898249863
Nowadays, certain forms of crime are cross-border crimes and it is, of course, in the interests of the Member States to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them.	1.2361999671490307
But the Council' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts.	1.126324749687294
First, the form: the draft convention is vague in the extreme, and this is totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society.	1.355374956457622
It is not just a question of style.	0.869794881733802
We are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter.	1.1060016370628982
Then the content: the Council draft fudges the obvious difficulty caused by widely differing legal systems, varying practices and a total lack of legal public service standards in certain Member States of the Union.	1.067633562797736
It makes provision in article 9 for prisoners held in custody to be transferred from one state to another despite the fact that guarantees differ.	1.0612276706425636
I should like to stress this point because it is paramount.	1.2845223252798106
We must not forget that several tens of thousands of people are currently held in custody in the European Union without having stood trial and that, in some states, custody is abused and used as a means of extorting confessions.	1.2551304567813029
It is nothing less than legal torture.	0.5730747245673508
Other European countries, on the other hand, do not accept confession as sufficient proof of guilt.	1.0832118176787966
It is this diversity in our criminal policies which we have to address and legislating properly means looking for genuine legal convergence criteria and facing up to the reality of prisons in Europe, which are often overcrowded places outside the law which are a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves.	1.2510086768827808
Mr President, as you know, all of our countries abolished the death penalty years ago, but with nearly a thousand suicides a year in our prisons, they have not really abolished it?	1.453385107448936
Mr President, co-operation in the field of law is without doubt essential in free market Europe, but it must hinge on the strictest respect for those principles which lie at the very heart of our civilisation: the fundamental human rights and freedoms, laid down in the European Convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.	1.2798737369164757
We can but thank the parliamentary committees, which have - via the introduction of numerous amendments - made far-reaching modifications aimed at providing guarantees to a report which, in its initial format, we did not find at all convincing.	1.3453183720836657
I turn to Mr Schulz in confirming that we always submit amendments not on a personal basis or for personal motives, but in connection with general political concerns.	1.2762794455496849
If it is then a question of listing the areas investigated or researching these, they can be found with the rapporteurs, among them the author of the report on this convention.	1.2962639684923873
I thus believe that Mr Schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks.	0.890052048642292
As I have said, numerous amendments have been incorporated which guarantee the rights of the defence - I am thinking here of the obligation for interceptions to be requested by a judge - or the prohibition on holding both an investigative and a judicial mandate as part of a joint investigation team.	1.3240463451753006
In brief, this Parliament wanted the convention to apply solely to criminal matters; the restrictions on freedom and on fundamental rights set out in the convention can but be limited to criminal matters.	1.1903779147416333
We need hard and fast rules.	0.4249682349198501
The Council has behaved in an unseemly manner, changing tack in mid-course, and is nowhere to be seen.	1.3388625652797705
We would, on the other hand, like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for attending the debate held in this Chamber.	1.340350822542043
As I have said, we need hard and fast rules if we are to have fair trials in Europe - without intrusion from interceptions, without the illicit use of video conferences - because we in Europe should no longer have trials run by magistrates who play politics rather than administer justice, and because punishment should be meted out to the real perpetrators of crime and not to innocent people who someone finds inconvenient.	1.295281183962107
. Mr President, the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is approaching adoption by the Council.	1.081539672085052
Most say it is about time.	1.1087630476350785
According to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the Council in April 1997, the work on the draft MLA Convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997.	1.4710542364228854
More time will pass before the Convention actually enters into force, given the fact that this requires Member States' ratification.	1.2714109979175297
Even with the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, foreseeing its entry into force once at least half of the Member States have adopted the Convention, I would like to urge the Member States to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this Convention.	1.2965982444608293
Past experience with ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing.	0.9584743824196164
This Convention will not create a new or different system of Mutual Assistance.	1.0024870721622945
Instead it aims at building on tried and tested mechanisms that have been in place for a very long time, such as the ones foreseen by the Council of Europe Convention on mutual assistance of 1959 and the Benelux Treaty.	1.1818335317765998
The draft that the Council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several Members of Parliament.	1.2467428343184317
It is a considerable achievement of the Convention that where at all possible requested Member States shall comply with the formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting Member States.	1.2178729981983258
This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court.	1.088090873568686
Furthermore, requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities.	1.1898958165707474
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of provisions: those that create an obligation to render assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences, controlled deliveries and on the interception of telecommunications; and those where no such obligation is created and only a legal framework is provided for Member States that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribed, for example, the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert investigations and the sending and service of procedural documents.	1.1515836533952266
The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime.	1.081529807744227
It is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations.	1.02368109331242
However, one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence.	1.6790197973361252
I very much appreciate that the report of Mr Di Pietro, whom I salute for the excellent work he has done in such a short period of time, includes the right of defence as one of its main points.	1.3434955900459298
At the present time it is entirely up to the Member States to ensure that those rights are respected under the scrutiny of the Council of Europe' s Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.	1.4072405732373736
It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights, work on which has just begun.	1.1557555719756119
We must recognise that Article 18 concerns what is clearly a controversial decision.	1.0207459292181518
The article was carefully crafted in Council in very lengthy discussions, in order to ensure that intelligence activities would remain effective and that criminal investigations will be covered.	1.0211199217055826
As far as criminal investigations are concerned, for which I am responsible, I take note of the invitation that was addressed to the Commission and the Council by several Members of the European Parliament to take this issue on board and to address it on a common legal basis, having regard to the relevance the interception of telecommunications may have as evidence before the courts.	1.3865693439849889
The Commission is fully aware of the fact that the draft we have before us is not perfect or ideal.	1.336376239778288
However, we must be realistic.	1.4343914303933807
The text we have is the result of the mixture of the institutional set-ups foreseen for judicial cooperation in criminal matters under both the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties respectively.	1.016749775574087
This is what we have, and only practical experience will show us in detail if and where there are shortcomings and what additional steps will have to be taken.	1.3615730221685791
I am quite aware of the fact that the further development of mutual trust and mutual confidence among the judicial systems of the Member States will ease the road we have ahead of us.	1.183386871933638
Apart from that, the Tampere European Council has already indicated in which direction we, in the Commission, should go.	1.5448895272839667
Among the steps to be taken will be the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the setting-up of the Euro Just project.	1.3010912976691824
The Commission sincerely hopes that the European Parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields.	1.2721029225913731
I do not expect you to wave through or rubber stamp everything you are confronted with in the coming years.	1.0768388204754393
I am counting more on the European Parliament to be not only a critical observer, as it has been in this case, but also an active player in taking the Union forward in the fight against crime.	1.4525689908284352

II. the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) with a view to regulating management companies and simplified prospectuses (COM(1998) 451 - C4-0465/1998 - 1998/0242(COD))	0.9833278979061223
Goebbels (PSE).	0.6278385542080048
(FR) Madam President, when a Swede, a Spaniard, a Luxembourgeois and a German have to negotiate in English, linguistic ambiguities will arise.	1.319549135703702
I therefore propose, in agreement with the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, that the words 'issued by' be replaced with 'dealt with' throughout Amendment No 37.	1.270456417496953
The words 'issued by' also need to be added after the words 'transferable securities' .	1.1040437502722558
The amended text will then read, and again I must read it in English, which is the lingua franca of our Parliament: 'transferable securities issued by over the counter derivatives dealt with' , etc.	1.1595747659874511
We must also ensure that Amendment No 45 by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil is amended if it is to be adopted, because the same problem will arise.	1.243240226537161
Mr Goebbels, I am sorry, but I think you are jumping the gun; Amendment No 37 is an oral amendment proposing that the words 'with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale' be moved. You were asking for the place to be changed.	1.2583532338855394
Madam President, my apologies, I was looking at Amendment No 36, which logically precedes Amendment No 37.	1.5673367059475882
But, you are right, we are discussing Amendment No 37 and here too we have a similar problem.	1.5546446787383672
It is not the establishments but the instruments which should have a high rating.	1.430353888222459
The text therefore reads: 'instruments with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation' .	0.7562036532765554
My apologies once again for my mistake.	0.7918439552645997
Are there any objections to this oral amendment?	0.7658220186130916

(Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions in two separate votes)	1.0950890706576328
Madam President, I asked for the floor before the sitting started in order to say something solely intended for you as President of this House. We have a procedure for visits to be made to this House to report on certain situations.	1.5178472980858555
I do respect and agree with this procedure, as I also agree with the freedom of expression for everyone. However, for the second time in a fortnight these visits have been used to attack individuals, political parties, including my own, and institutions.	1.467384731638268
I feel that this behaviour, particularly in your presence, is unacceptable and totally repugnant, especially when we are on the point of an electoral campaign.	1.3399261556816715
Therefore, particularly out of respect for you, I must say that I do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this.	1.3786624754172805
I was told that this was a personal response.	1.139629359085861
Note will be taken of it in the Minutes.	1.1420182015752853
Madam President, particularly out of respect for you, for myself and for this House, I did not want to explicitly refer to the issue in question. However, as a Member of this House, as general secretary of a party in the Basque Country and as an ordinary citizen of Spain, I will do so now because of the extremely serious accusations made against individuals and against parties like my own, which has a long democratic tradition, and which has scrupulously respected and defended human rights for many years.	1.5335761816947144
Madam President, I want to express my concern that this clear defence by Mr Knörr Borràs of human rights apparently does not prevent his government from cooperating in Parliament with a political group which not only does not condemn, but collaborates with and encourages, violence against people and property.	1.249396674547745
I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject.	1.318057154449299
We are not going to enter into a debate now.	1.104772566760432
I shall give you the floor for any points of order after the vote.	1.0960832270979215

Madam President, I want to condemn the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council.	0.8551911185570608
On Third Pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice, it is unacceptable for the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to be absent.	1.0683410687947752
I also want to mention the translation problems, of which I will give just one example, as we do not have much time.	1.617987633505288
Correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts.	0.9228258657861583
Amendment No 83 in Italian, which is the original version, states that 'il minore deve essere assistito da una persona di sua fiducia o da un perito o legale esterno' .	0.902861181783513
The term 'legale esterno' has been translated into French as 'avocat neutre' . I have no idea what an 'avocat neutre' is.	1.2283627235460928
It rather seems like a contradiction in terms.	0.5568017804080836
However, in the Spanish version the 'abogado' has disappeared completely.	1.31624368332097
Madam President, you have said several times that this is a very serious problem.	1.685152526672589
The lawyer-linguists should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version is produced.	1.0517087577373085
Quite, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this is not the first time and it is indeed most worrying.	1.4464733777815089
We shall address this problem and check all the translations.	0.8958446156736493
Madam President, I simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote started, to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar.	1.487164485561423
I should like you, Madam President, to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future.	1.5048979479127458
Quite, I am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and I shall be most happy to pass this on.	1.3247520794978307
Relating to Amendment No 31	0.26217440790759694
Madam President, in the phrase which reads 'Where consent to the transfer is required from the person concerned' , the words 'under the national law of the requesting or requested Member State' should be added after 'Where' .	1.2536814315929252
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	0.20589797145868632
Madam President, in the heat of the moment I forgot to mention that, in my report on the excessive deficit procedure, the last paragraph of the explanatory statement contains a mistake in the Spanish version.	1.3504231024882065
An 's' has been omitted and instead of reading 'la propuesta nos parece correcta' , it reads 'la propuesta no parece correcta' which is completely the contrary.	1.0844939272815834

I hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this.	1.0959933021538015
The second sentence should read: '.., weshalb diese Hilfen' (which is why we have this aid), then 'ohne Bedingungen und' (unconditionally and) should be deleted, and it continues as follows: 'ohne Abhängigkeit von reziproken Anweisungen von seiten des Geberlandes gewährt werden müssen' . (and therefore that the aid must not be dependent on the reciprocal orders from the donor countries).	1.3441108462447193
This clarification would certainly meet with our approval.	0.7642511553622513
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?	0.7998026154310872
(Parliament agreed to the oral amendment) - Relating to Amendment No 9	0.9624388845124067

	-0.0
Madam President, I would like, with reference to this report, to underline the problem of translation: reference should be made to the French or Italian version, since the text adopted by this Parliament will also be the authoritative one for the Commission.	1.455206638246646
We have encountered several problems in some of the other languages, but have not been able to check all of these, and I would thus urge you to be mindful of problems of this type.	1.4060038864973414
Madam President, I voted in favour of the Schmidt report on the regulation of investments in transferable securities because, as I stated in this Chamber this morning, I consider it very important that the monies of the citizens of the European Union be put to good use.	1.4638028061901578
The vast majority of these citizens are elderly people and pensioners, who want a peaceful retirement and who, after the problems encountered during the course of their working lives, have at last found financial peace of mind.	1.288966711424605
The regulation of investments in transferable securities, the vast majority of which are made by elderly pensioners, is thus a major step forward for the European Union.	1.262390433891519
Report by Olle Schmidt (A5-0025/2000)	0.7745447143983618
. (SV) Olle Schmidt' s report is an improvement on the Commission' s proposal.	1.0988034942998577
I am not opposed to updating the common minimum regulations enabling a collective investment undertaking to obtain a so-called EU passport.	0.9406288371421319
However, I do not consider it would be appropriate to do this before all Member States have approved Commissioner Monti' s proposal for minimum taxes on capital.	1.5169808765921011
In its present form, the report will contribute to further liberalisation of the capital markets, in spite of the fact that what is most important is to restrain them.	1.3102112153711385
Like the whole of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I have therefore voted against the proposal to amend Directive No 1 and have abstained from voting on the proposal to amend Directive No 2.	1.2191891643763237
Brok report (A5-0029/2000)	0.5583549094232405
Madam President, there has recently been much talk of the importance of enlarging the European Union.	1.2560046570933785
We have before us Malta and Cyprus, which are two States keen to become members.	1.1961070441177712
Given that the complexity of the procedures has been greatly reduced, I voted in favour not only because this measure addresses the need for cohesion between these applicant States and the Union, but also because I believe that this should be taken as an invitation from Parliament to the Council and the Commission to ensure that Cyprus and Malta become fully-fledged members of the European Union as swiftly as possible.	1.4736374340018787
.	-0.0
(FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta, whose accession is vital to the future of the European Union in the Mediterranean.	1.1228298155330627
The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for Cyprus and Malta, starting in the year 2000 and lasting for five years (2000-2004).	1.1344130174573237
The proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire.	0.8870910171474083
This new move follows on from the step taken at the Helsinki European Council last December, when it was decided that Malta had made sufficient progress to warrant opening bilateral conferences in February 2000, i.e. by the end of this month, in order to commence negotiations on the conditions of accession to the Union and the adjustments required.	1.2244062675527287
As far as Cyprus is concerned, although the Council stated that a political settlement would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. It also stated that its decision on accession would be made without the above being a precondition, which I welcome.	1.2313802224517973
I have, in fact, always thought that insisting on a settlement of the present situation, in which one-third of this republic' s territory is occupied by Turkey, before starting negotiations with Cyprus was quite unfair.	1.2820715848163742
On a more general note, it is true that the socio-economic situation in these two countries is far better than in other candidate countries.	1.229014065312272
However, they have received technical assistance and financial aid from the European Union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire.	1.4850112747867978
Until 1999, this technical assistance and financial aid was provided under the fourth financial protocols (B7-4011).	1.0999443334654302
Both countries also qualify for financial aid under the MEDA programme (B7-4012).	0.8779938013031094
During the first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament stressed that the new 'pre-accession' heading (B7-0), proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget, should not be limited to the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe and should also be extended to Malta and Cyprus.	1.3000350062943729
However, because of the Council' s refusal to negotiate a review of the ceiling set for heading 7 (pre-accession) in the Financial Perspectives, the European Parliament agreed, by way of exception, and I stress that it was by way of exception, that this expenditure should be financed under heading 4 (external action) of the Financial Perspectives for the year 2000.	1.5148192841070287
At the same time, the European Parliament created a new heading: 'pre-accession strategy for Mediterranean countries' (B7-04), under which two new articles were created for the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus pending the Commission' s presentation, following the Helsinki European Council, of the necessary legal bases and a review of the ceiling for heading 7 of the Financial Perspectives.	1.3552880019678293
This proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases!	1.0775493382425252
. I welcome Mr Brok' s report supporting with amendments the Commission' s proposals seeking to prepare Cyprus and Malta for EU membership.	1.3271460158615827
The package will grant around Euro 15 million in total for the two countries in the current year.	1.0744788550642135
It is, however, regrettable that the Commission has eschewed multiannual financing and decided instead to allocate funds on a yearly basis.	1.1500117923412594
This is bound to have an impact on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan spending.	0.8971192905448022
The funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the Community 'acquis' .	1.1630246391003267
Given the already advanced state of these two countries, compared to other applicants, this should easily allow them to be 'technically and administratively' ready for membership at the end of the 5-year programme.	1.3057814796477731
Cederschiöld report (A5-0020/2000)	0.5048110637743843
.	-0.0
(FR) As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the last parliamentary term, I welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increasing protection for our single currency.	1.2617119207537162
The Union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting.	0.9001523455741162
Consumers and traders are still not familiar with the euro and it would be easy for counterfeit money to be passed in supermarkets, bureaux de change and banks and not be noticed straight away.	1.1006663294475838
And the fact that coins are to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify.	1.0107470253270792
The European information centres, which are already playing a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency, should step up their campaigns to raise public awareness of counterfeiting.	1.1753797435661364
On another level, we must ensure that Community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting.	1.1653815546789612
As far as criminal sanctions are concerned, measures are needed to guarantee protection for the euro from the outset and this is the purpose of the draft framework decision on increasing protection by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting presented by the European Parliament.	1.2873562053021856
The purpose of the framework decision is to supplement the provisions of the International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency of 20 April 1929 and to facilitate its application by the Member States.	1.0569580479636878
Each Member State must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable.	1.4097143254312128
These offences must be punishable even if they relate to banknotes and coins denominated in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 January 2002.	0.91590367134213
This is a basic element of the decision.	1.3305461728782182
I cannot but support the rapporteur in deploring the fact that the present national currencies from which the euro is to take over are not protected.	1.380398859128358
We must bear in mind that national currencies could continue to change hands for another 20 years!	0.9042513117951125
They should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation.	0.8437297209803969
It would also appear to be in the Union' s interest for all Member States to help protect the euro, especially Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Greece, which will not be introducing the euro on 1 January 2002.	1.5598044217446423
Although this framework decision is a step in the right direction, it confines itself to increasing criminal sanctions by harmonising substantive criminal law in the form of minimum standards.	1.0491872610124928
There is still no uniform criminal legislation on counterfeiting and there are 15 different national systems.	1.0633445401623245
That brings us back to the more general need to approximate criminal law called for by the European Council in Tampere.	1.098902384891398
.	-0.0
(DA) Mrs Cederschiöld' s report reflects an extremely peculiar form of logic. The EU introduces a common currency.	1.3614835987382135
The risk of counterfeiting increases. Counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire EU; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State.	1.1736661884287924
The harmonisation of criminal law or the introduction of minimum legal standards should not be legitimised against the background of problems of one' s own creation but from considerations of reason and necessity.	1.00177334949239
There is nothing to indicate that the Member States' legal principles, legal traditions and carefully tailored legal systems should be lost for reasons to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeiting. Nor, in the light of the international convention of 20 April 1929, can there be any confusion as to which country should deal with any criminal cases.	1.2368203708394279
We are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the abandonment of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such flimsy grounds. Instead, the focus should be upon preventing the real problem.	1.194228720840958
. I welcome this proposal to protect the Euro against forgers.	1.5499514117733413
When the notes and coins come into circulation after 1 January 2002, everything possible must be done to ensure maximum confidence in the Euro.	1.098154662508112
Di Pietro report (A5-0019/2000)	0.6476537823717314
Madam President, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party, there have been many occasions on which I have stated, at the committee stage, that the European Union must intervene in regulating the lives of the elderly, and in the measures and rules on pensions, as is already the case, in coordination.	1.459471846872719
Similarly, as concerns the field of justice and criminal law, which we have discussed today, I believe not only that the different criminal law, juridical and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated, but also that we must at last formulate common standards: an offence committed in Italy must also be viewed as an offence in Great Britain, Spain or elsewhere.	1.4564310661722475
I believe that we, the Parliament of the European Union, who are the elected representatives of the citizens, must give sharper impetus to ensuring that the European Union provides for the regulation of every facet of the lives of its citizens, including that of justice, and that of pensions.	1.5068694764336379

We vote against this report, because by allowing trans-border interception of telecommunication and reversing the burden of proof, the Convention will create the legal ground for large scale bugging operations in the EU.	1.1456810819424255
That means, making a European bugging system like the transatlantic spying operation 'Echelon' perfectly legal.	0.900079060635185
This Convention will lead to gross abuses of people' s rights to privacy.	1.0873916236330532
It is a major threat to civil liberties in EU.	1.1886786917472685
Also the following points are unacceptable for us: joint investigation teams, controlled deliveries, undercover investigations, inaccuracy of the text on the scope of the convention, lack of respect of the principle of proportionality, lack of democratic guarantees.	1.1084985097844893

. Commissioner Prodi pointed out that 'Africa is our responsibility' and not apparently that of the USA and other major countries.	1.1842256446064585
I worked in Africa 30 years ago, and it was poor and underdeveloped but the problems are now more catastrophic.	1.2501782705970717

(FR) In its communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, the Commission repeats that Europe needs to become a 'global actor' capable of speaking with a strong voice in the world.	1.0845044452611818
What should this global actor' s objective be?	0.9771322052009198
Doubtless our citizens would say something along the lines of 'to defend the countries of Europe better' , since that is the traditional and primordial purpose of political associations.	1.2308900561446272
And yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen.	0.7050361627662873
All we find are vague phrases about 'strategic partnerships' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of Europe would apparently bring with it.	1.0329769440823913
The omission of this principal objective is highly revealing.	0.7800655491560895
It demonstrates one of the main flaws in the European Union, a little-known, almost always implicit flaw, but one which goes a long way towards explaining our citizens' loss of interest.	1.4075003700846798
There is a highly revealing passage on this point in the work programme for the year 2000 attached to the strategic guidelines.	1.3872432879011192
Addressing the fundamental question of relations with the United States, the Commission mentions just one priority: 'we will endeavour to reduce and eliminate as far as possible the disputes in transatlantic trade' (page 4).	1.2253074897043208
While we are on the subject, where one would expect a firm declaration of intent to defend European interests in the numerous trade conflicts under way, one merely finds the desire to eliminate conflict, which hardly sounds like determination on the part of the Commission to fight its corner.	1.2910230379802161
How strange that the Commission should lose its instinct for self-preservation just as Europe is integrating.	1.0921352140115588
I think there are three reasons for this: 1) in their endeavour to transcend the nation states, the European institutions have lost touch with the people and, in losing touch with the people, they have become putty in the hands of foreign interests; 2) having lost touch with the people, the men and women working in these institutions have started to become used to reasoning not as the sole champions of the people, but as international officials in charge of regulating a global system; 3) integration may afford economies of scale and productivity gains; but it also causes far more to be lost because, when it breaks nations, it breaks subtle expressions of solidarity and, with them, the willingness to present a united front.	1.4120001076513011
. (FR) I share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction expressed during the debate.	0.9336255304477461
I do, of course, understand the constraints of the moment and I am prepared to entertain the idea of the risk of failure....	1.2689185221317927
However, experience has taught me that, in politics, modest ambitions are never the key to success!	1.3959336444320147
I shall not keep saying that I am disappointed, because you need to hope in order to be disappointed.... and I have had no hope since the investiture debate.	1.6078174629062905
As for the future, given that the Commission has shown itself incapable of taking action against fascism in Austria, I am convinced that blocking measures to liberalise the single market is the only way of administering a salutary electric shock treatment to the heart of all the countries in the Union.	1.3536475512948045
- (IT) On behalf of the Italian Communists, I would like to express great dissatisfaction at the contents of the document, which was expected to define the strategic guidelines for Europe up until the year 2005.	1.3566442805843522
Employment: for many years now, the connection between economic growth and an increase in employment has not been borne out by reality, and yet, despite the fact that it has been proved to be useless, the same recipe is being put forward again as a solution to the acute problem of unemployment.	1.384477280403031
And yet our President is a fine economist.	0.8861117447531645
Pensions: The document states that, 'Member States must remain responsible for modernising social protection systems' , and yet the Commission itself intervened in the case of Italy, repeatedly calling for swift changes to the pension system to reduce rights and decrease pension payments.	1.3585254850397004
And yet President Prodi himself gave firm guidance to the Italian Government during those years and is therefore aware of the nature and extent of the sacrifices demanded of our fellow citizens and which they made in order to sign up to the euro, and he is aware of the major role played by Italy in European development.	1.2133764069025654
