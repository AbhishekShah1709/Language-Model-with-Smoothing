In this paper the current knowledge of the role of C- pneumoniae in coronary artery disease is reviewed and possible pathomechanisms are discussed.	0.7581987267116825
Preeclampsia is a disorder specific to pregnancy which can affect all maternal organs.	0.39086185598777545
Cerebral involvement with the occurence of convulsions is the defining factor for eclampsia.	0.3409245318971754
The most prominent signs of cerebral dysfunction include headache, hyperreflexia, visual disturbances, confusion and/or altered state of consciousness.	0.4973304358385807
Patients usually recover completely however some patients remain disabled due to cerebrovascular damage.	0.2764577854592642
Intracerebral and subarachnoidal hemorrhage are severe however rare complications of eclampsia.	0.3273179459244463
TCD investigations regularly find vasospasm in all great cerebral arteries.	0.24785635063336536
Reversible hypodense lesions in the white matter on early CT-scans and increased signal intensities on T2-weighted MRT images indicate local edema.	0.44160046418083887
The etiology of preeclampsia and eclampsia remains unknown and its current pathophysiology is still hypothetical.	0.4607689008199816
The clinical picture may best be explained by an endothelial dysfunction with increased vascular sensivity to circulating pressure agents as well as by a structural endothelial lesion with fluid loss from the intravascular compartment.	0.5498610907566939
This article reviews the surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability.	0.6652554116623589
The treatment rationale includes exact definition of the instability pattern ("envelope-of-motion" of the tibia) by clinical examination, arthrometry and stress radiography.	0.7370812123460023
Exact evaluation of the osseous anatomy is mandatory to identify an eventual varus morphotype.	0.4752611273728993
This osseous variant in combination with posterior/posterolateral instability should be treated by an osteotomy in every case.	0.5917896269222498
The technique of additive osteotomy to correct varus and increase the sagittal tilt of the proximal tibia is described.	0.5341553948616915
Ligament reconstruction in chronic posterior knee instability must address the posterior cruciate ligament and the lateral/posterolateral structures in many cases.	0.5185923140304619
Patellar tendon grafts, quadriceps tendon grafts or hamstrings can be used for posterior cruciate ligament replacement.	0.5738406811774599
Arthroscopic or mini-open techniques may be used for graft placement, direct posterior fixation of the graft via a posterior incision is an option for patellar tendon grafts.	0.6315712858984064
Bousquet's biceps plasty or Clancy's biceps tenodesis may be used for posterolateral stabilization; a biceps tendon strip can also be used for lateral collateral ligament reconstruction.	0.5316047718813363
Results of surgery are still moderate.	0.37219814198965323
In the author's series of chronic posterior/posterolateral instability, 26 cases were treated with posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and biceps tenodesis.	0.6608356738720718
Follow-up at 18 months demonstrated increased stability (mean residual posterior drawer 8 mm at 70  Â° and 20 lb force) and improved knee function (33 % IKDC B, 67 % IKDC C).	0.701921693386205
Presently, surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability should be restricted to centers devoted to this problem.	0.7053761806199497
This article reviews the current state of consensus reached for the diagnosis of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy on the basis of conventional histopathological and immunohistochemical methods for inflammatory infiltrates in addition to molecular biological methods for persistence of viral genome in endomyocardial biopsies.	0.5302913480316446
Health policy in Germany has in recent years given priority to the self-administration of physicians, sickness funds, and hospital associations.	0.5831073473490569
Hence, legal regulations on quality assurance have focused on defining responsibilities and areas of primary importance, while precise processes are being defined by the self-administration.	0.5632692075227487
As prices for health care are increasingly restricted by lump sum payments, quality and quality assurance become more important as a factor in competition between health care providers.	0.5524639616210894
To support the implementation of quality assurance in the health care system, the German Federal Ministry of Health has funded model-projects, e.g., to support the adaptation of successful strategies of total quality management for health care.	0.7338244742565991
The research field of tissue engineering combines cells biology, biomaterial science, and surgery.	0.5719998991376237
Major long-term goals are tissue and organ replacement therapies using the patients' own cells.	0.5971211760168877
Our work is focused on the treatment of severe joint defects and on plastic surgery using in vitro engineered cartilage tissues.	0.5361077433497755
The practical approaches in cartilage engineering face problems with three-dimensional cell distribution or cell immobilization raising biocompatibility problems.	0.36774387206184084
The tissue engineering of cartilage is based on combining biocompatible cell embedding substances such as fibrin, agarose, alginate, hyaluronic acid and fiber fleece scaffolds of poly -hydroxy acids (PLLA/PGLA).	0.35171709795624095
Different technical approaches were established: a) three-dimensional in vitro cultures of chondrocytes for the development of vital tissue transplants and b) interacting three-dimensional cultures consisting of different cell populations, such as BMP-transfected mesenchymal cells.	0.5238173651950898
The preshaped artificial tissue constructs were cultured in perfusion chambers to maintain a stable diffusion of nutrients during the in vitro pre-formation step.	0.42689725746233653
Subsequently, pre-formed tissues were implanted into nude mice and into 4mm articular joint defects of rabbits.	0.3417340723003479
Transplants were found to produce cartilage typic morphological patterns and matrix.	0.467911704554482
80% of the transplants remained stable in vivo.	0.5012310394213243
However, 20% of the tissues are resorbed or replaced by a fibrous tissue.	0.5833826416415587
These results demonstrate that current artificial cartilage transplants are already feasible for plastic reconstruction.	0.3399940304997851
The treatment of severe joint defects, however, faces additional problems which are addressed in ongoing studies: (a) the fixation of engineered cartilage in joints, (b) the protection against chronic inflammatory degradation, and (c) the required enormous mechanical stability.	0.7399521721431297
Background: Silicon-rubber central venous catheters have become commonplace in the care of premature infants.	0.4301372196363879
We report on a rare complication, fracture and cardiac embolization of a silicone-rubber catheter and its interventional retrieval.	0.5749960854745287
The ARO multicenter study intended to show clinical and radiological differences with regard to different systems of fixation and designs of the prothesis in total hip replacement in patients with hip dysplasia, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.	0.5368755209346793
In 1987 and 1988 5255 total hip prothesis were implanted by the 24 hospitals which took part in the study.	0.4546864523447156
3133 prothesis (95,6 %) were clinically and radiologically examined.	0.6960564365374267
The follow-up period averaged 6.9 years.	0.8364991131000669
The results of the Aro multicenter-study showed that despite difficult preoperative conditions especially in cases of rheumatoid arthritis the satisfaction rate improved remarkably.	0.518775496250885
During the operation less complications arose in comparison to patients with hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis.	0.6306430760295126
Regarding the rate of infection after operation there were no differences between the 3 groups.	0.7549575837801623
Only the rate of postoperative luxation concerning rheumatoid patients turned out to be twice the number of the others.	0.5043147926729575
In our opinion this is due to the fact that these rheumatics were operated by posterior approach.	0.552942838708557
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis were satisfied most with their surgeries.	0.32825870755281567
Results of rheumatic patients according to Harris hip score were slightly worse than the results of the two other groups.	0.6294453076406207
This was due to systemic involvement and bad preoperative function of the hip.	0.5771483975414765
As a result of the study there were no differences in using cemented or cementless techniques for rheumatic hip replacement.	0.6835077985569926
The decision for the method of fixation should depend on the patient's ability to relief the prothesis after operation.	0.6444567809476238
The study has shown that cementless implantation can also be used for young rheumatics provided that a suitable design of prothesis will be selected.	0.5470836950381115
Sepsis developing on the basis of a postoperative infection is a rare, but life-threatening event.	0.73069920787374
Early diagnosis of postoperative complications usually facilitates decisive intervention and a favorable prognosis.	0.5364556460076499
If the right moment is missed, endothelial damage leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and generalized systemic infection (SIRS).	0.49034993062274
For the subsequentially developing septic shock, often combined with multiple organ failure (MOF), it is not important whether the starting point was an uncontrollable infections focus, ischemic damage following hypovolemic shock, or massive bacterial translocation with postoperative bowel obstruction.	0.554493932391983
The collapse of the immune system results in immune paralysis and explains the inability of the organism to defend itself against systemic infections.	0.4086130852642324
For early recognition of the developing septic complication and its effective treatment, pathophysiological and clinical issues are discussed.	0.45944236319963655
The comparison of prediction of mortality and sepsis by different score systems was the objective of this retrospective study in 51 patients.	0.5907461177665524
Specific scores for burned patients - "Abbreviated Burn Severity Index" (ABSI) and the "Baltimore Sepsis Scale" (BSS) were compared with the general intensive score systems: "Mortality Prediction Model" (MPM II), "Simplified Acute Physiology Score" (SAPS II), APACHE II (ApII), "Hannover Intensive Score" (HIS) and the sepsis score developed by Elebute and Stoner (ES).	0.7466544804004707
On days 1 and 3 the true-positive ratio (sensitivity) was plotted against false-positive ratio (1-specifity) for each score.	0.7491722920475742
The area under the curve (max.	0.38976850345302827
0.5) correlates with the quality of the score system.	0.7627267033431002
We also tested the discrimination of septic and nonseptic patients by using the different scores.	0.5637050782293993
Bilateral symmetric changes in the cerebral hemispheric white matter are found with increasing frequency using CT and MRI techniques.	0.5736962246727445
These unspecific canges of the white matter signal are often called leukoaraiosis.	0.3365315377544811
They differ from the normal white matter signal.	0.4797570720796457
These changes are found with increasing frequency in persons older than 60 years and also patients with dementia and cerebrovascular diseases.	0.5650783703729128
The pathogenesis, clinical significance and morphological substrate are unclear.	0.49977548854226544
The aim of this review is to summarise the actual knowledge about the etiology and clinical signs and symptoms found in patients with leukoaraiosis.	0.8568063032249893
This term should not be used when white matter changes are found in patients younger than 35 years, with an unilateral onset, asymmetric distribution, and extensive changes all over the infra- and supratentorial white matter area.	0.7415968583699091
Neuroradiological and clinical criteria are given to differentiate between leukoaraiosis and diseases of the white matter, especially enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces, lacunar infarction, subcortical arteriosclerotic angiopathy (Binswanger's disease), leukoencephalopathy of different origin, and demyelinating diseases.	0.538288495619655
A case with various skeletal abnormalities, soft tissue masses and skin lesions diagnosed as Proteus syndrome is reported.	0.5270241176194193
Proteus syndrome is included in the differential diagnosis of many disorders, because of the polymorphous nature of its clinical manifestations.	0.612774987870735
It is a rare disorder and leads to functional disabilities as well as cosmetic and psychological problems.	0.734301058052298
Early diagnosis and careful follow-up with appropriate surgical interventions is important in preventing long-term complications.	0.6890577295631143
The value of elective PTA in stenoses of the supraaortic vessels and especially of the carotid artery is still under discussion.	0.561979966680132
Stenoses after surgical and/or radiation therapy and a high cardio-vascular risk for a surgical procedure, however, justify minimal-invasive techniques.	0.6497038363528974
Profiles of fundamental frequency sound pressure levels and voice duration are measured separately in clinical practice.	0.4413071536581748
It was the aim of the present study to combine the two examinations, in order to estimate the relationship between pitch, sound pressure level and voice duration and to develop a new computer-assisted graph.	0.7152724090360534
A three-dimensional (3D) wireframe phonogram was constructed based on SPL profiles to obtain a general view of the parameters recorded.	0.48828727978907965
We have termed this "phonetography".	0.28615121536217575
Variable further projections were selected for the analysis of different aspects of parametric relationships.	0.3853032938633815
The results in 21 healthy volunteers and 4 patients with hyperfunctional dysphonias demonstrated that there were three typical figures of the 3D phonograms produced, depending on the relationship between voice duration when soft ("piano") compared to loud ("forte").	0.6381220174753038
In one-third of the healthy volunteers, the values of the piano voice duration were greater than those of forte for almost all pitches examined.	0.6648166170223008
In two-thirds of the healthy subjects the values of forte voice duration were partly greater, as were those of piano voice duration.	0.6107933690796079
All of the patients showed voice duration values greater for forte than for piano.	0.662197957036969
The results of the study demonstrate that the 3D phonogram is a useful tool for obtaining new insights into various relationships of voice parameters.	0.7006476584798133
Sinus histiocytosis is as a rule a benign disease of lymph nodes, infiltrated by large histiocytes.	0.5084058251486854
These cells show typical cytophagocytosis, particularly lymphophagocytosis.	0.4555257769648654
Other organs may be also involved by this disease, often including the skin.	0.49348012731483387
Exclusive cutaneous sinus histiocytosis without infiltration of lymph nodes seems to be very rare.	0.5493132096232618
To exclude other non-X histiocytoses or histiocytosis-X, it is advisable to use immunohistochemistry.	0.536788715298548
We report on a patient with sinus histiocytosis and discuss the problems of differential diagnosis.	0.6263495849816078
The case of a five-year-old girl with intractable fluor vaginalis and recurrent perianal fistulas is reported.	0.5584823675387676
A presacral dermoid cyst was shown to be the cause of these symptoms.	0.6994992611741976
Extensive radiological investigation revealed the cyst and the associated fistulas extending into the perianal region and the vagina.	0.4556407875190736
After verification of the anatomical situation, an uneventful surgical procedure was carried out.	0.7665479739971601
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a noninvasive functional method for the study of solid tumor perfusion, metabolism and interaction with different therapeutic agents.	0.6370115406934176
The aim of the study was the investigation of the metabolism of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and the kinetics during a treatment with intratumoral ethanol by PET.	0.7903536415228818
The ongoing study includes seven patients with child A cirrhosis and HCC (UICC stage III-IVA; tumor size 3-6 cm).	0.5769926778701253
Dynamic PET studies (60 min) with 18F-fluordeoxyglucose (FDG) were performed prior to therapy to assess tumor viability.	0.7900984100960408
The evaluation of the FDG data demonstrated a liver-equivalent uptake in six of the tumors (well and moderately differentiated HCC), which were poorly delineated against the normal liver parenchyma.	0.6639244962688657
One moderately differentiated HCC showed an increased FDG metabolism, indicating no correlation between histology and metabolism.	0.5307573328932339
A dose of 37-80 MBq 11C-ethanol was applied together with a nonlabelled therapeutic dose of the drug via a puncture needle positioned under sonography.	0.5368459250777404
Five out of seven tumors demonstrated a high 11C uptake shortly after the end of the ethanol injection followed by constant 11C-ethanol concentration during the whole study period of 45 min.	0.47210104972744404
The PET data demonstrated no significant elimination of the 11C-ethanol from the tumor and no accumulation in the surrounding liver tissue.	0.6011056053124167
One case showed a decrease of the intratumoral 11C-ethanol concentration due to a punkture of a tumor vein, and in another case the surrounding liver parenchyma demonstrated significant 11C uptake in the early phase following paratumoral injection of the drug.	0.8176801634576505
In conclusion, PET is a useful tool for the study of the mechanism and the kinetics of percutaneous intratumoral ethanol injection of HCC.	0.7005828073533924
During the last decade, many investigations were conducted in order to understand the mechanisms involved in the development of acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	0.6299060221124455
However, the increasing knowledge, instead of clarification, leads us to realize that these terms may assemble a wide variety of lung pathologies.	0.5752219760266661
Indeed, many circumstances can result in these syndromes and no particular factor has been defined to distinguish ARDS of one etiology from another.	0.5428902966835595
We are still ignorant about which factors lead to the extended inflammation from pneumonia to ARDS, while it is not clear whether the timing of events are determined by some mediators.	0.6092486654284882
Furthermore, in the clinical arena, there is no clear distinction between pneumonia, severe pneumonia which may lead to ALI and then ARDS.	0.7764292205735236
Finally, the results of all these studies should have allowed us to investigate new therapeutical approaches while none seems to emerge.	0.6086688765741174
This review is an analysis by an ICU clinician of the different points of view of these syndromes and intends to give a global vision of the numerous factors implied, emphasizing the complex interactions between them.	0.5979587479037232
The present state about new potential treatments directed on mediators is summarized.	0.3626975165780385
The aim of the study was to evaluate if a combined physiologic-therapeutic scoring system (MARIS = Marburger Intensive Score) offers better outcome prediction compared to scoring systems, which are based either only physiologically (APACHE II = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) or only therapeutically (TISS = Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System) in medical intensive care medicine.	0.6916569795842701
Main outcome parameters employed were hospital mortality, severity of disease classification and length of hospital stay.	0.49848754833373693
During a 12-months period (1993/94), 531 consecutive patients (ICU stay >4 hours) being admitted to a medical ICU of a tertiary care university hospital were prospectively investigated.	0.5886383426359942
The day-1-scores of MARIS, APACHE II, and TISS were determined and the patients were followed until hospital discharge or death.	0.7607622532006897
There was no advantage in using the combined scoring system (MARIS) neither in discrimination between survival and non-survival (hospital mortality; areas under the ROC-curve: MARIS = 0.84, APACHE II = 0.86, TISS = 0.78) nor in severity classification (relationship between day-1-scores and hospital mortality: p<0.001 (chi2-Test) in all three systems).	0.6251528308658243
In contrast only for the combined system (MARIS), a dependence of length of hospital stay from day-1-scores in the analysis of survivors only and in the analysis of all patients (survivors and non-survivors) (p<0.001; ANOVA) could be demonstrated.	0.7159230909054296
In conclusion the combined physiologic-therapeutic scoring system (MARIS) did not offer a better outcome prediction concerning hospital mortality and severity classification compared to the established systems in critically ill patients.	0.5338615094890664
Its use may be advantageous in evaluating the relationship between day-1-scores and length of hospital stay, which for economical reasons has become a parameter of growing interest in intensive care medicine.	0.656354463962202
A 23 month old boy was admitted to hospital because of anemia, mainly truncal rash and unclear pain.	0.4836867741655136
Previously he had shown fever, conjunctivitis and desquamations of hands and feet.	0.30844974516490037
Laboratory findings were moderate leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, anemia, and an elevation of ESR and gamma-globulins.	0.5968465257222484
No bacterial infection was found.	0.24395594697511305
The ECG showed signs of a myocardial ischemia.	0.6694045659018262
The sonography of the heart detected an aneurysm of the left coronary artery.	0.73819110851334
The boy died of a sudden cardiac arrest.	0.46733216744486117
The autopsy verified the diagnosis of Kawasaki-syndrome and revealed two coronary aneurysms blocked by thrombosis and a necrotic panarteriitis.	0.4616310865690162
The etiology of the painful hip in children is widespread.	0.5658602116172049
In this paper, predominants cases without previous trauma are discussed in detail.	0.5338270905255669
Depending on age, history, clinical picture and laboratory results, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is presented, which should avoid unnecessary tests and lead to the necessary therapeutic measure.	0.798189548335139
Several common as well as uncommon clinical entities are illustrated by representative examples.	0.38219411998744957
The present study exemplifies the method of quantitative reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) by quantifying, in bovine tissues, the specific mRNAs for the two key proteins which regulate cellular cholesterol metabolism, the low density lipoprotein (LDL) -receptor and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase.	0.7181495568340426
Our data reveal a broad range of expression for both mRNAs.	0.38561929261978595
The LDL-receptor mRNA expression was highest in the adrenal gland (6.7 x 104 molecules/ug cellular RNA) followed by the corpus luteum of the ovary, intermediate in the liver (8.6 x 102 molecules/ug cellular RNA) and not detectable in the large intestine.	0.6045742544987964
Expression of the HMG-CoA reductase almost paralleled LDL-receptor values.	0.41220487268859
It was found to be highest in the ovary (6.1 x 106 molecules/ug cellular RNA) followed by the adrenal gland, intermediate in the liver (3.1 x 105 molecules/ug cellular RNA) and lowest in the large intestine (9.9 x 104 molecules/ug cellular RNA).	0.6478345365829532
These data are consistent with other reports concerning the quantitative analysis of the expression of both proteins as determined by other experimental approaches.	0.5337044609631757
Thus cRT-PCR is a valuable tool for the quantitative analysis of the LDL-receptor and the HMG-CoA reductase.	0.5815935729303128
Spinal opioids are effective analgesics for surgical and non-surgical pain.	0.4002116824023246
Central and systemic side effects are less frequent than with epidural local anaesthetics or parenteral opioids.	0.5544780738987289
This review focuses on the analgesic efficacy of spinal opioids and their combination with local anaesthetics for postoperative analgesia, including patient-controlled epidural analgesia.	0.6462301376259484
Intrathecal administration of opioids has some advantages over their administration by the epidural route.	0.4320864420481404
Several factors may influence selection of the opioid; however, in most situations morphine is the drug of choice.	0.6107958738609787
Thoracic epidural administration of opioids seems to have no clinically important advantages over the lumbar route in terms of quality of analgesia, adverse effects, doses required or pulmonary function.	0.5597301295673818
However, evidence suggesting that effective postoperative analgesia can significantly improve postoperative morbidity in patients at risk is accumulating.	0.6138065455316977
In such patients, combined use of epidural local anaesthetics and opioids may become the technique of choice for postoperative analgesia.	0.759715277394914
However, there is no evidence that this would have any clinically relevant benefit in low-risk patients.	0.7671460022280502
This contribution summarizes a discussion of several experts on the field of clinical nutrition, which was held in Evangelische Akademie Loccum, Germany, May 20-21, 1998.	0.6060171409063325
Nutrition can be considered a medical treatment, which justifies assessment of benefits according to outcome parameters.	0.6412611266046145
With regard to nutritional support of the cancer patient, evaluation of quality of life (QL) is more appropriate than morbidity and survival related parameters.	0.646179908279048
Quality of life is a multidimensional construct which can be measured by standardized questionnaires.	0.6340812929159281
The QL Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), is an established and validated instrument which provides reliable information with regard to disease-related limitations of QL.	0.7343957101335419
The measurement of QL can be extended by appropriate modules for specific problems according to the underlying cancer disease and special therapies (e.g., percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy).	0.49375915202862525
In the individual case, the interpretation of the role of nutritional parameters for QL may be confounded by other parameters, such as disease or personal changes.	0.5861130881947076
However, the information supports decision making about the indication, the route of nutritional therapy, as well as individual follow-up.	0.651681623740709
Using QL as an outcome parameter, carefully designed prospective trials might be feasible in order to investigate the outcome of nutritional therapy in patients with advanced cancer.	0.6096516580737501
The inclusion of a control group is questionable from the ethical viewpoint.	0.4201058487719339
The treatment of distal fractures of the lower arm can be conservative or operative.	0.7422387000598165
The immediate aims of any treatment are anatomical realignment and the avoidance of trophic impairments, with the ultimate objective of unrestricted function of the hand and wrist.	0.6203279694289744
A graduated treatment scheme based on the ASIF classification is necessary to do justice to the different forms of fracture that can occur.	0.6183644832792318
The majority of injuries can still be successfully treated by conservative means; operative treatment becomes more important when there are signs of unusually high levels of instability or joint involvement.	0.5966771476907456
The authors' own patient population is presented in this paper: in these patients fixation with Kirschner wires has proved to be the most successful of the operative procedures used, followed by palmar plate fixation with or without cancellous bone plasty, and for C-type fractures according to the ASIF classification or when there is severe soft-tissue damage, application of a fixateur externe spanning the joint has proved best.	0.7224741511465272

Many couples have to cope with periods of involuntary childlessness and they often ask for medical help.	0.3666515861987065
In the Heidelberg Project of involuntary childlessness in men, andrological patients were surveyed from the time before diagnosis till the end of 1 year's andrological treatment.	0.49723182728017407
Cardiac complications remain an important cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality with noncardiac surgery, despite improvement in surgical techniques and anaesthetic management.	0.5679180483557846
Therefore preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment plays a pivotal role in management of patients prior to noncardiac surgery.	0.4289428136140609
Thorough history-taking and careful examination are essential to consider further diagnostic steps in order to predict the patient's individual perioperative cardiac risk as accurately as possible.	0.5926453744831032
Besides elaboration of medical therapy, cardiac catherization and even balloon angioplasty or bypass surgery must be considered if indicated by preoperative cardiac testing.	0.5693860816588416
According to the literature, chronic ankle instability occurs after acute rupture of the lateral ankle ligaments in 10-20 % of the cases.	0.7397375926438153
The etiology of the instability are ligamentous damage and functional neuromuscular disorder of the peroneal muscles.	0.5997075285250165
The standards of diagnostics are the history with the frequency of inversion trauma per period and the interval from the primary trauma, the clinical examination and radiological stress tests.	0.7443303156877961
Newer diagnostic methods, up to now not well established in clinical routine, include stabilometry, cybex-measurements of the pronator muscles, the evaluation of peroneal reaction time on a tilting platform and dynamic pedography.	0.587201036786608
Conservative management of chronic ankle instability consists of wearing ankle braces and rehabilitation programs concerned with peroneal muscle strengthening and coordination training.	0.38264997688225205
The indication for surgical reconstruction of the ankle ligaments are a well-documented mechanical instability with the neuromuscular reflexes intact and a failed physiotherapeutic training program.	0.6330432459422898
The surgical procedure should be selected according to a priority list: 1. anatomical repair, eventually augmented with periosteum from the fibula, 2.	0.6949648710448777

No other disease has exhibited such a significant influence on the behaviour of health care workers (HCW) as the AIDS pandemic.	0.6766494245116051
Numerous epidemiological data, however, have proven that the overall risk of transmission of the human deficiency virus (HIV) during surgical interventions is low; it is 0.3 % for all types of percutaneous exposures.	0.78017542412002
Nevertheless, there still is a need for wider adoption of safer surgical techniques to reduce the chances of HIV transmission in the operation theatre, which additionally minimize the risk of transmission of other blood-borne pathogens.	0.6936042540770876
In the case of occupational exposure to HIV-contaminated blood or body secretions post-exposure prophylaxis should be recommended stratified by the type of exposure and source material.	0.47037159047854
Abstract   Pachyonychia congenita (PC) comprises a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited conditions showing characteristic nail thickening and associated signs such as palmoplantar keratoderma, follicular keratoses, and mucosal leukokeratoses.	0.4242559002430447
Less frequently epidermal cysts, hairshaft abnormalities, natal teeth and laryngeal involvement may be seen.	0.38273568146270276
Phenotypically and genetically two major forms of PC are recognized, pachyonychia congenita Jadassohn- Lewandowsky/PC type I (Medelian inheritance in man - MIM - 167200) and pachyonychia congenita Jackson-Lawler/PC type II (MIM 167210).	0.4947180918716144
Both conditions show nail deformities, focal palmoplantar keratoderma, and follicular hyperkeratoses.	0.5228721122106487
Diagnostically relevant are leukokeratoses of the oral mucosa in patients with PC type I.	0.5587386901022869
In contrast individuals affected with PC type II show premature dentition and multiple pilosebaceous cysts predominantely affecting the upper trunk.	0.3636764820286755
The latter closely resemble eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex.	0.23367789970613032
By mutational analysis keratin K6a and K16 gene mutations have been detected in patients with PC type I, and keratin K6b and K17 gene mutations have been shown to be the underlying genetic defect in patients with PC type II.	0.572296623585627
We investigated the incidence of postoperative chest tube bleeding, administration of blood products, and changes in coagulation tests in patients with diltiazem (DIL) administration for reduction of myocardial ischemic episodes during elective CABG.	0.6272343191313415
We retrospectively analyzed the surgical and ICU records of CABG patients who had recieved DIL (27 pats.)	0.538791486096872
or nitroglycerin (NTG; 26 pats.)	0.2829340946815074
or a combination thereof (COM; 25 pats.).	0.3571660560979155
Data investigated included the amount of postoperative chest tube bleeding (CTB), frequency of administration of packed red blood cells (RBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and changes in hemoglobin (Hb), thrombocyte (Th) levels as well as changes in prothrombin- (PT) and partial thromboplastine time (PTT).	0.6021226829997111
There were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to biometrical or operative data.	0.5764116100401205
The amount of CTB as well as the use of RBC and FFP were not significantly different between the groups.	0.5256833885445538
Also, there were no significant differences with regard to Hb or Th and PT or PTT, both in the early phase after the operation in ICU as well as after 24 hours in the ICU.	0.7990819590038212
The perioperative administration of the calcium entery blocker DIL reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia during CABG surgery.	0.5406752033211243
This administration during CABG surgery does not increase the risk of postoperative bleeding.	0.45701549937280916
As compared to NTG, DIL does not have negative effects on Hb and Th levels or the commonly used coagulation parameters in the first 24 hours in the ICU after CABG surgery.	0.5674638989117057
Depression and fibromyalgia (FM) share common symptoms, indicating a close relationship between both disorders.	0.4538657491557651

At our hospital, closed dislocations of the elbow without neurovascular or osseous lesion are treated conservatively after successful reduction in the absence of a tendency to redislocation.	0.6870820495198814
Indications for surgery are irreducible dislocations and those with a tendency to redislocation as well as open soft tissue injuries, neurovascular and osseous concomitant injuries.	0.6125929436615641
During a period of 10 years 113 patients were treated according to this strategy.	0.6580144944812089
Of these patients, 46 had simple dislocations of the elbow and 67 suffered from dislocations with osseous lesions.	0.5823356130889012
In 95 patients follow-ups could be performed after a mean period of 55 months.	0.6609424857500525
In more than 75 % of cases good or excellent functional results were documented; unfavourable results were seen only in patients with osseous lesions.	0.736118395892782
Nearly all of the patients had a stable elbow joint at the end of therapy.	0.8696274629485348
The present study investigated the frequency and influencing factors of petechial bleeding (PET) in the conjunctivae and eyelids in different causes of death except strangulation.	0.6564976608127328
In a series of 473 autopsies the over all occurrence of PET was 13.3%.	0.44949608481786996
The highest frequencies were found in fire victims (31%), persons who had died after intensive care (24%), cardiac death (22%), drowning and intoxication (16% each).	0.6367709110826448
The frequency of PET decreased with increasing age and increased with the body mass.	0.6127843771557087
At first sight cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) seemed to influence the occurrence of PET, because the rate was 11% without and 19% with CPR (x2: p < 0.05); an aspect which has been mentioned in the literature.	0.5870783982123732
However, further analysis showed that a higher rate of PET could only be observed in causes of death where PET are often fround irrespective of CPR, whereas in the other groups PET (with or without CPR) are uncommon.	0.8208039016909958
Furthermore, a case-by-case analysis showed that in several cases with PET after CPR the causes could clearly be attributed to conditions other than CPR.	0.6676074263827728
In a second series of autopsy cases with only cardiac deaths (181 cases), the influence of age and body mass on the rate of PET was statistically significant and there was a tendency for more frequent PET with increasing heart weight.	0.6622356130952072
On the other hand, no statistically significant influence of CPR on the rate of PET could be found in this relatively homogeneous group.	0.6639617165476877
Media reports convey the impression that the incidence of fatal accidents in the European Alps has been increasing yearly at an alarming rate.	0.43017035323873226
Although objective data is lacking, the annual reports of the mountain rescue services in Germany, Austria, the southern Tirol, Switzerland and the Chamonix region in France were analysed with respect to the fatal and non-fatal accidents which occurred between 1987 and 1997.	0.5626887915467161
Because of varying definitions of "mountain accident" used in these countries, available data about the number of fatalities are not comparable.	0.5368674568163618
A 75-year-old man had painless, slowly enlarging tumors in the right and left infrascapular regions.	0.7034080910912073
Clinically, the tumors were nontender and semimobile.	0.5604232150371102
MR imaging and the operative exploration revealed tumors infiltrating the lateral thoracic muscles and periost of the scapula and underlying ribs.	0.4291630895218638
At surgery, the tumors were thought to be malignant, most likely liposarcomas.	0.7630395215436839
The histological examination showed the characteristic appearance of elastofibromas with spindle-shaped fibroblasts, which were separated by thick eosinophilic collagenous and elastic fibers.	0.5913321757061836
Elastofibromas are benign mesenchymal soft-tissue lesions that mainly affect elderly women.	0.34276517205857654
In 10 % of the patients bilateral, often asynchronous tumors are seen.	0.749353875890132
Ninety-nine percent of the lesions are located in the subscapular region.	0.5885321622109181
Occasional elastofibromas have been described in the extremities, head, and in the abdominal and thoracic cavities.	0.9849408577388081
The relative success of thrombolytic versus surgical therapy of thrombus in transit has not yet been evaluated in clinical studies.	0.5983865079447453
Only case reports of one or more patients exist.	0.6563207038330193
Optimal therapy, therefore, remains controversial, and conclusive recommendations in favor of one choice of therapy over the other cannot be given.	0.5497237872601707
Nevertheless, in current practice thrombolysis as a noninvasive and quickly available form of therapy is preferred, if no contraindications exist.	0.7381621487799177
Two cases are presented together with a literature review.	0.6638920480040701

Background: Recent studies have shown the usefulness of pars plana vitrectomy with the use of growth factors in the treatment of macular holes.	0.6352844556874241
Autologous platelet concentrates contain many growth factors to stimulate glial wound healing.	0.29396968916074884
In vitro fertilisation IVF and intrazytoplasmic sperm injection ICSI are the most commonly used methods of assisted reproduction.	0.5085128730886712
Whereas classic indications for both treatment options are widely accepted, for example severe tubal damage which cannot be microsurgically repaired, cryptozoospermia, severe OAT syndrome and repeated failure of fertilisation in normal IVF, ICSI might be indicated in a wider range of indications as well.	0.5275813853939607
In this paper a number of additional ICSI indications are defined, for example minor forms of andrological subfertility, reinsemination of nonfertilised oocytes on the day after conventional IVF, reduced motility of cryopreserved sperms, reduced quality of oocytes or ICSI after one cycle of unexplained fertilisation failure in IVF.	0.5583372688050182
Load on the human body can be influenced by shoes and surfaces which is important both in sports and rehabilitation.	0.6053527715540968
The loading which can primarily be influenced are impact situations and friction as well as the stability of the foot.	0.4357900103825492
This stability is of main interest in the prevention of pain and injury.	0.5452641354918598
However, a certain amount of loading is necessary to improve strength and structure of biological materials.	0.7216901391936219
In the past, the development of shoe and surface materials has hardly been perceived under this aspect, but may be increasingly important in the future.	0.672465521870169
With optimal clinical management of patients with Marfan syndrome, life expectancy may be improved substantially from 32 years to a nearly normal life span.	0.6025786296831391
Cornerstones of clinical management comprise genetic counseling, life-style management, and cardiovascular surveillance, which includes regular aortic imaging and endocarditis prophylaxis.	0.6195412559121486
Prophylactic use of beta-blocking agents as well as timing of elective surgery and the choice of the optimal surgical technique are difficult issues that obviously need to be individualized.	0.5598959231057381
Juvenile or postoperative patients as well as pregnant patients with Marfan syndrome pose particular problems.	0.3679726446752987
This review intends both to facilitate differential decision making based on referenced evidence and to provide guidelines for therapeutic strategies.	0.4263099602108309

In Germany, good clinical multicenter studies that are not supported by pharmaceutical companies are rarely performed.	0.5152301172139284
Good supranational industry-sponsored studies are usually aimed at the registration of new (expensive) drugs.	0.38333626351097166
The preconditions for co-operation in conducting industry-independent studies which are of interest for the scientific community have been improved substantially in Germany by instituting the working group of co-operating arthritis centers, the so-called core documentation where 32000 patients with rheumatic conditions were documented in 1997 and the institution of a sophisticated information system ("RheumaNet").	0.5827299397608228
The executive board of the German Rheumatology Association has set up an "ad hoc commission" that agreed to institute a "Committee for the Coordination of Clinical Studies in Rheumatic Diseases".	0.5459225932027693
In this committee rheumatologists subspecialized from medicine, orthopedic, pediatrics working in universities, hospitals and private practice as well as specialists in statistics and epidemiology shall be represented.	0.4726195889343625
In principle this committee is independent of the co-operating arthritis centers and the RheumaNet.	0.3966677573006423
All members of the German Rheumatology Association are invited to cooperate with this committee by contributing to the clinically important questions and participating in clinical studies.	0.5076527294161806
The committee has to define key questions in rheumatology and shall plan and organize multicenter studies to answer these questions.	0.3489780623433343
In addition, study protocols of pharmaceutical companies may be examined as to their importance, quality, and feasibility.	0.5487893581425601
Abnormal uterine bleeding is a gynecological problem frequently seen in women from adolescence to the postmenopausal period.	0.4375928735139421
Nearly 70% of patients' visits to the gynecologist in the peri- and postmenopausal period are due to abnormal uterine bleeding.	0.6812987039617993
According to the "speed"-hypothesis of cognitive development, the slowing of information processing in old age is at the core of negative age differences in psychometric intelligence.	0.6207580220645502
The present study investigates the "speed"-hypothesis for fluid intelligence at the individual level using Latent Growth Curve Methodology.	0.6432983138749025
Date on 4 measurement points come from the Bonn Longitudinal Study of aging (N=128, mean age 67.2, 53% women).	0.500250926746901
Based on principal factor analysis, markers of mental speed were the WAIS Digit Symbol Test and simple psychomotor task.	0.4047981739552746
As indicators of fluid intelligence the WAIS Object Assembly and Block Design were used.	0.3287247664272062
After separately fitting Latent Growth Curve Models for the trajectory of mental speed and fluid intelligence, a combined model showed no statistically significant improvement of fit for freeing the covariance between the two slope-factors.	0.547947173030626
Interpreting this result, contrary to the "speed"-hypothesis the intraindividual change of fluid intelligence does not relate to the according change of mental speed.	0.48865675681799114
For patients with dilative cardiomyopathy (DCM), the prognosis is highly unfavorable, even under conditions of optimal medication.	0.6985744860794267
At present, there is no option for causal therapy.	0.5527261555852115
Since there is increasing evidence that modifications of the immune system accompanied by the production of autoantibodies, e.g., against 1 ad-renergic or muscarinergic receptors, are involved in the pathogenesis of DCM, the elucidation of the possible functional significance of these autoantibodies has attracted increasing interest.	0.5845231545975214
In addition to the role of autoantibodies as markers for an autoimmune process, discussion of the possible pathogenetic mechanisms has centered on direct toxicity as well as on negative influencing of myocardial contractility and energy metabolism.	0.5877094092316911
The effects gained through removal of autoantibodies by immunoadsorption therapy for DCM patients sheds light on the functional importance of autoantibodies in this syndrome.	0.4160866734485164
The principle of this form of therapy is based on the binding of circulating antibodies to sepharose columns, to which polyclonal antibodies against human immunoglobulin are linked.	0.6198035143559643
A pilot study conducted among DCM patients disclosed that immunadsorption took place in simultaneous conjunction with a reduction in the immunoglobulin level and with significant hemodynamic and clinical improvement.	0.5308793221297723
These results may be interpreted as indicating that autoantibodies play an active role in DCM and that their removal by immunadsorption possibly represents a highly promising future therapeutic concept.	0.4311565360658758
Active unspecific immunotherapy in an adjuvant or palliative setting has been shown to enhance survival in melanoma patients, and gene therapy now offers new perspectives for active specific immunotherapy.	0.5140326679163268
Gene therapy includes the transfer of genetic material performed by either viral or non-viral methods and in vivo or ex vivo.	0.5249260139135012
For melanoma the following approaches are suggested: vaccination with tumour-specific, HLA-associated antigens using peptides or `naked DNA', vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with cytokine genes or B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T-lymphocytes or transfected tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of tumour cells with a tumour suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a crucial role in melanoma.	0.4644856607999303
Since 1995, a total of 115 patients with pseudarthrosis or delayed bone fracture healing have each undergone a single session of shock wave treatment.	0.471991424782284
After the treatment the fractures were correctly set according to the rules of conservative bone fracture treatment.	0.6295804469649162
The mean follow-up period for all patients was 31 months (range 3-50 months.	0.7904253958301327
In 87 cases (75.7%) bony consolidation was achieved with simultaneous reduction in the symptoms.	0.6450061434671908
Apart from low-grade local reactions (swelling, haematoma, petechiae) no complications were observed.	0.538045355733971
The treatment is noninvasive and requires little investment in terms of personnel or technology.	0.45107649561710195
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy should therefore be considered before an elaborate operative procedure is initiated in the treatment of pseudarthrosis and of delayed fracture healing.	0.5420681685180416
The sound transmission properties of three different commercially available middle ear implants and the prototype of a complete middle ear prosthesis (CoMEP) were evaluated with a special measurement system that permits standardized conditions.	0.6720614195480166
This system uses a mechanical middle ear model (MMM) which approximates the impedances of the tympanic membrane and inner ear.	0.48360467668209467
The implants were fitted under defined conditions into the MMM.	0.4010700559302578
Displacement of the artificial stapes footplate of the MMM was measured with an optical probe.	0.5814601476351254
The measurements of different middle ear prostheses showed that the mass of the implant was the most important factor for optimum high frequency transmission.	0.753958602243853
The lightest implant (4 mg, titanium) showed the best results.	0.8300712607214257
The CoMEP revealed the highest sensitivity because of a slight enlargement of the diameter of the artificial tympanic membrane.	0.6067963176703028
These findings show that the CoMEP is able to restore sound transmission to a normal range.	0.5607089253751897
In a second experiment one of the implants was fitted into the MMM with different forces.	0.7054443874610945
The increase of stiffness produced a slightly better high frequency transmission at the expense of low frequency sensitivity.	0.50833269755405
Hence, the fitting of the implant may not be too stiff because of its loss of mobility within a significant frequency range.	0.6373587107885615
Angiomyolipomas are hamartomas that may be found sporadically or associated with tuberous sclerosis (M. Bourneville-Pringle).	0.4928155500773927
Clinically, this long-term asymptomatic tumor becomes evident as an acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage or by symptoms of a flank mass.	0.643383675409145
Due to the high percentage of fat components in this tumor type, computed tomography is far superior to other radiological procedures.	0.6148732098717243
In view of two of our own case reports, the therapeutic strategies are discussed, paying regard to the actual literature in this field.	0.8925254071613021
The excact pathogenesis of Peyronie's Disease (PD) is still unknown.	0.5608027566063872
Histopathological investigations suggest, that the metabolism of the collogenious tissue plays an important role.	0.6174330367822776
Therefore, we started a prospective study in order to evaluate the metabolic situation of 11 patients with PD and 11 healthy controls.	0.7988756856638353
We mesured biochemical parameters of penile and venous blood, wich correspond to the collagen metabolism (procollagen III [P III P], PMN-elastase [PMN-E], fibronectin [FN], fibronectinreceptor [FN-R] und -1-proteinase-inhibitor [-1-PI]).	0.5466433364390805
There was no difference in PMN-E, P III P, FN and FN-R in all samples.	0.6055296655133732
There was no difference in penile and venous blood as well.	0.534629940827117
But we found out a highly significant lower concentration of -1-PI in patients with PD (158,55 mg/dl) than in controls (214,82 mg/dl).	0.7070680538249743
Closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon is rare.	0.6134744264540414
Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature, perhaps because the symptoms are often neglected by the patient as well as by the doctor.	0.7562310376467158
Most often the rupture occurs as a consequence of a sudden plantar flexion of the ankle and pre-existing degenerative changes of the tendon tissue due to systemic disease or iatrogenic local corticoid injections.	0.6914122184893841
Clinically, the tendon rupture presents as acute weakness of the ankle extensors without reddening, swelling or neurological signs.	0.5743913334210768
Differential diagnoses such as anterior tibial syndrome and peroneal nerve palsy can thus be excluded.	0.45125066200689457
During the clinical examination the distal stump and the discontinuity of the anterior tibial tendon are often palpable.	0.6624991908733687
The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by an ultrasound examination.	0.6340811636799163
An operation may be undertaken up to 3 months after the injury.	0.6222593720457397
Preferred procedures are end-to-end anastomosis and transosseous refixation of the tendon, followed by a plaster cast for 6 weeks postoperatively.	0.6284970388354572
High-risk patients can be treated conservatively, but the functional results are less satisfactory.	1.0473382267083238
We describe a case of an acute closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon.	0.8981777240556575
A yet unpublished method of osseous reinsertion of the tendon is presented.	0.517022043029666
In this four-part review article, an update of Psychological Gerontology since 1988 in German speaking countries is given.	0.46826770947785684
Part II of this review focuses an personality development in old age.	0.5985634500565218
In accordance with their current relevance within research on personality development, concepts and empirical studies concerned with coping, psychological resilience and development regulation in old age are addressed in the first part of this review (contributions to basic research).	0.6104888573578172
First, research based on the two-process-model of coping, the personality theory of Thomae and the life-span theory of control is summarized.	0.643828258838049
Next, work on subjective well-being, self and self-regulation are highlighted.	0.5809119783623937
In the second part of the review (contribution to applied research), an overview of the scope of potential of psychotherapeutic intervention in old age is given.	0.7071091696479703
Background: According to literature, 30-60 % of pacemaker patients suffer from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).	0.6754330368229534
As rapid tracking of PAF may cause severe symptoms in patients with dual chamber pacemakers, refined algorithms providing AV synchronous pacing during periods of sinus rhythm and preventing high ventricular rates during PAF are highly desirable.	0.4624519043546796
Aim and method: This comprehensive paper introduces a new mode switching (MS) algorithm which uses either a fixed (Inos2CLS) or programmable (Logos) number of short intervals out of 8 consecutive atrial intervals to detect PAF.	0.4710913606645842
If the MS criterion is fulfilled, a switch from AV synchronous pacing to nontracking mode is automatically performed.	0.46776136655358075
The algorithm is described together with a discussion on optimization of the programming of parameters which may indirectly influence the MS sensitivity and specificity.	0.526952426940654
Results: This MS concept maintains the high sensitivity and fast reactivity towards PAF of the "mode conversion" in Actros and Kairos pacemaker systems, preventing a long time delay between onset of PAF, detection of the arrhythmia, and switch to nontracking mode.	0.636641578341704
In addition, adequeate sensing and short blanking periods in the new MS concept enable reliable MS.	0.33932131911818797
The occurrence of atrial oversensing should be tested, as it may lead to inappropriate MS. Programmability of the MS algorithm may be advantageous for individual programming with respect to the patients' arrhythmia rate and atrial sensing performance, but the use of very restrictive or very liberal criteria should be avoided as both may lead to mode oscillations.	0.6753872865014175
Finally, examples of stored diagnostic data are presented to assess MS reliability, identify possible problems, and optimize MS function during follow-up.	0.5301211023412156
Purpose: To evaluate MR imaging at 1.5 Tesla in patients suffering from acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) using proton-density weighted (PDW) fast spin echo (FSE) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences.	0.5769742665945218
A number of infectious agents has been newly detected in the last 10 years.	0.6899845798964115
Climatic hanges and migration have been the most important factors in the emergence of new and old infections.	0.5998974980083732
Additionally, new methods for the detection of DNA and RNA have played an important role in the detection of agents difficult to culture.	0.5949129931903386

Introduction: Coronary arterty disease still remains the primary cause of death in the western industrialized world.	0.596119267409724
Although the clinical value of selective coronary angiography (SCA) is beyond dispute, the associated risk of an invasive approach, the inherent costs and the necessary hospitalization have lead to the development and investigation of novel non-invasive techniques for coronary imaging.	0.7270756920945981
Intravenous coronary angiography (ICA) has been shown to permit non-invasive imaging of the coronary arteries.	0.6517209515921732
We report nine case histories of patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital for severe somatic disorders.	0.4912274425100685
The somatic disease was either the cause of the psychiatric symptomatology, or it occurred in addition to a well-known psychiatric disorder.	0.7435884559280712
For general practitioners and psychiatrists it can be difficult to differentiate between symptoms due to psychiatric disorders and symptoms that indicate somatic disorders.	0.5459789008932997
If patients refuse the necessary diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and show behaviour that is not related to good health, there is increased risk for complications and increased morbidity.	0.6590986785416884
Penetrating neck injuries are potentially life-threatening injuries.	0.4571004089129403

An algorithm for diagnosis and therapy is needed because of the potential risk of mortality.	0.7325544043168002
In the Department of Trauma Surgery of Vienna Medical School, mandatory surgical exploration after noninvasive investigations is practiced.	0.4287760838421463
Thirty-one patients with this kind of injury were treated between August 1992 and September 1999.	0.6098785027915504
Injuries were caused in seven cases by gunshots, in eight cases by broken glass, in one case by an iron rod, in one case by a spear, in one case by a branch and in 13 cases the penetrating injuries were stab wounds caused by knives.	0.7446331379045236

No patient came to death.	0.2593743527600639
During a 18-year-period 93 patients (f=76, m=17) with a factitious disorder were identified in the psychiatric consultation service of a university hospital (incidence: 0.62%).	0.6835551929314295
50% of women were working in medical professions whereas only 6% of men.	0.7563932637754183
Chronic courses of illness were prevailing, but at least one quarter of female patients showed an intermittent type.	0.7984962051928813
There was a classical Munchhausen syndrome in 11% of patients.	0.7021639979211917
Depressive and anxiety disorders (10%, 4%) were to be respected as psychiatric comorbidity.	0.8296507036251083
Ca 25% of the patients suffered from a somatic illness in addition to the factitious disorder, and one third of the women had symptoms of psychosomatic, especially of eating disorders.	0.8951847105429851
Previous somatoform disorders, deliberate self harm and attempts of suicide were to be noted in the psychiatric history of many patients.	0.5235080506798678
There were frequent traumatizing events (foster home, disturbing family disharmony, physical and sexual abuse, early losses, serious illnesses) in the early biography.	0.6462096926957875
Various psychosocial stressors could be identified in the actual eliciting situation.	0.5860581066132091
The results are discussed in respect of epidemiology, development and clinical phenomenology of factitious disorders, psychodynamics and psychopathology of deception and self harm, and therapeutic options in the psychiatric consultation service.	0.6668935092772068
In a long-term follow-up we evaluated 40 patients out of 55 (73 %) with a subtalar fusion.	0.6954062364721334
The operations took place from 5/84 to 5/91.	0.35830312497824757
In all cases the indication for the fusion was a post-traumatic arthritis after an intra-articular os calcis fracture.	0.7535236166295434
The evaluation of the overall results was carried out with three different scoring systems: a.	0.773655280789128
The Outcome-questionnaire, rating patient's complaints and the functional status based on the severity-symptom scale and functional status described for Carpaltunnel-syndrome by Levine et al.	0.5447094060988728
c. The clinical rating system (CRS) described by Kitaoka et al.	0.703553762000583
The statistical evaluation was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA).	0.5032332592620183
Level of significance was based on P = 0.05 and calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficient.	0.5494303074763028
The Os calcis fracture was the cause for the subtalar arthritis in all 40 patients (33 males and 7 females).	0.6248567659021206
The primary treatment of the calcaneal fracture was conservative (cons.)	0.48207759938266725
using a plaster in 23 patients (57.5 %), while 17 patients (42.5 %) underwent open reduction and plate fixation (op.).	0.6986068668423469
The interval between trauma and subtalar fusion averaged 3.5 years (3 months to 20 years).	0.7968258947460952
The interval between subtalar fusion and follow-up averaged 5.2 years (4-14 years).	0.7203772276470678
The mean age at the time of reexamination was 47 years (26-61 years).	0.612959531559068
In the present study, complete pain relief could be achieved in 21 (52.5 %; 58 % op., 50 % cons.)	0.6965848299808454
A relevant restriction in the range of motion in the ankle joint was found in 26 (65 %; 76 % op., 58 % cons.).	0.722519381267083
In 23 patients (62 %; 65 % op., 59 % cons.)	0.5767571001378972
the radiological evaluation revealed a grade 1  Â° arthritis of the ankle joint, in the talonavicular joint in 17 patients (42.5 %; 41 % op., 45 % cons.	0.7047299845415846
), and in the calcaneo-cuboid joint in 14 patients (35 %; 47 %., 27 % cons.).	0.8626793142956972
The statistical analysis revealed a better outcome in the operative group compared with the conservative group, although the operated os calcis fractures in the majority were the more severe fracture types.	0.9156332801123481
In all evaluation systems a score between 61 and 69 points could be achieved with no significant difference between the operatively and conservatively treated groups and between the newly developed questionaire and the clinical-radiological scoring systems.	0.6128587725318645
For the questionaire this fulfills the requirements for a reliable outcome evaluation.	0.3821259612994765
Objectives Correction of an overriding fifth toe.	0.3346058972438873
Non-palpable breast-lesions like microcalcifications often fail an exact diagnosis.	0.4055568309558431
Accurate treatment is difficult by conventional marking and operating procedures since freehand positionin of al localization wire is often suboptimal.	0.3572831381516901
The consequences are larger tissue-defects leading to an insufficient cosmetic result.	0.4092022712737632
Nevertheless, resection of microcalcifications by conventional surgery remains sometimes incomplete.	0.46444385379657
Digital mammography coupled with stereotactic biopsy procedures gives more accurate results with minimal invasive techniques.	0.35301497600884985
The advantages and disadvantages of the advanced breast biopsy intstrumentation (ABBI) procedure versus vacuum biopsy systems are summarized and compared.	0.40107899427087085
Either of those systems is highly accepted by the patients due to the outpatient manner of its application and the convincing results regarding sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the methods.	0.7032428210976883
Chondroid syringoma belongs to the group of so-called mixed tumors, like pleomorphic adenomas of the lacrimal and salivary glands.	0.5757959461017
The histogenesis of this tumour is still disputed, in particular with respect to its stromal component.	0.7667619522355348
The distribution of cytokeratins (CKs), CEA, EMA, vimentin, S-100 protein, desmin and actin [-smooth muscle actin (-SMA)] was investigated by immunohistological examination of paraffin sections from a chondroid syringoma of the apocrine type.	0.5932449560602095
The neoplastic formations have been classified into tubuloalveolar structures, solid nests/aggregations and stromal cells of varying morphology.	0.39527597654782826
The innermost cells of tubuloalveolar structures were characterized by marked expression of CKs (KL1 and MNF116), CEA and EMA, while in the outer ones there was moderate expression of vimentin, S-100 was expressed to a lesser extent and KL1, weakly but there was marked and consistent expression of MNF116.	0.5044574179150396
Whereas the solid nests expressed vimentin, S-100 protein, MNF116 markedly and KL1 weakly, the stromal cells were consistently positive for vimentin, S-100 protein and, focally, CKs and -SMA.	0.5576414106180114
Anti--SMA specifically detects myoepithelial cells.	0.20643416211617563
In addition, the partly overlapping immunoreactivity of the intermediate filaments, membrane proteins and proteins in the different structures may indicate a common clonal origin of all neoplastic cells in chondroid syringoma.	0.4679977104461238
Leg ulcers may be caused by many different diseases.	0.35840856210221583
Most frequently, they are due to vasculopathies, to a lesser extent to metabolic, neuropathic or hematologic diseases.	0.6162574150510604
Neoplasms, connective tissue diseases, infections, trauma, and panniculitis should also be included in the differential diagnosis.	0.5540715163724489
A 38-year-old Caucasian female patient with hereditary prolidase deficiency developed progressive and very painful leg ulcers.	0.4900317674345394
The ulcers first appeared in childhood and did not respond to various treatments.	0.5290991548946147
Additional features of prolidase deficiency included mental retardation, short stature, extensive dental caries, and multiple malar teleangiectases.	0.514223671125054
Hereditary prolidase deficiency is a very rare autosomal recessive disease.	0.5348083097441783
It is caused by heterogeneous mutations of the prolidase gene and affects many aspects of protein metabolism.	0.38647328980949575
Ion exchange chromatography and high voltage electrophoresis of urine can prove the suspected diagnosis.	0.29232197366049484
So far, there is no efficient therapy for hereditary prolidase deficiency.	0.5227979721056905

In this paper the basic features of acute, subacute and chronic types of osteomyelitis, skeletal tuberculosis and some special forms of osteomyelitis are described.	0.6381668464966421
The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is established using clinical signs and symptoms, culture studies, laboratory studies and radiological signs.	0.6342154225528609
The common conservative and surgical treatments are discussed.	0.4243412320700495
In the treatment of post-traumatic/postoperative osteitis severe problems are encountered as a result of an increasing number of orthopaedic traumatologic surgical techniques using a variety of implants and because of a generally increasing occurrence of multiresistant strains.	0.5644222316352385
Thanks to modern treatment and the increased use of antibiotics, a considerable decrease in morbidity and mortality is observed.	0.7346947156059648
Despite this improved prognosis, an established infection remains one of the most challenging problems for the orthopaedic surgeon.	0.675101748983921
Besides an exponential growth in possibilities for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention in reproductive medicine and genetics, the synergistic effects of modern health technologies have led to the necessity of fast transfer of knowledge into the public domain in order to develop a common social consensus.	0.635884559405215
Thus, physicians and scientists have enormous obligations not only for the development of medical technology but also of medical and societal ethics.	0.5681540195478726
Very early, i. e. in 1984, the German Medical Association developed professional laws for reproductive medicine.	0.6887245798294113
In addition, the German government saw the need in 1990 for an "Embryo Protection Law" (Embryonenschutzgesetz).	0.5999771100089425
Today, in the light of European integration, the medical profession's and state's obligations are challenged in different ways.	0.6488278487223758
Whereas the German Medical Association continuously works on professional guidelines for reproductive medicine and genetics - currently the case with preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the government must develop the sociolegal framework for ethically sound reproductive medicine, i. e. , in the areas of inheritance law, adoption law, family law, and law of succession, the latter especially in the case of discrepancies between genetic vs. social paternity in heterologous insemination.	0.6595817663748591
In Crohn's disease, some concomitant neurological illnesses such as cerebral ischemia following arterial or venous thrombosis, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord following malabsorption of vitamin B12 or folic acid, opticus neuropathy, and polyneuropathy have been described.	0.570871953698832
Cerebral vasculitis secondary to Crohn's disease seems to be a very rare phenomenon.	0.8053329030947197
We report on three such cases in three female patients (aged 26, 29, and 61 years).	0.807639087824869
All patients became symptomatic with a hemiparesis; one complained additionally of a speech disorder, headache, and intermittent loss of orientation.	0.5142817715475771
In CT and MRI scans, multiple lesions were detected; cerebral angiography showed multiple stenoses of middle- and large-sized vessels that were compatible with cerebral vasculitis.	0.6021156091492057
Serologic tests concerning vasculitis were inconspicuous at that time.	0.23552811003992039
Under anticoagulation (in two cases) and immunosuppressive therapy, neurologic symptoms disappeared.	0.7486563801412641
In the following 6 to 12 months, no new neurological symptoms appeared.	0.7941010662135884
In two cases, Doppler sonographic controls showed stationary and, in one case, progressive intracranial stenoses.	0.7023323795390973
The serin protease tryptase (ECNr.	0.21908524001504703
3.4.21.59), which is almost exclusively expressed in mast cells, is released by mast cell degranulation in an enzymatically active form together with other mediators, e.g.	0.6223500146260049
histamine, into the extracellular space and the circulation.	0.43130907408508107
The capability of the enzyme to directly stimulate several cell types as well as to cleave polypeptide hormones and to activate pro-enzymes suggests a role for tryptase in inflammatory and tissue-remodeling processes.	0.48499316246324176
Therefore, in the skin, a role of tryptase is suggested not only in mastocytosis and immediate type hypersensitivity reactions, but also in other inflammatory diseases, degenerative or neoplastic conditions as well as in wound healing, where an accumulation and/or activation of mast cells is found.	0.7774581452254812
Extracellular tryptase may be superior to histamine as a parameter for the onset and course of immediate type reactions and as an indicator for the activation of mast cells in other conditions.	0.5705181002331704
Its absence during histamine-liberating reactions may suggest basophil activation.	0.20077699404466076
In addition, tryptase has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for the localization of mast cells in tissues.	0.7562937624747241
Background: Since the development of lacrimal endoscopes with which the mucosa and disorders of the lacrimal drainage system can be examined directly, the choice of surgical technique has changed decisively.	0.7015021188974747
Flexible miniendoscopes can be combined with a laser for the first time, allowing for exact localization of the stenosis and subsequent therapy.	0.6793949763599315
Surgery of tibial plateau fractures with joint involvement (AO classification 41 A1, B1-B3 and C1- C3) makes high demands on traumatological management.	0.4250581298670732
By using modern, minimally invasive operative techniques for juxta-articular fractures, it is possible to prevent soft tissue injuries that might affect the functional result.	0.6639267200673805
The aim of this technique is to achieve the exercise stability obtained with standard procedures.	0.7817313665159412
Arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis not only minimizes the surgical soft tissue trauma, but also enables a precise assessment of the articular surfaces under the operation, as well as the simultaneous treatment of concomitant intra-articular injuries, a particular advantage as compared to conventional operative methods.	0.7234048144264155
From a total of 54 patients with tibial plateau fractures, arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis was performed in 34 patients at our clinic from September 1994 to January 1998.	0.6326279720338015
The follow-up of a total of 17 patients revealed good recoveries when assayed by means of the Lysholm and Delamarter score.	0.6002209339914407
We suggest that arthroscopically assisted, minimally invasive osteosynthesis can also be used in selected patients for the treatment of AO classification 41 C1-C3 fractures.	0.6230934030841391
Dorsal tension band fixation is a wide-spread technique of finger arthrodesis.	0.5018792194713696
When using a resorbable PDS-suture as tension band fixation a costly implant removal is not needed.	0.4184188073755445
Aim of this study is the investigation of the primary stability of this technique in combination with the cup-in-cone-procedure.	0.8915033596491365
Freeze-preserved fingers with thread tension band fixation using the PDS-material (series 1), the same fixating method on formaldehyde preserved fingers (series 3), freeze-preserved fingers with a standard tension band fixating (wire loop, series 2) are load in a four-point-bending in the direction of palmarflexion.	0.5745390267909384
From 6 degrees onwards the wire-tension-system requires a higher torque for bending, but in case of higher torque frequently leads to fracture.	0.544319325971797
The examination shows that the thread-tension-band method by PDS-loop for the stabilisation of finger joint arthrodesis has a sufficient initial stability against bending forces.	0.42594937526065074
Modern medicine has succeeded in achieving enormous technical developments.	0.22692294334274554
One recent highlight has been the introduction of postmortem organ transplantation.	0.40427596253997083
At the same time, serious objections have been raised concerning the radical changes in the cultural conception of the inviolable body.	0.5098376430740107
One major objection arises from the conflict of considering a brain-dead person as dead.	0.38896554903072306
The presence of brain death is a prerequisite for post-mortem organ donation, because only during this phase of dying does the individual quality as dead while the organs, other than the brain, remain viable.	0.6270416976314587
The objection implies scepticism as to the physician's ability to distinguish a dead from a living person.	0.5198833785538357
On the other hand, even the critics must rely on the physician's ability to discriminate, e.g., when to discontinue resuscitation.	0.5901408528507344
The medical community has not found reasons to restrict the definition of irreversible coma 25 years after its first formulation.	0.4936939818661831
It must be clearly recognised that reasons other than medical ones can be decisive for refusing organ donation.	0.33915929567755
One ethical problem is the therapeutic benefit of organ transplantation.	0.41916819279382767
The beneficiary of the treatment is not the donor, but another person, the recipient.	0.9392186636207962
The concept of human dignity does not allow the use of a person fur purposes other than the ones he/she consents to, as Immanuel Kant stated.	0.6000605160870045
Although the human corpse is not a person in the full sense, even if it is protected by the thought of respect for the former person, the life-interest of the organ recipient had to be considered legitimate.	0.744234769509244
The resulting conflict between the respect for the donor and the life-interest of the recipient should be balanced by seeking the donor's consent as far as possible.	0.46464864712742204
The proposed information model seems adequate at the moment.	0.3858473898768261
A common report of both churches in Germany in 1990 supported postmortem organ transplantation.	0.4249240829803595
The report dealt with the medical problems and harmonized them with the Christian value of solidarity.	0.4788431197407621
The ethical alternatives to organ transplantation, however, are not mentioned.	0.5964548567100036
Within this limitation, the report seems to adequately express the aim to strengthen individual competence and plead for fair perception of the neighbour's life-interest.	0.5002841666360166
Starting point for this analysis are the mobility needs and requirements of elderly, as well as problems concerning access and use of public transport.	0.49188453569331864
Elderly people as car drivers suffer from several performance deficits which are currently compensated by mobility restrictions and changed driving behaviour.	0.3720542393851236
Driver assistance systems, just available or soon on the market, are demonstrated and analysed with respect to their impact on elderly drivers.	0.5449150225109212
An expert evaluation comes to the conclusion that the most important systems for elderly are: emergency systems, enhanced vision systems and parking aids.	0.5815617570666701
Emergency systems can call rescue teams automatically or at driver's request, and direct them to the emergency location.	0.5363876863929017
Self imposed restrictions of elderly concerning night driving can partly be compensated by means of curve lightning and automatic dipping.	0.3156037443854934
Parking aids, using cameras or infrared technique are especially helpful for persons with movability problems.	0.4476480893400392
The group of helpful, but not highly important driver assistance systems covers several means for longitudinal and lateral control of the car, comprising autonomous cruise control, antilock systems and electronic stability programmes.	0.6062703963529955
The value and impact of these systems are analysed in the light of risk homeostasis theory.	0.5532309937786261
Reduced work load and ease of mobility will at last result from user centered navigation systems, helping the elder driver also to move to new areas without orientational problems.	0.3474572721861245
The article demonstrates the particular importance of specific layouts of the man-machine-interface for elderly, to guarantee high acceptance and minimal distraction from traffic.	0.5031974464291857
Causal treatment regimens of proven effectiveness in controlled studies are only available for cases of male infertility resulting from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.	0.48208342330146275
Drug treatment of retrograde ejaculation is also effective but has so far not been tested in double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized studies.	0.5183900886913503
The results of immunosuppressive therapy in cases of immunological male infertility are still controversial .	0.5972987764932935
In addition, antiphlogistic and antibiotic treatment of chronic male genital tract infections has not been shown to improve male fertility.	0.6456253893123871
Inconsistent results have been obtained with empirical therapy - e.g., with kallikein, tamoxifen, clomiphene, pentoxifylline, mast cell blockers, testolacton, vitamin E, captopril, alpha receptor blockers, glutathione, indometacin, interferon alpha, growth hormone, zinc salts, ketoprofen, mesterone or testosterone undecanoate - or the studies performed are not sufficient to allow a final judgement.	0.5949089991891275
Recent studies have indicated a possible impairment of sperm function by pure FSH, while GnrH and FSH have no influence on spermatogenesis in normogonadotropic men.	0.5062651042574933
In 40 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), in 5 patients with non-AD dementia and in 36 cognitively normal controls the concentration of protein tau was determined in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).	0.5952037091213275
Of the AD patients, 19 were very mildly demented (MMSE score from 25 to 28).	0.4676749557825828
Even in these patients, CSF tau was significantly more elevated than in controls.	0.4759891350392568
In the non-AD patients protein tau was less increased.	0.39358035097611516
Among the AD patients there was no association between CSF tau and severity of cognitive impairment or deficit in cerebral blood flow, determined by SPECT.	0.5319831318382556
Our findings suggest that CSF tau may be elevated even at the predementia stage of AD and be useful as a biological marker for the early recognition of the disease.	0.540116757272768
The aim of our review is to summarize relevant data on the perioperative use of anti-ischaemic drugs in patients at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease.	0.6995980427635006
The accessible medical literature according to current electronic information sources was explored.	0.2910073206338104
One in every eight general anaesthetics is administered to a patient at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease.	0.42651504363366977
Of these patients, it is estimated that 20% - 40% have perioperative myocardial ischaemia (PMI), the majority being nonsymptomatic.	0.8417522221259007
This figure correlates with the occurrence of postoperative cardiac complications and myocardial infarction.	0.43544190703776364
The anaesthetist therefore has an important role to play in reducing the rate of perioperative cardiac sequelae.	0.5600222205713016
This can be achieved with good control of haemodynamic stability and the timely and appropriate use of antiischaemic drugs.	0.5614762173269748
Nitrocompounds (nitrates, molsidomine) serve as the gold standard in current angina pectoris treatment.	0.4445548497147622
Acting as coronary and systemic vasodilators, they effect an immediate reduction in preload and have been shown to be the drugs of first choice for intraoperative myocardial ischaemia.	0.6853801300958675
Beta-blockers reduce the rate of PMI to a greater extent than nitrates.	0.48764247884961065
They are also effective in myocardial ischaemia not accompanied by an increased heart rate.	0.6579214285853328
Single pre-operative administration of beta-blockers has also been shown to be beneficial in reducing theincidence of perioperative tachycardia, hypertension, and PMI.	0.6156666315553511
Consequently, such one-time medication can be considered for previously untreated high-risk patients presenting for surgery.	0.811390005292802
The continuation of oral calcium channel blockers to the morning of surgery also reduces the rate of PMI and myocardial infarction in coronary-bypass patients, and combination with beta-blockers enhances this effect.	0.5876211314291053
Intra-operative diltiazem infusions are similarly advantageous in this patient group.	0.41361812516207724
In addition to nitrates, calcium antagonists are the drug of choice for coronary vasospasm.	0.6394327789956394
Drugs inhibiting platelet aggregation have a particular role in patients with coronary heart disease, however, they also cause increased perioperative bleeding.	0.5348215049011942
Consequently, it is recommended that these medications be discontinued 5 - 10 days prior to major surgery, with the exception of high-risk patients.	0.8081522988295996
Pilot studies using alpha2-agonists have shown reduced anaesthetic requirements and a reduction in PMI.	0.41016668198816514
The perioperative relevance of these drugs is currently being investigated.	0.6511849110285372
Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and possibly alpha2-agonists lead to reduced rates of PMI and other cardiac complications in risk patients.	0.6146072535916027
Current anti-anginal medications, with the exception of anti-platelet agents, should be maintained to the day of surgery and continued as soon as possible thereafter.	0.653834951592239
All of these drugs except anti-platelet agents may also be used intra-operatively, however, possible interactions with anaesthetic agents should be carefully considered.	0.6547204986686295
Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) were thought to be psychosomatic disorders.	0.4981179481974475
However, this argument has recently been questioned by many researchers.	0.5905681241454821
At the same time, biomedical factors have been described that were claimed to play a role in the aetiology and modulation of the course of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).	0.6605736789484224
In the present paper, the state of research regarding both biomedical and psychosomatic factors of the aetiology and course of IBD is reviewed and critically evaluated from a methodological perspective.	0.7400584635900006
Results covering the following topics are presented: epidemiology; sociodemographic variables; genetic factors; dietary factors and cigarette smoking; drugs; permeability of bowel epithelia; immunological factors; microbiological factors; psychiatric disorders, affective symptoms, personality factors; life events and psychosocial stress; quality of life; and coping with the illness.	0.506777450941353
Among biomedical factors, a genetically based pathological immune reaction is highly probable.	0.51552441987021
However, the findings of immunological disturbances are of a more descriptive nature and seem to explain not the aetiological process of the development of the disease, but rather a kind of disposition.	0.8058585852214608
The question of which agents trigger the pathological immune cascade is still under investigation.	0.5311077330919489
Interesting findings can possibly be expected of the psycho-neuro-immunological research in this area.	0.39931213469724125
Results of research on psychological pathology (psychiatric disorders, personality factors) are inconclusive.	0.5465855362316947
In particular, some modern, well-controlled studies have not been able to confirm the findings of the older literature.	0.7410880960843723
Part of the high rate of psychiatric morbidity might be due to effects of selective sampling of more disturbed subjects.	0.5706297258305605
Research pertaining to the influence of distressing life events has also yielded inconsistent results.	0.36074156414290665
Prospective studies about the association of psychosocial stress and somatic symptomatology mostly demonstrated cross-sectional correlations which did not allow for causal interpretations.	0.4721583358375079
However, coping research has shown interesting results that point to the mediating influence of coping strategies on the course of the disease.	0.47449621280186394
Finally, perspectives for future research are suggested.	0.4577746405053055
Genital infection, particularly bacterial vaginosis (BV), increases the relative risk of prematurity.	0.5542697156389312
Detection of disturbances of vaginal milieu at an early stage and the use of suitable countermeasures such as intervention with antimicrobial substances can reduce the preterm birth rate.	0.456446921352105
A pregnancy with a partial or complete hydatidiform mole and a coexistent living fetus is a rare condition.	0.6283104513329395
Most cases are consistent with a twin pregnancy, with distinct borders between placenta and mole on sonography.	0.5482408706066378
We report a case with a single placenta with cystic structures resembling histologically a complete hydatidiform mole.	0.7014137966796324
The pregnancy resulted in a diploid female fetus in the 34th week of gestation with marked hypotrophy.	0.4056032757794017
The non-molar part of the placenta showed a complex alteration of villous maturity resulting in intrauterine growth retardation but a living fetus.	0.4287322882690215
No malignancy occured post partum.	0.1409160758873087
The clinical and pathogenetic aspects of this rare entity are discussed.	0.8338160699025363
So far, necrosis of the lunate bone has been interpreted in the literature as a phenomenon with a traumatic, primarily vascular-arterial or mechanical causation.	0.5796055871903489
These models seem problematic, since neither the patients' histories nor the macroscopic-radiographical or histological appearances can be reconciled with them.	0.5158561400579749
In contrast, the model of a primarily venous aetiopathogenesis accepted for idiopathic necrosis of the femoral head is now examined.	0.5877519719745881
Evaluation of 125 cases of lunate bone necrosis treated in the Department of Orthopaedics at the University Hospital in Heidelberg between 1958 and 1993 made it possible to reconstruct the spontaneous course of the condition.	0.6378665224914245
X-Ray material, core spin tomographic images and material from a prospective study carried out in 49 patients with unexplained painful conditions of the wrist were available.	0.6469245407060491
A stage-by-stage progression emerged, which initially caused alterations only in the MR image, while the X-ray picture remained unremarkable.	0.7250348728187679
It was recognized from the spontaneous course that subsequent changes in the shape of the diseased lunate bones were always the result of the necrotic transformation process and never the cause of it.	0.6016552717745826
This meant that fractures were excluded as a possible cause of necrosis of the lunate bone.	0.5387917489655991
The spontaneous course was used as the basis of a stage-related classification for lunate bone necrosis.	0.7044094590837396
In a pressure measurement test, the behaviour of the intraosseous pressure in 16 necrotic lunate bones, 16 healthy lunate bones and 16 healthy capitate bones was tested under various functional conditions.	0.6061330664976663
The pressure fluctuations in the capitate bones were very slight, while in the healthy lunate bones pressure increased significantly during extension of the wrist.	0.5928757971154849
The position-dependent pressure increases in the lunate bones indicated that the venous drainage was constantly in jeopardy.	0.6120691155256702
The pressure increases in necrotic lunate bones were significantly in excess of those in healthy ones; in some cases they were far in excess of the systolic blood pressure.	0.6051655401147822
It was also concluded that necrotic lunate bones were mechanically deformed on movement.	0.4345557852891052
The anatomical causes of the pronounced pressure increases were examined experimentally.	0.44711138219123897
After staining of both the arteries and the veins, epoxy sheet plastination was used to fix six fresh cadaver arms in the neutral position and six in extension.	0.48438831836392643
Visualization of the vessels showed that capsular-ligamentous structures that were stretched on the palmar side and slackly turned back on themselves on the dorsal side still allowed the blood supply from the arteries, but substantially hindered venous drainage.	0.5242864739233964
The anatomical preparations made it possible to see that venous drainage from the lunate bone was being prevented; this explained the pronounced pressure increases.	0.48789752498468286
The unphysiological position of the base of the radius inclined in the palmar direction relative to the hand axis when it was extended dorsally was the crucial factor in the development of necrosis.	0.5100369013801909
Evaluation of the histories of the patients with necrosis of the lunate bone made it clear that trauma was not significantly involved in the causation, while manual work had an important role.	0.793814775195139
Most manual activites are performed with the wrist in extension.	0.46953617235143563
Any extension favours triggering of bone necrosis through congestion in the venous trunk.	0.3676853995724074
Thus, our investigations have shown that the beginning of this illness starts with congestion such as occurs with every extension of the wrist, which is initially physiological, before further factors favouring the process cause it to take a pathologic course.	0.7000144896379334
The results of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 confirm allergies as widespread diseases in Germany.	0.5863313337709923
In total 40 to 43 % of the adult population have or have had an allergic disease.	0.5846569112089306
The morbidity was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire and a personal interview performed by a physician.	0.5920162712124822

Mostly class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as lidocaine or ajmaline, are preferred.	0.49146027843170814
In hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia, electrical cardioversion should be applied, in case of recurrences, followed by pharmaclogical treatment with class I antiarrhythmic drugs or amiodarone.	0.5706772668421041
For the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death, -blockers and/or amiodarone are the only effective drugs.	0.8334033121830925

The result of an investigation of 128 from 283 (45,2%) medical and psychological psychotherapists established in the city of Hannover is presented.	0.7376416962095435
The aim of the study is to characterize the situation of psychotherapeutical care not only by the number of psychotherapists in relation to inhabitants but also by the working time spent for psychotherapy.	0.6596623608663319
Besides we found gender, school of psychotherapy and professional experience as factor influencing the patients waiting time for beginning a psychotherapy.	0.470222648997865

The surgical management of vesicovaginal fistulae (VVF) is a matter of controversy.	0.5556751560015019
This study deals with our experience with transvaginally treated patients suffering from VVF.	0.4734582457075473
Between 1966 and 1996, 64 patients with VVF were treated surgically.	0.4998912759899789
The VVF occurred in the course of hysterectomy in 54 patients, was due to radiotherapy in 7, was a result of obstetric complications in 2 patients, and occurred after colporrhaphy in 1 patient.	0.7189632405092576
In 60 of these 64 patients closure of the fistula was carried out transvaginally.	0.556471415681015
Fourteen of these 60 patients (23 %) had undergone prior surgical attempts to close the VVF (1 to 3 procedures).	0.706248909749575
Transvaginal surgery was successful at first attempt in 55 of these 60 patients (92 %).	0.46067224192623635
The other 5 patients were successfully treated by a second procedure (again transvaginal: n = 3; transabdominal: n = 2).	0.5321272456317055
In conclusion, the transvaginal approach to close VVF is of advantage, avoiding an abdominal incision and reducing postoperative morbidity.	0.4638292391390811
In the vast majority of the cases isolated VVF can be treated successfully by transvaginal repair.	0.7165105264754552

The underlying mutation is an expanding trinucleotide CTG repeat in the 3'prime untranslated region of a serine-threonine kinase gene on chromosome 19q.	0.34632855603544405
A statistical correlation exists between the CTG copy number and the severity of the disease.	0.45192903101451365
Infants with severe congenital myotonic dystrophy have been shown to have on average a greater amplification of the CTG repeat than is seen in the non-congenital myotonic dystrophy population.	0.5189807312250377
However, not all patients with many CTG copies develop congenital myotonic dystrophy.	0.6188817247799271

In 300 patients with 339 coronary lesions the percent diameter stenosis (%-DS) was assessed both by visual estimation and by digital quantitative coronary angiography (DQCA) by use of an on-line computer workstation.	0.7551161626633417
The decision for coronary angioplasty in the same setting ("prima vista"-PTCA) was based on history, evidence of ischemia and visual estimation of %-DS.	0.8901387134543752
DQCA measurements of the 339 stenoses revealed a normal distribution of lesion severity with a mean of 58.4  +/-  11.3%.	0.7941386089179208
In contrast to DQCA visual estimation led to a bimodal distribution with a nadir at ~55% between two peaks at ~45% and ~75% and a mean of 70.5  +/-  19.6%.	0.8615873667325753
Visual estimation underestimated lesions in the range of 30-55% and overestimated the %-DS between 55-99%.	0.7536835575923281
Visual estimation revealed a %-DS >= 60% in 251 stenoses (74.0%) of the 339 lesions, an estimate that led to subsequent "prima vista"-PTCA.	0.7647836111326901
Conversely, DQCA revealed only 184 stenoses (54.3%) with a %-DS >= 60%; thus, 86 stenoses (25.3%) did not meet the morphologic indication criteria for PTCA.	0.6709590353836513
The bimodal distribution of stenosis severity according to visual analysis with an overestimation of borderline stenosis severity reflects a tendency for "self-referral" of patients for PTCA.	0.6104512211073436
DQCA serves as an objective tool in the decision-making process for PTCA and may reduce "cosmetic" interventions or justify to defer PTCA.	0.5544117404416913
Especially in the selection process for "prima vista"-PTCA DQCA-quantification of stenosis severity is recommended.	0.5876401271809945
S-100 protein and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) serum concentrations serve as markers of cerebral damage in cardiac surgery, neurology, or after head injury.	0.5960439175022959
In these circumstances, S-100 and NSE levels correspond with the results of neuropsychological tests.	0.6007578442127799
The present study investigated the diagnostic value in orthopaedic patients after joint replacement.	0.6018950053334253
Since its introduction in clinical use more than ten years ago, propofol is well appreciated for sedation and supplemental hypnosis in anaesthesia.	0.450491731921621
However the substance is approved only for anaesthesia in children elder than three years.	0.3687014675395467
As can be substantiated by many data reported in literature, there are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic reasons whatsoever to withhold propofol from the younger children; this applies both to the use as a narcotic supplement and as a short term hypnotic for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.	0.6198737181825678
Orthostatic circulatory disorders are frequently the cause of orthostatic intolerance, syncope or dangerous falls.	0.4262370952489022
A sufficient therapy should be based on a differential diagnosis by means of an active standing test or a tilt-table test.	0.6040765302284304
Three typical pathological reactions of blood pressure and heart rate can be differentiated.	0.5417481829748495
The hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension is characterised by an immediate drop in blood pressure (systolic drop >20 mmHg below base line within 3 min) with or without compensatory tachycardia.	0.6086679756634887
It is caused by peripheral or central sympathetic dysfunction.	0.3212692620320802
Tachycardia (>30 beats per minute above base line within 10 min) without significant blood pressure drop but with a fall of cerebral blood flow indicates a postural tachycardia syndrome.	0.6905713165276451
In general, there is no further somatic dysfunction.	0.5651460040099952
Increased venous pooling is thought to be the assumed pathomechanism.	0.5928909911250708
A reflex mechanism evokes the neurocardiogenic syncope after a certain time of standing: sympathetic inhibition yields a strong blood pressure drop and vagal activation bradycardia.	0.34913681522238615
Proved therapies include use of the mineralocorticoide fludrocortison (hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension), of the a-agonist midodrin (postural tachycardia syndrome) and of b-blockers (neurocardiogenic syncope).	0.6341855580223301
There are numerous diseases which can irreversibly stiffen the whole spine or parts of the axial skeleton.	0.4215174907829643
Due to didactic reasons one can distinguish 3 gropus of such disorders: -  Paradigmatic diseases of the spine with an inherent proneness to stiffness.	0.6310702859171532
-  Rare diseases which involve a certain danger of stiffening the spine.	0.5369660665288927
-  Rigidity of the spine due to scientifically unrecognised morphologic phenomena.	0.6921060727397055
Modern approaches in knee endoprosthetics using computer-assisted navigation systems are based on matching procedures which refer to osseous anatomical landmarks.	0.43406467314930686
However, surface replacement techniques require a correct position of the implants in relation to the bone, as well as an optimal postoperative interaction of the ligaments and the surface design of the endoprosthesis.	0.6550775100076466
Functional aspects are of elementary importance.	0.2902822541415402
A 79-year-old man died of fatal haemorrhage into the soft tissue of the true pelvis 2 days after transrectal ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsy.	0.580865089410763
Autopsy revealed a perforation of the left prostatic lobe with ruptures of the periprostatic vessels.	0.5798822117513035
A similar case of transrectal prostatic biopsy-associated complication has not been described previously.	0.5500934642055952
The judicial enquiries were discontinued.	0.09196418346783303
Several different theories exist about the orign of kinetosis and the space adaption syndrome, with individual sensitivities differing significantly.	0.44532902512078004
One explanation involves the hypothesis of a different otolith mass between the right and left statolith organ and especially a difference in the utricles.	0.5350444868239255
A difference in mass results in a different sensitivity to acceleration.	0.572833095226153
For this reason we measured interindividual variances in saccular and utricular otolith mass.	0.3518313601470941
Since the anatomy of the vestibular organ in vertebrates is based as similar principles, we selected fish (salmon and trout) as our study model to facilitation preparations.	0.5238929728003646
The maximum difference in mass in the saccule was 17% and was generally smaller in the utricle, although in individual cases was much higher.	0.7128057741352288
We assume that a misbalanced sensitivity of the statolith organs occurs but is totally compensated for by the vestibular system as long as physiological motion patterns take place.	0.5035690257580525
Decompensation leads to kinetosis under non-physiological motion patterns.	0.23701637319170274
When the vestibular system is better balanced and has an equally distributed otolith mass to both sides, the possibility for developing kinetosis or space adaption syndrome is much less likely.	0.5189046412643771
The clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of haematogenous multifocal osteomyelitis, a rare illness, are described.	0.8144565697656259
Of clinical note are the pain, pseudoparalyses and restriction of movement.	0.3386691369001409
Staphylococcus aureus was the pathogen in both of the cases we described.	0.6271578186890522
Sonography is a useful diagnostic tool for the localization of subperiosteal abscesses; scintigraphy is a supplementary examination for cases where it is difficult to establish a diagnosis.	0.6309503618740699
MR-tomography is the most reliable method for examination of proximal infected foci (spondylitis, pelvis osteomyelitis).	0.5695975421642804
In our view, the earliest possible removal of all infected foci by means of operation and parenteral antibiotics mare the most important treatment.	0.6354878560389666
Interactions between the endocrine and immune systems are well known with special regard to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.	0.46372077800718114
Little of the literature focuses on the complex effects of cytokines on tissue responsiveness to glucocorticoids (GC).	0.5491610374361522
In bone tissue, osteoblasts represent a valuable model for studying GC-cytokine interactions.	0.43666070536315765
Hence, we have studied two human osteosarcoma cell lines (Saos-2 and MG-63) with different degrees of differentiation and different constitutive IL-6 production (3.4 +/- 0.3 (mean  +/- SE) and 3309 +/- 578 pg/106 cells).	0.8196389186312298
We measured glucocorticoid receptor (GR) number and affinity as a function of the exposure of cells to different amounts of IL-6.	0.5219230764331959
Incubation for 20 h with IL-6 at increasing concentrations up to 2000 pg/ml yielded a significant increase of GR binding sites in both cell lines.	0.5000112227598605
IL-6 was also able to reverse the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone (1 Âµmol/l) on GR in both cell lines.	0.6145954408822838
In MG-63 cells, expressing higher concentrations of GR, IL-6 deprivation via a specific anti-IL-6 antibody (100 ng/ml) significantly decreased GR.	0.581290978217211
In Saos-2 cells, expressing lower concentrations of GR, a 40 h treatment with human IL-1 (10 ng/ml) significantly increased both IL-6 production and GR.	0.6617538155886459
This latter effect was completely abolished by co-treating the cells with the anti-IL-6 antibody.	0.4602110824691836
Our results provide evidence that IL-6 is an autocrine positive modulator of GR number in human osteoblasts.	0.42452949972266796
Tumor debulking of gastrointestinal tumors for the reduction of tumor mass is intended to improve subsequent treatment efficacy.	0.4558909247012728
However, in advanced malignant disease, this therapy is often associated with increased morbidity and lethality.	0.7639322024723831
Adjuvant therapies cannot be initiated when needed.	0.26177669860559366
Therefore, long-term survival remains unaffected.	0.6923041557991553
Advances in biomedical science provide preliminary explanations for these therapeutic problems.	0.3322372145708911
Modern therapeutic concepts like neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced tumors are based on these findings.	0.5368036965572021
The probability of complete R0 resections, necessary to improve long-term survival, can be enhanced by these therapies.	0.6613765621071879
The ongoing prospective neoadjuvant studies for gastrointestinal tumors are already very encouraging.	0.32492083173665703
The simulation of unilateral deafness is very rare.	0.41199846971833026
Objective findings are of special interest if it happens.	0.5505555433233184
A patient with alleged deafness on the left-hand side due to commotio cerebri was treated in our hospital.	0.5597760847909842
Pure tone audiometry showed deafness on the left-hand side and normal hearing on the right-hand side.	0.5227742377996683
However, stapedius reflexes were found ipsilaterally left as well as contralaterally right, at 0.5 to 2 kHz with a stimulation of approxamately 90 dB SPL.	0.5812388225876608
Transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were measured.	0.5366229173928307
The TEOAE had the same reproducibility but a very low response on both sides, such that inner ear function could not be evaluated.	0.6498103117321115
In comparison, the DP gram showed clear DP amplitudes over the whole frequency range on both sides.	0.5461393755637007
Nonphysiological DPs could be excluded by assessing the DP growth rate at three different frequencies.	0.49859627695253617
By means of brainstem electric response audiometry (BERA), with which the IV/V complex was detectable up to stimulation with 20 dB SPL clicks, and the Stenger test, a neural or central hearing loss could be excluded.	0.5888305498288068
Normal hearing on the left-hand side was thus confirmed.	0.4172280747381191
In cases of simulated deafness it is possible to prove a normal inner ear function by DPOAE.	0.5872273544269903
DPOAE therefore complements the list of potential audiological simulation tests.	0.2576378428416608
Controlled studies of adrenal steroids in premenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have revealed subtle and inconsistent decreases in glucocorticosteroid (GCS) function, but prominent deficiencies of adrenal androgens (AA).	0.5270440468720595
Such findings have suggested that hypoandrogenicity may predispose to RA in younger women.	0.4139641429034308
However, recent prospective studies of serum cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels before (x = 12 yrs) the onset of the disease (pre-RA) offer an alternative perspective.	0.7017239990669629
Significant dissociation of serum cortisol and DHEAS levels was found only in the subgroup of premenopausal women who developed RA before age 50.	0.4212512170013807
This subgroup alone had significant deficiency in serum DHEAS levels.	0.27071043884902335
A growing number of casualties and the increasing restrictions of funding will lead as a consequence to changes within the field of trauma surgery.	0.5604952565438981
Despite these developments trauma surgery must maintain its major responsibility towards the victims of accidents.	0.3291879425934207
Therefore the German Society for Trauma Surgery (DGU) has to face the future economic and social challenges to influence the coming changes.	0.6399803565127004
This role compromises the engagement in a continuous struggle for the high and global standard of injury care in Germany, for quality assessment, education and training, research and adequate public relations.	0.6389403248168873
This paper outlines the aspects and visions of future trauma surgery and the means which may continue to guaranty international acknowledged standard of trauma care in Germany.	0.461699174411836
Radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice in atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.	0.6645051157480545
Electrophysiologic investigations in 623 patients revealed eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation: Ablation of fast (I) or slow(II), modification of fast (III) or slow AV nodal pathways (IV), modification of both pathways (V), ablation of fast and modification of slow (VI), ablation of slow and modification of fast pathways (VII) and ablation of both pathways (VIII).	0.5760179088408958
The criteria of diagnosis of these eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation are described.	0.54240939124844
Follow-up showed fewer relapses in patients with ablation (0-2%) in comparison to patients with modification of a single AV nodal pathway (8-12%).	0.7969447626345261
Alteration of both pathways includes an increasing risk of total AV nodal block, which occured in 7 patients (1.1%).	0.7323080507575889
Detailed analysis of the mechanism of catheter ablation is recommended in all patients after radiofrequency current delivery for AV nodal reentrant tachycardia to estimate the risk of relapsing during follow-up or development of total AV block in the particular patient in case of a further ablation procedure.	0.7335260467802468
An increasing life expectancy leads to a higher number of persons aged 70-84 years and persons aged 85 years and older.	0.5089591983278134
Information concerning changes in the spectrum of psychiatric morbidity is rare.	0.6213242666248329
The Berlin Aging Study was based on a representative age- and gender-stratified sample (n = 516) of Berlin citizens aged 70-100 years and older.	0.629634259738906
In this interdisciplinary study, an intensive investigation was carried out by psychologists, sociologists, internists and psychiatrists.	0.576301838997182
This report focuses on subjectively reported complaints (Beschwerdeliste, BL), observed psychopathological symptomatology (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, BPRS) and psychiatric diagnoses following the criteria of DSM-III-R (based on the Geriatric Mental State Examination, GMS-A).	0.48989794420947474
On the self-rating scale (BL) 10 % of all persons reported severe subjective complaints, 32 % moderate complaints.	0.6453994095554072
On the BPRS, 17 % showed severe psychopathological symptomatology, 75 % at least mild symptoms.	0.8608444207033982
Following the criteria of DSM-III-R, 23.5 % of all persons had a psychiatric disease, 4.2 % a disease of severe intensity.	0.8580495029270246
When the DSM-III-R diagnoses "Not Otherwise Specified" (NOS) were included 40.4 % of all subjects were diagnosed by the clinical judgement of the psychiatrists to have a psychiatric disease.	0.7428813041919795
The most frequent psychiatric diseases were insomnia (18.8 %), depression NOS (17.8 %) and dementia (13.8 %).	0.7351224575236789
Dementia showed the well-known age-related increase, whereas no other incidences of psychiatric morbidity were age-related.	0.6836073639914951
Persons aged 70-84 years did not differ in the investigated psychiatric variables from persons aged 85 years and older, the only exception being the prevalence of dementia.	0.5980018210063455
A first overview concerning developmentary risk factors and protective factors for later psychic and psychosomatic disease is presented.	0.4391604980315232
Problems within the context of the collection of data and evaluation are discussed.	0.5607405183063299
We analyzed how psoriasis patients sought professional help and correlated it to their illness attitudes and feelings of stigmatization.	0.33011412223898234
Semi-structured interviews of 400 patients were reanalyzed to identify homogeneous groups concerning initial reactions at first manifestations of the disease.	0.4404855086832207
Four groups ("isolated", "stigmatized", "socially supported" and "non-stigmatized" patients) were found and cross-tabulated with five resulting groups of a second cluster-analysis concerning the "style" of the seeking behaviour of professional and paraprofessional help and medical measures against the psoriasis ("multi-users", "arranged mini-users", "waiting-room patients", "optimists" and "self- therapists").	0.7321402653761871
We were able to describe typical courses of illness behaviour depending on the initial reaction.	0.45543100943826037
The results are discussed with regard to the desirable identification of problematic patients within professional care units.	0.5272423993063575
The sonographic diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described.	0.6419682757535339
Malignant lymphomas are sonographically relatively uniform: initial enlargement of the lymph nodes and organs involved and disturbance of normal echo texture by mainly hypoechoic lesions can be found.	0.521262071568274
Generally, four sonographic patterns of infiltration are described: diffuse, small nodular, large nodular and bulky type.	0.5733644366851987
Secondary, tumor-related or inflammatory complications (e. g. dislocation or compression of vessels, thoracic inlet syndrome, venous thrombosis, ileus, urinary retention, abscess and effusion) can be sonographically evaluated.	0.672810406934126
Response to therapy correlates with normalization of size and echo texture and recovery from tumor-related complications.	0.561527944299276
Differential diagnosis with ultrasound is based on the topographic distribution and echo pattern of infiltration and, with certain restrictions, on the echogenicity of lesions and perfusion feasible with Doppler sonography.	0.6252209414704909
The primary diagnosis has to be established histologically.	0.6836858458343608
The treatment of acute posterior instabilities can involve a reconstructive procedure as well as an antidislocation augmentation.	0.5838077641088913
Tibial bony avulsion ruptures must be reconstructed.	0.19943606478490308
For the treatment of chronic posterior instabilities we used the patella tendon graft, which can be implanted by an anterior or posterior approach.	0.754418397845538
In cases of posterolateral instabilities, additional procedures are necessary.	0.4712237852334145
Ultrasound of the Achilles tendon is a suitable means of differentiating various diseases of the tendon and the surrounding tissue.	0.5550851609978319
Different forms of degenerative disease (tendinitis, peritendinitis or bursitis, fibroosteitis, and Haglund's disease) can be discriminated from rheumatic and metabolic diseases.	0.4732952622402278
Congenital and developmental abnormalities can also be detected.	0.3955953087641272
Tendon degeneration mainly occurs in the ventral part of the medial third of the tendon ("critical zone").	0.7879870447279764
Immature tissue in this area leads to temorary instability of the tendon with a high risk of rupture ("vulnerable phase").	0.756976702980401
With sonography, lesions of the Achilles tendon are visible early in the course of the disease.	0.4980197697027684
The German social security legislation has recognized only recently the concern of quality assessment in the field of social and medical services.	0.4943695181849588
The legal frame for quality assessment in the field of medical treatment was enacted in the sickness insurance provision (Social Code - Book V) only in 1989.	0.589830498649389
Quality assessment is considered to be a part of the production of medical services and, therefore, is regulated in the context of providing medical services.	0.679123950572293
The legal provisions do not establish standards for quality and quality assessment.	0.4285550320781156
Due to the variety of medical services, quality assessment is not regulated in an exhaustive or systematic manner.	0.6405164194729839
According to the law, providers of medical services (doctors, hospitals) are bound to participate in quality assessment.	0.6733287000030058
As internal quality assessment prevails in the definition of the various measures of quality assessment and the control of quality in all fields of medical treatment, external quality assessment is also prescribed for hospitals.	0.8065405466546767
Because the establishment of quality assessment is considered to be a part of the service production organization, consumers (patients) or their representatives are not involved in the definition, establishment, and control of quality assessment.	0.7840917946758844
The participation of patients should be provided by law.	0.5369008026277249
Introduction: Because of an increasing number of endoscopic hernia procedures, it is important to look into the possibility of standardizing these techniques helping surgeons to acquire the operative skills necessary.	0.6195762954084141
Material and Methods: To discuss these aspects, the documented data on TAPP operations that have been carried out in this department since 1993 were analyzed.	0.623998996936747
The results of teaching procedures were compared with those of experts after they had gotten past the learning and development curve.	0.6290120387291612
Results: A total of 778 teaching procedures were performed by 10 surgeons with an individual experience of 30.5 operations (median).	0.6443763108041111
Before starting the first procedure, 89 were done by assistants operating the camera.	0.4919087233757203
The morbidity of teaching operations was 1.9 % compared to 1.4 % for those performed by experts.	0.7840774248056496
After a median follow-up of 23 months there were two recurrences (0.23 %) in the expert group and none in the teaching group (follow-up 16 months).	0.6883801789886175
Conclusion: Because of the potentials of standardization of the TAPP technique, the results of teaching were equal to expert operations.	0.719086067077281
Therefore, TAPP is suitable for application in a routine setting.	0.5407320083265534
In spite of the high and lasting efficiency of transurethral prostatectomy, intraoperative blood loss results in increased morbidity in this procedure.	0.6616086023860475
This led to the development of many alternative treatment modalities in the last years.	0.6782105307564914
To minimize the risk of bleeding, we improved the high-frequency technology in several steps.	0.8057170385256323
To achieve this, the output signals of commercially available high-frequency generators were modulated to the effect that each cut results in an efficient coagulation zone in the tissue at excellent cutting quality.	0.6510632383036519
Laboratory and in vitro studies using porcine kidneys as well as clinical trials showed good cutting characteristics accompanied by a significant reduction of bleeding.	0.6374596231859031
As a result, blood transfusions were less necessary, the transurethral catheter could be removed earlier in the postoperative period, and hospitalization time was significantly reduced.	0.7504170551893682
In conclusion, the improved high-frequency technology in form of the "coagulating intermittent cutting" results in a blood-sparing tissue resection with a consecutive reduction of morbidity.	0.6608957533840027
An accurate assessment of the duration of the ability to act following fatal poisoning can be of major importance in reconstructing circumstances leading to death, especially in determining whether the poisoning was accidental, self-inflicted, or the result of a criminal act.	0.7240483993594856
Clinical publications have scarcely dealt with this problem.	0.236576845112053
We therefore examined 20 legal autopsies performed at the Institutes of Forensic Medicine of the Universities of WÃ¼rzburg and Leipzig as well as the respective records of the police and prosecuting attorney's offices in an effort to clarify this question.	0.4531274689942692
As a rule the victims retained the ability to act for 10-15 min.	0.5634144350895255
However, the material we examined and the literature also contain cases in which the ability to act lasted considerably longer.	0.7815614514435075
The present study is intended to provide expert witnesses with guidelines for clarification of cases of fatal intoxication.	0.6580394776810197
Androgenablation is the therapy of choice for the treatment of advanced and metastatic prostate cancer.	0.5557406138985238
However, in more than half of the patients the disease will ultimately progress within 2 years.	0.7709777334338369
Intermittent androgenablation through medical castration maintains the apoptotic potential.	0.20344526585049866
By periodically changing phases on and off treatment the quality of life of the patients is improved.	0.7457242511978006
Apart from reduced toxicity treatment costs are lowered and tumor progression is possibly delayed.	0.3452704639284237
In how far survival is influenced is presently not clear and remains to be evaluated in further clinical trials.	0.49451682791888213
During pressure support ventilation (PSV), the timing of the breathing cycle is mainly controlled by the patient.	0.5783600402025196
Therefore, the delivered flow pattern during PSV might be better synchronised with the patient's demands than during volume-assisted ventilation.	0.6072567469811635
In several modern ventilators, inspiration is terminated when the inspiratory flow decreases to 25% of the initial peak value.	0.5389178395357552
However, this timing algorithm might cause premature inspiration termination if the initial peak flow is high.	0.5625965970742848
This could result not only in an increased risk of dyssynchronization between the patient and the ventilator, but also in reduced ventilatory support.	0.8588319465604456
On the other hand, a decreased peak flow might inappropriately increase the patient's inspiratory effort.	0.5559745776369802
The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of the variation of the initial peak-flow rate during PSV on respiratory pattern and mechanical work of breathing.	0.6859393469822342
To date, positron emission tomography (PET) is the most powerful tool for the non-invasive study of biochemical processes.	0.6720868761518893
Besides its usefulness for basic research PET has been proven to be superior to conventional diagnostic methods in several clinical indications.	0.5224206007418535
However, the introduction of PET into clinical practice has been hindered considerably by its costs.	0.5822085063395748
Several American studies lend support to the hypothesis that PET may be more cost-effective than the conventional diagnostic work-up - at least for some of its clinical indications.	0.750041970974519
In Germany, however, this hypothesis has still not been verified.	0.5897944477806437
The rapid growth, development and organ differentiation during early human development depend on an adequate and balanced substrate availability.	0.46753753107313684
It is well known that early nutrition has short term effects (e.g.	0.4005515553834242
on growth), and that marked metabolic imbalances in infancy (e.g.	0.48057484930883215
hypoglycaemia, phenylketonuria) have long term effects on child development.	0.5752367313363383
More recent studies indicate that also variations of metabolic conditions within the normal range, which occur during sensitive periods of early human development, may have marked long term effects on later prognosis and disease risks in adulthood.	0.629682598439915
This metabolic programming was demonstrated in epidemiologic studies indicating close relationships between indicators of early growth and the disease incidence and the mortality of coronary heart disease in late adulthood.	0.5357728563724994
Long term effects of infant feeding on immunological functions are indicated by the effects of infant feeds on later prevalence of allergic disease and by the difference in morbidity for diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease and malignant lymphoma between previously breast fed and formula fed infants.	0.5868552768112258
An improved understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that modulate these observed long term effects is required to enable effective preventive interventions.	0.5799370816328595
Already the available information indicates a great potential for actively improving long term child health and development by an improved substrate supply during pregnancy and infancy.	0.4275061371598023
Persons who cross international boundaries are at increased risk of contracting infectious diseases.	0.39198452265463996
An analysis of the reported communicable diseases in Germany shows: A large number of cases of typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, shigella infections, trichinellosis and brucellosis notified during the last years in Germany originated from foreign countries.	0.5934509472672398
Intervention measures are necessary, above all, with regard to gastrointestinal infections and vaccine-preventable diseases.	0.4671390083714508
Bilateral testicular tumors account for approximately 3,5 % of all testicular malignancies and to our knowlegde about 800 cases are reported in the literature.	0.6254440420216971
An even more seldom event is the appearance of a testicular germ cell tumor with a contralateral benign non-germ cell tumor.	0.505927618706703
We report the 6th case of such a coincidence.	0.7166543939304801
The dignity of a contralateral tumor should be assured by frozen section and in case of benign histology organ preserving therapy is indicated.	0.36948864685130883
Even in cases of bilateral testis cancer tumor enucleation may be considered, if the strict conditions for resection and follow-up are respected.	0.5807357303734153
Most sudden cardiac deaths are arrhythmic.	0.2589976055481446
Besides the known effects of beta-blockers, among true antiarrhythmic drugs only amiodarone seemed to reduce total cardiac mortality in patients at risk.	0.5334283125198839
Reevaluation of amiodarone with or without a beta-blocker in primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death after review of recent publications.	0.44626861905742926
Only augmentation of case numbers by meta-analyses of controlled trials could demonstrate that amiodarone not only reduces sudden cardiac death but also diminishes total cardiac mortality.	0.43495943199327824
However, the number of avoided sudden deaths is small in comparison to the number of treated cases.	0.573285106464742
This and specific side effects of amiodarone contradict a general primary prophylaxis with this drug.	0.5417379415100269
An additional benefit by combining amiodarone with beta-blockers seems to exist but has to be proven by further studies.	0.5416190831477574
At present, primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death with amiodarone with or without a beta-blocker is an individual decision in all cases with special risk considerations.	0.5720966753817117
As a result of a critical review of the literature and a survey at German epilepsy centers of usual pre- and postoperative drug treatment, the following strategy is recommended:	0.8497978936197833
An ecological theory of remembering is formulated which is based on the patterns of meaningfulness in the social and spatial environment.	0.4899433219842125
The specific ecological relationship to the environment is affinitive, and also opens access to the ressources of the past.	0.5915291651526939
In the present study, conditions for this access (in particular with older people) were investigated.	0.8497211036957153
It is assumed that older people, especially, when they lose someone with whom they had a fixed relationship seek counselling and that abrupt changes in the spatial environment, such as moving to a home, are rejected by older people.	0.6347063881290572
These hypotheses were checked on the basis of material (N=120) gathered in a counselling service for the aged and they were essentially confirmed.	0.407043270961433
To make matters clear, "typical" and thus every-day experiences of maintenance and loss of competence are cited from the material.	0.6629660575005384
Finally, practical conclusions are drawn with regard to work with the aged.	0.4092122438317275
Following Shouldice repair of a primary inguinal hernia 50 patients were given subcutaneous Redon drains, while another 50 patients underwent operations without drains in a prospective randomized trial.	0.6219132954439166
The amount of postoperative wound secretion in the drainage bottle was added to fluid retention established by sonographic volumetric analysis.	0.40125482594865275
The degree of personal impairment was estimated by a visual analogue score.	0.5513431209394692
Inflammation parameters were recorded as well as the rate of complications.	0.662161018183566
The drain group showed significantly increased fluid production in comparison to the group without drains on the 1st postoperative day (36.0 vs. 2.5 ml).	0.8518160887048162
Wound sepsis was found in two patients in the drain group.	0.7925204636422943
Seven patients with drains and eight patients without underwent percutaneous seroma puncture.	0.3857936653790643
The drain only slightly affected personal impairment (25.6 % vs 21.4 %, visual analogue score).	0.6854991651967496
Body temperature was elevated in the drain group on the 3rd day after operation (37.2 vs 36.7  Â°C).	0.7100076381299407
We believe there is no indication for the routine use of a Redon drain in the repair of a primary inguinal hernia.	0.731913096970841
Instead, percutaneous puncture of subcutaneous fluid retentions should be performed.	0.4693560023384706
We report on three arterial thromboses of the external iliac artery following total hip replacement.	0.6446581512666252
As a result of implanted cement/spongiosa or protrusion of the acetabular component, the iliac vessels were compressed.	0.5826388021926944
Furthermore, we report about one intraoperative arterial vessel lesion in a 65-year-old patient during a revision operation.	0.8241672629804433
We recommend that in case of acute ischemic syndromes of lower limbs following total hip replacement, an angiography should be performed in order to exclude an extravascular cause of thrombosis.	0.7176891883178543
For therapy in those cases extra-anatomic bypasses should be preferred to thrombectomies.	0.5294375806391822
One of the most important occupations of manual therapists is the treatment of hypomobilities of intervertebral joints.	0.5595789226588267
Such hypomobilities of the spine are treated with different kind of manipulations or mobilisations.	0.5909389113960397
The pathophysiological basis of hypomobilities is subject of discussion.	0.3947330165381292
Objective criteria for the diagnosis of disturbed spinal mobility are missing.	0.5044387887886246
They are not detectable in X-ray, computertomography or NMR.	0.5141187636267672
In this article, we report on a family in which five examined members showed clinical signs of Fechtner syndrome, a condition which consists of hearing loss (49%), macrothrombocytopenia (100%), leukocyte inclusion bodies (100%), eye anomalies (54.3%), and nephritis (38.7%).	0.6367486627508193
This article describes how tissue culture has developed from an observing method to a powerful analytical technique for oncology and for pathological cell changes such as metabolic disorders and degenerative diseas es.	0.46011534183720454
Standard terms are defined and basic methods are explained.	0.3044360746394355
Different models of in vitro culture - monolayer, three-dimensional tumor cultures, and organ cultures - are critically reviewed in respect of their significance for the interpret ation of in vivo tissue.	0.72042477855158
Two important recent extensions of tissue culture, serum-free cell culture and the introduction of genetic material into cells, are described.	0.5767612527867475
The objective of this prospective, randomised study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting (PONV) during the first 24 h postoperatively.	0.7950724879976855
For a quality assurance study on PONV, we compared two established general anaesthetic procedures in 239 patients undergoing four different types of surgery (subtotal thyroidectomy, laparotomy for gynaecological procedures, laparoscopy, and surgery for extra-abdominal procedures).	0.5764108227366205
The historical opinion that the intima layer of a ruptured artery of muscular type could stop bleeding by "rolling in" should be controlled experimentally.	0.4862908434027019
Five segments of human femoral/popliteal artery (3-4 cm long) were overstretched until complete rupture occured.	0.6906836037739726
Furthermore a longitudinally split and a partially oblique incised segment were ruptured.	0.2942811866747065
As morphological findings a sandclock deformity was observed in the region of rupture.	0.5626995928188764
This phenomenon was induced by adventitia layer, which closed the ends of ruptured media layer like a Chinese finger trap.	0.5390404205818288
In the longitudinally split segment a transverse rupture of the media layer could be observed, while the fibers of adventitia layer were pulled out when the traction was continued.	0.5538166825026073
Neither macroscopical nor microscopical signs could be found for "rolling in" of intima or media layer.	0.447063457785287
The reason for spontaneous hemostasis after arterial rupture is more likely the activation of platelets by collagenous fibers of adventitia layer than "rolling in" of intima or media layer.	0.4531929446041693
If there is no finger trap mechanism of adventitia layer like in shot- or stabwounds a massive blood loss must be expected.	0.5686494373388484
Time and again a lack of staff in the field of people's nursing is discussed (chronic lack of nursing staff); this means that there are not enough people to do the available work) (1).	0.5748902415061469
However, the time factor is also an important sociological dimension in old people's stationary care.	0.712161087426745
First of all, this article points out the time dimension throughout life.	0.5996147565905484
This is followed by people's varying perceptions of the present and the related upsets and misunderstandings.	0.6683543379810482
Hereby the contradictory abundance and limitation in time as felt by the elderly also becomes apparent.	0.3708321408519284
The old people's awareness of the dwindling remainder of their own lifespans conflicts with the seemingly endless time of each day that passes.	0.3834657947021957
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has evolved to a research tool to an intrinsic part of modern invasive cardiology.	0.5437881478452408
The main reason is the capability to obtain "in-vivo" micro anatomy by means of miniaturized echo-transducers with an outer diameter of 2.9-3.5 French.	0.6998083376740433
For the first time it is possible to base decisions not only on lumenograms but also on vessel wall assessment.	0.7153799087357673
The capabilities of IVUS can be divided in its diagnostic and intervention associated potentials.	0.5170849356996134
The diagnostic strength of IVUS is the ability to monitor compensatory coronary artery enlargement as a response to arteriosclerosis, to assess intermediate lesions, to reveal occult left main stem disease, and angiographically "silent" arteriosclerosis.	0.6361077210597267
In conjunction with the estimation of intracoronary flow reserve, patients with the diagnosis of coronary "syndrome X" can be better classified into those with or without early signs of arteriosclerosis.	0.6954178433307909
Additionally, IVUS is at present the only method allowing the classification of coronary artery lesions according to the AHA/ACC Stary classification.	0.6227347812012657
Introduction: The chronic exertional compartment syndrome of the musculus tibialis anterior is thought to be responsible for a major part of complaints of the lower leg among active sportsmen.	0.6389889847048857
There is an important role of tissue pressure measurement in diagnosing chronic anterior compartment syndrome during muscular activity.	0.7726402954048661
However, there is a controversial debate about the relevant parameters.	0.6652350020305656
The development of frontal sinuses following bilateral fronto-orbital advancement is a topic of controversial discussion in the literature.	0.4325518617455129
In a retrospective study on 33 patients (15 girls and 18 boys) the development of the frontal sinus was examined radiologically.	0.7620956632373813
Only patients with a minimum age of 6 years and with at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up were included.	0.7599687175740957
The radiological reference for the frontal sinus development consisted of pneumatisation at or above the level of the supraorbital rims, as projected in postero-anterior cephalograms.	0.5390313481003075
According to these criteria a frontal sinus development was seen in 72.7% of our patients.	0.7742882751690165
There was no statistically proven correlation between sinus development and the sex of the patient, age at surgery or the amount of advancement.	0.7336907370798319
With the exception of severe cases of Crouzon's disease we usually expect normal development of the frontal sinus following bilateral fronto-orbital correction.	0.5346802767127844
Failures after ankle arthrodesis are, according to the literature and our own experience, more frequently seen with external fixation than with internal fixation methods.	0.7665456630560723
Favourable results can be obtained with the standard four-screw technique, preservation of the ankle and the biomechanical axes seeing only one non-union in 44 own cases with this technique.	0.6900803470603014
A vital X-ray imaging technique in oral and craniomaxillofacial surgery is the panoramic X-ray.	0.5220903957236622
Due to its variety of special projections, including imaging of the transversal level and low exposure to radiation, it is suitable for answering many clinical questions and for diagnostics of various findings.	0.6397244822343817
It has become possible to minimize the necessary doses by further development of technology and devices, as well as of X-ray films and by new detection systems, such as sensors or screens.	0.6593875115134157
In some clinical cases, the diagnostic deficiencies of conventional imaging techniques make computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging indispensable.	0.6198927523507122
Although MR is particularly suitable for soft tissue imaging, it has also become helpful in finding cortical changes by shorter measuring times.	0.5563404889529099
In certain cases, e. g., changes to bone metabolism, differentiated methods of nuclear medicine make image-aided analysis of function possible.	0.488845687871166
Secondary haematogenous joint involvement is seen in less than 1 % of patients with Salmonella infections.	0.7383493156321899
These atypical infections are frequently encouraged by pre-existing local or systemic disease.	0.47007971235368795
We present a case of a patient with known alcohol abuse who developed a septic infection of her right hip requiring resection of the femoral head.	0.7013405777917653
Histologic analysis showed signs of pre-existing osteonecrosis probably induced by alcohol intake.	0.4349980205740445
Cartilage and bone were invaded and destructed by an aggressive granulation tissue.	0.42117364910128774
Initially, a biopsy evaluated without knowledge of the positive bacteriological result had been interpreted as indicative of a tumour.	0.5115837240427044
The onset, clinical course, diagnosis and therapy of joint involvement by Salmonella are discussed with regard to our case and the relevant literature.	0.6753409518289681
This case illustrates the necessity for clinicians to share all their information about the patient with the pathologist.	0.6047412400568521
There are two types of diabetes mellitus.	0.5642076968680675
Type I, insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM), which becomes manifest before the age of 40, is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin.	0.738127229050321
Type II, the non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM), develops in the elderly and is caused by a relative insulin deficiency.	0.6071662687196009
Patients with type-I diabetes are prone to the development of ketoacidosis, while type II causes hyperglycaemic, hyperosmolar, nonketotic coma.	0.5411776662063251
Apart from these acute metabolic alterations, the long-term complications of diabetes are of concern to the anaesthesiologist.	0.5992975371514815
Hypertension, coronary artery disease, renal insufficiency and autonomic neuropathy are common and can result in myocardial ischaemia, cardiovascular instability and gastroparesis, with an increased risk of aspiration.	0.8071795948299193
Limited movement of the atlanto-occipital joint can cause difficult intubation.	0.38297079125625394
To avoid perioperative metabolic catastrophy, blood glucose concentration should be kept between 6.7 and 10 mmol - l-1 (120 - 180 mg - dl-1).	0.7117980923798093
Hypoglycaemia can result in neurological damage, whereas hyperglycaemia causes impaired wound healing and susceptibility to infections and worsens ischaemic damage to the myocardium and brain.	0.6081233337757643
Perioperative diabetes management depends on the severity of the surgical procedure and the type of diabetes.	0.7218402933785266
All type-I diabetics, whatever operation being performed, need insulin.	0.4419578551953353
The intravenous route is recommended as it allows better adjustment.	0.5653802167239573
After determination of the fasting blood glucose level, insulin is given at a dosage of 0.5 - 1 U - h-1 (at gluc<11.1 mmol - l-1), 1.5 - 2 U - h-1 (at gluc 11.1 - 16.7 mmol - l-1) or 3  U - h-1 (at gluc>16.7 mmol - l-1).	0.7870540888073756
In addition, 5 - 10 g glucose - h-1 is given.	0.7679676670980418
In type-II diabetes the oral antidiabetic drug is withheld.	0.41977971814748144
During minor surgery the blood glucose concentration is monitored frequently, and if necessary insulin (with gluc>13.9 mmol - l-1) or glucose is given.	0.6865588374233945
In most cases of major surgery insulin therapy will be necessary.	0.5811868196181893
Administration should follow the guidelines listed for type-I diabetes.	0.3948314133514092
Whether the intravenous or the subcutaneous route is used for insulin, repeated glucose determinations are mandatory.	0.4871422985176683
If ketoacidosis develops the volume depletion is treated with normal saline.	0.40113633801089116
For hyperglycaemia and acidosis insulin (3 - 6 U - h-1) with 10 - 20 mmol - h-1 potassium phosphate is given.	0.7727656330091021
Bicarbonate is only indicated when the serum pH is lower than 7.1.	0.5894655814528881
It must be borne in mind that perioperative management of diabetes does not end with postanaesthesia care.	0.4050119540708788
At the beginning of the 19 th century, institutional care for the insane was established by the various German states.	0.5204296168725508
At first, the separation of curable and incurable patients influenced psychiatric care and the construction of hospitals.	0.5481850351682067
The combination of care and cure in one hospital in Illenau was a turning point in institutional care.	0.4515896657432816
Contradictory tendencies characterized the second half of the 19 th century: the integration with general medicine in the cities, on the one hand, the social separation and cure in the seclusion of the countryside, on the other.	0.6187317433221539
The characteristic psychiatric construction in different countries was influenced by individual architects.	0.32385194764753006
The following building styles were dominant: in England, panoptic architecture; in the United States, linear staggered structures; in France, the "carrÃ©s isolÃ©s"; and in Germany, the structure of blocks with cross-axes.	0.6580648914448729
At the end of the 19 th century, the system of pavilions was internationally accepted; occupational therapy and mental care in the countryside were introduced.	0.5129737807701046
From the First World War until the end of the 1960 s, a standstill in psychiatric buildings was noted in Germany, and institutional care came under increasing criticism.	0.5723442279119197
