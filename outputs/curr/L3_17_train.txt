In 16% of cases one or both renal arteries or the inferior mesenteric or the internal iliac artery were reimplanted.	1.1880842676578167
For further analysis the patients were split in three groups: elective group 1, symptomatic group 2, ruptured group 3.	1.0577114329375237
Significant differences were found in the aneurysmal diameter, distribution of gender (128 M, 14 F), renal artery involvement, or concomitant peripheral arteriosclerosis as well as for the risk factors tobacco smoking, hyperlipidemia, renal insufficiency, and the presence of multiple risk factors.	1.2032481047724974
Group 1 had a significantly higher preoperative hospital stay than group 2; whereas the intensive care stay was significantly longer in group 3 than in the other two groups.	1.1426467131889257
Sixty-four percent of patients had no, 11% had more than one complication.	1.3653167455174136
Mortality was 0 in groups 1 and 2, but 35.3% in group 3.	1.2856925092791835
The most frequent complication in groups 1 and 2 was pneumonia (13.9%) followed by cardiac complications (4.6%), and renal insufficiency (3.7%).	1.2783109386167255
In group 3 respiratory insufficiency demonstrated the highest incidence (23.5%), followed by renal insufficiency (21%) and pneumonia (17.6%).	1.085743353356276
No patient of the nonoperated group suffered an aneurysm rupture; aneurysm diameters, except one, did not increase during the follow-up period.	0.9662756465495582
Of the 130 operated and discharged patients 31 died; in no case was death related to the operative procedure.	0.9064925400783905
No important complications were observed during the follow-up of 37.2 +/- 17.9 months.	1.13188828217981
Furthermore, the results are compared with those of the literature.	1.4458418779680124
Based on their observations the authors conclude that this retrospective quality check was rather awkward and involved giving partly incomplete data for lack of a prospective evaluation.	1.0122988911088737
Nevertheless, the results compared well with those in the literature and were satisfactory.	1.4346197672844943
We report on a 32-year-old male patient with advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), who had severe candidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract.	1.1614849596849832
Treatment with fluconazole, 200 mg/day, was introduced.	0.9251457400352977
After oral intake of fluconazole over 5 months itraconazole 200 mg/day was given for 1 month.	0.9670394183987281
However, fungal infection still persisted.	1.2019211718868865
The antifungal activity of fluconazole, itraconazole and ketoconazole against Candida albicans was evaluated by means of the microdilution test by determining the 90% inhibitory concentrations of each drugs.	0.9540287650716696
A high minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was detected for fluconazole (50 µg/ml) revealing fluconazole resistance.	1.0905487645734848
The susceptibility to itraconazole was borderline (MIC 0.125 µg/ml) and that to ketoconazole was markedly lowered (MIC 0.25 µg/ml).	0.9285206093125802
Plasma levels of itraconazole were also found to be lowered.	1.0145350627338077
In HIV patients the gastrointestinal absorption of azole derivatives is often reduced.	0.8381177848202199
Therefore, the clinical resistance of Candida albicans to itraconazole can be explained by reduced susceptibility after azole therapy and also by the decreased absorption of the drug in HIV patients.	1.2159236935745905
Patients suffering from soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities may sometimes require vascular reconstruction to remove the tumor with adequate margins of clearance.	0.9063911053703998
Besides this, recurrent lymph node metastases are often affixed to neighboring vessels.	0.9519485234419413
MRI and angiography represent the adequate diagnostic procedures.	0.7639595257269097
Vessel-invasive sarcoma can hardly be treated by surgical resection with curative intent alone.	0.9683951717665268
If there is doubt about invasion of arteries and veins, the vessels should be resected and replaced by autologous vein graft.	0.982549171534873
Soft tissue coverage is of major importance, particularly if prosthetic grafts are used or the resection is within an area of irradiated tissue.	1.0612938996840426
After radical resection and combined modality therapy, one can expect local recurrence rates similar to those without vessel invasion.	1.0467377779223195
To achieve this goal, surgical oncologists, vascular surgeons and plastic surgeons must work together.	1.1070847345342962
Today, amputation can hardly be justified even in vessel-invasive soft tissue tumors.	0.956588518047401
The study aimed to evaluate whether superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation (SHFJV) is a useful tool in intensive care medicine to ventilate patients with pulmonary insufficiency.	1.2052562808407155
Surgery on the lacrimal system in 296 children was performed at the Münster University Eye Hospital from 1987 to 1992.	0.903007348034913
The dermatology clinic in Krefeld has treated a wide range of patients since its founding in 1845.	0.9195359331867474
Nowadays the spectrum consists of allergology, occupational dermatology, phototherapy, dermatosurgery, phlebology and proctology as well as special clinics for andrology, sexually transmitted diseases and patients with HIV-infection.	0.8748030931703894
Background: Dapiprazole hydrochloride is an alpha-1-adrenergic inhibitor that anticipates the mydriatic effect of phenylephrine in dilator muscle receptors in a competitive way.	1.0456563752112156
The aim of this study was to determine for which indications for mydriasis pupil dilation by phenylephrine alone is sufficient and if the reversal by dapiprazole is convenient and the practical.	0.905524546796171
The Quality Assurance programmes of the social security insurance authorities are presented from the point of view of psychosomatic rehabilitation.	1.1080442161185045
This presentation attempts to introduce aspects of both Quality Assurance and Quality Management into the field of medical rehabilitation.	1.0280756965331066
The consequences of the programme for political order are emphasized.	0.709240122796333
The special features of the individual programme objectives are elaborated.	0.9315133466037335
In addition, the importance of each of these objectives for psychosomatic rehabilitation is examined.	0.9021008941303101
This field will inevitably have to adopt concepts of time and resource optimization.	0.8165745213845702
For many years the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome has been on the top of medical articles about the intensive care patient.	0.9813057575649466
While severity scores deal with the 1st ICU day physiology, the organ dysfunction systems aim to take in account the duration type and severity of physiologic disturbances during the ICU stay.	1.0108705941585008
Most of the published systems have been created by a panel of experts, giving to each dysfunction a number of points, usually 1 to 4, according to the severity.	1.0692802011740317
Only 2 systems are different: the MODS of Marshall et al.	0.8328043482423377
and the Logistic Organ Dysfunction LOD system of Le Gall et al., both published recently (1995 and 1996).	1.1011126762233192
They differ from the others because first they were created either from a literature review (MDOS) or from a logistic regression (LOD), and secondly, because neither takes into account the therapy.	1.1877168934703886
Besides, the LOD system, when used on the 1st ICU day, has statistical qualities which are very promising.	1.27099563930304
The LOD system is now used each consecutive day on septic patients in an European multicenter study.	0.8648084164008003
The relationsship between the growth of tumors and the expression of the protooncogen Bcl-2 could be shown in epithelial tumors.	1.035180824153782
A bcl-2 expression leads to a prolonged cell survival due to an inhibition of apoptosis.	1.0144455506461143
The potential meaning of bcl-2 expression in mesenchymal tumors remains still unknown.	0.7599878077033513
The fact, that the heterogenous group of osteosarkoma is not sufficiently characterized at present, suggested to investigate the bcl-2 expression in osteosarcoma.	1.0635951105466064
Thus, immunohistochemistry was used to analyze 47 specimens of different osteosarcomas of 36 patients.	1.1821242189498247
Sixteen cases (46 %) showed a strong expression of bcl-2 and 13 cases (35 %) were moderately positiv for bcl-2.	1.1364739325347073
Seven cases (19 %) were negative for bcl-2.	1.0625411997573597
The heterogenous, negative up to strong expression of bcl-2 yield clues, that the Bcl-2 controlled regulation of programmed cell death could be an important factor of cellular kinetics.	1.0845774097216343
Additionally the cellular proliferationrate was determined with the monoklonal antibody MIB 1, directed against the Ki-67 epitop.	0.8248836790757451
The data of bcl-2 expression and cellular proliferationrate lead to a classification correlating with the histological classification.	1.0751430550894305
To verify the importance of apoptosis in the genesis of mesenchymal tumors and whether Bcl-2 may play an important role as a predictive factor for the prognosis of osteosarcoma, further investigations will be needed.	1.0615180493140592
During a period of two weeks in hot dry midsummer 3 patients presented in our pediatric outpatient clinic after a bath in a small lake.	1.0491064772214238
They had an extremely itching, elevated exanthema mainly on their legs.	0.8997337516194345
The single efflorescence had a diameter of about 1-3 cm.	0.9232229351946495
There were no signs of infection or fever.	0.9554358064757495
Intussusception of the appendix vermiformis in adults is an uncommon event.	1.0548118832739977
The combination of a mucinous cystadenoma with an intussuscepted appendix is extremely rare.	0.7892051568744204
Clinical symptoms are nonspecific; in most cases the correct diagnosis is not made before surgical exploration.	1.1100115361778264
With the radiologic and endoscopic presentation of a polypoid lesion of the caecum, a neoplasm is often considered.	1.059112306998013
Endoscopic appendectomy or disinvagination by enema have been described.	0.5742928438293374
Thus the definitive therapy is surgery and depends on the histological diagnosis.	0.8814764252316635
There are some case reports about excessive heat production in the absorbent canister when sevoflurane or enflurane are washed into a circle containing dried soda lime.	0.8286951282605634
This observation was often made in the DRÄGER ISO 8 circle system with the gas inlet upstream of the soda lime canister with the gas-flow from bottom to top.	0.8889374085284683
Abstract:  MR-imaging of the spinal column using Turbo-Spin-Echo-Sequences (TSE) often shows flow-void structures resembling intraspinal vessels.	1.1262594124590026
Due to misinterpretation of those phenomenons invasive diagnostic procedures may be performed to diagnose an arteriovenous malformation (myelography, spinal angiography).	0.9724630523298887
Purpose: To compare the effectiveness of spiral CT versus conventional CT in the preoperative assessment of metallic intraocular foreign bodies.	1.0982347175817244
Surgery is still the primary therapeutic approach in treatment of tumors in the head and neck area, dating back to the early nineteenth century.	1.0173201880262175
More than 150 years ago, hemimaxillectomies and mandibular resections as well as hemiglossectomies were already performed by leading surgeons.	0.8614569705854581
The block principle we are now following dates back to Crile, who also established the principle of cervical lymph node dissection.	1.0180866566985078
Ablative oncologic surgery has always been closely linked with plastic and reconstructive surgery, rendering radical surgical interventions possible without disfiguring patients.	0.8862941426289593
The development of facial reconstructive surgery proceeded in stages, in the first instance as secondary reconstruction using tube pedicled flaps.	1.130040363768939
The change to the concept of primary reconstruction occurred via arterialized skin flaps and myocutaneous flaps to the widely accepted and performed free tissue transfer.	0.9041901169105948
Free bone grafting, inaugurated earlier and still representing the majority of bone grafting, has been supplemented for certain reconstructive purposes by free vascularized bone transfer from various donor sites.	1.003643081743759
Although the five-year-survival rate of carcinoma of the oral cavity has remained unchanged in the past 30 years, distinctive improvements in tumor surgery can be recorded.	1.1056162875001965
This is primarily based on improved diagnostics such as modern imaging techniques and the refinement of surgical techniques.	1.0106851232080845
The DÖSAK has worked out distinctive guidelines for effective ablative oncologic surgery.	0.7736684958768595
Surgical approaches offering wide exposure and carrying low morbidity play a decisive role in radical resections.	0.8010290748098312
For this reason, midfacial degloving offers an essential improvement for the resection of midface tumors, especially from an aesthetic point of view.	1.0577486747681866
Tumors situated deep behind the viscerocranium at the skull base can be clearly exposed either through a lateral approach following a temporary osteotomy of the mandibular ramus or a transmandibular, transmaxillar, or transfacial approach with minimal morbidity.	0.9166698405229335
Concerning the concept of neck dissection, radical techniques are more and more abandoned in favor of a more conservative procedure.	0.9180089626024324
Actual inquiries concerning present surgical procedures as to the surgical strategy in "No-neck" or marginal and segmental resection in mandibular adherent carcinomas demand scientific clarification.	1.0513245358870047
Laser treatment of various skin changes has become common clinical practice in recent years.	1.0312790283219344
Due to its physical properties, the CO2 laser is particularly well suited for cutting and ablating tissue.	0.9783343543089739
The high absorption of its wavelength in water (=10600 nm) is responsible for its low penetration depth in biological tissue.	0.9072127318866349
Shortening the exposure time minimizes thermal side effects, such as carbonization and coagulation.	0.799179579949756
This effect can be lessened with the SilkTouch scanner, since the focussed laser beam is moved over a defined area by rapidly rotating mirrors.	0.9395914863155708
This enables a controlled and reliable removal of various dermal lesions.	0.8505319580467804
Particularly well-suited for treatment hypertrophic scars, post-acne scarring, perioral and periorbital wrinkles, rhinophymas and benign neoplasms including verruca vulgaris.	0.801449726234554
Cosmetically favorable reepithelialization of the treated skin surfaces occurs within a very short time after treatment.	0.8927375089620245
Periorbital resurfacing and correction of a rhinophyma are used as examples of dermal treatment with the CO2 laser and the SilkTouch scanner.	1.010598501533796
Acute spinal cord injury affects more than 3000 individuals per year with predominantly young people between 15 and 20 years of age being involved.	0.8950716192588029
Analysis of the modern emergency management has revealed that the prognosis of acute spinal trauma depends decisively on the initial treatment at the accident site as well as good acute emergency care.	1.1110779209316037
Therefore, there is the urgent need to brain the medical staff so that injuries are diagnosed correctly and appropriate treatment be performed.	1.2958058511434083
The first hours after the accident are decisive, because injuries due to the primary and especially secondary trauma are difficult to correct later.	1.154566825321256
Besides the fate of the individual patient, the care provider has to be aware of the high economic impact caused by intensive care, long lasting rehabilitation, as well as post rehabilitative care.	1.1119812463430057
Chronic or repeated stress can induce a damage of neurons, expecially in hippocampus, by which the degree of damage differs in various species.	0.954865646147175
Sapolski has reported that there is a correlation between hippocampal degeneration, disturbed feed-back reaction, and hypersecretion of glucocorticoids.	0.9391847600461531
The aim of this study was to investigate if the signal transmission via glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the brain of male wistar rats of two age groups (5-6 and 17-24 months, respectively) is changed in aging and which cytoplasmic factors/modulators participate in this process.	1.2062965575126614
Introduction: The treatment of soft tissue defects of the foot and ankle region remains a challenge, because special anatomical and physiological properties have to be considered.	1.1067254623678944
Patients and methods: The data of 52 patients, who were treated between 1994 and 1998, were analyzed.	1.1695797968581987
48 % were posttraumatic defects and were located in the weight bearing zone in 37 %.	1.132977136595405
Results: Fifty-nine procedures were used, including skin transplantation in 16 patients, local flaps in 3 cases, regional flaps in 14 cases, and microvascular procedures in 17 cases.	1.2774706061651089
Amputation was required in 4 patients.	0.7884004230019324
The overall success rate was 92 %.	0.5455712157158261
Complications occurred in 18 patients.	0.4316630221772633
Conclusions: Using these data and evaluation of the actual literature lead to the development of an algorithm for the treatment of defects in this area.	1.282089636035296
The modern armamentarium of plastic surgery offers the possible different treatment modalities.	0.7636695882344271
The conventional multichannel electroencephalogram is quite inconvenient for long-term monitoring in the operating theatre or intensive care unit.	0.8852691814093857
Recording of the EEG would be easier if a small number of channels was sufficient.	0.8272208977508921
Aiming at reduction of channels, leads from different regions of the scalp were analysed visually and with regard to their spectral content.	0.9955939836099155
APC resistance was first discovered in 1993.	0.6687773670532376
It is the most frequent cause of thrombophilia in Europe and North America.	0.960500317166146
In more than 90% of cases, the underlying cause of APC resistance is a single point mutation in the factor V gene.	1.0427426181867074
Heterozygous patients have a between five- and ten-fold higher risk of developing venous thrombosis, while in homozygous patients the risk is increased up to between 50- and 100-fold.	1.2806719079773017
Where there is a previous history of thrombosis, a careful investigation of the coagulation system, in particular a determination of the APC ratio, is recommended prior to surgery.	1.3247899920178614
In patients with APC resistance, a body-weight-specific thrombosis prophylaxis with heparin is recommended.	1.0909160647985765
Heterozygous patients only need anticoagulation when additional risk conditions are present, while homozygous patients with thromboembolic disease should be anticoagulated over a long period of time.	0.9594257263511212
Primary varicosis of the saphenous system should be treated promptly by surgery to minimize the additional risk of thrombotic complications.	0.9940045907216157
Pyomyositis is an acute bacterial infection with abscess formation in the skeletal muscles mostly due to Staphylococcus aureus.	0.8975591955348368
The disease is found more often in males.	1.0240011753796052
Since the patients symptoms and the clinical and laboratory findings are relatively unspecific, the clinical diagnosis of pyomyositis can present difficulties.	1.3873247535237878
Furthermore, cases of pyomyositis are rare in non-tropical countries and some physicians may not be familiar with it.	1.1770629720879733
If not diagnosed and treated properly, pyomyositis can lead to sepsis and death.	0.7819766581566125
Although the pathogenesis of the disease has not yet been clarified, some predisposing factors of forensic interest are well known: (trivial) trauma or vigorous exercise of the affected skeletal muscles, small potentially "septic" foci in other tissues or internal organs and a preexisting immunodeficiency, e. g. in diabetes mellitus, intravenous drug abusers or individuals suffering from HIV.	1.173774997618351
Three cases of "non-tropical" pyomyositis with fatal outcome are presented and the literature on the subject is reviewed with special reference to epidemiological and etiological factors, taking forensic aspects, histomorphologic findings and the problems of post-mortem diagnosis of pyomyositis into consideration.	1.1613371135142305
Aim of the study: The etiology of persistent crying during early infancy has been only insufficiently elucidated.	0.9410503801480216
Based upon recent data from the "Munich Interdisciplinary Research and Intervention Program (MIRIP)", this paper shall discuss and challenge well known explanatory models.	1.142883317730188
In addition, novel approaches of intervention shall be presented.	1.0026549784408028
Because tumour cell invasion is a three-dimensional process involving tumour cells as well as stromal cells, tumour invasion models should include equivalents of both compartments in a spatially defined organisation.	0.9735522946459613
Aims: Evaluation of differentiation and invasive potential in relation to basement membrane (BM) formation of new human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines under the influence of fibromatosis fibroblasts in a 3D co-culture system (collagen type I/fibroblast-containing matrix).	0.9356742365945421
Material and methods: OSCC cell lines were established and cultured on collagen type I matrix with and without the inclusion of fibro-/myofibroblasts derived from nodular palmar fibromatosis).	0.94511454072259
Evaluation of invasion was done by conventional H & E staining after paraffin embedding; immunohistochemistry was performed for cytokeratins (MNF 116), involucrin (Sy5), vimentin (V9), collagen type IV (CIV22), laminin (1-chain, 4C7), and Ki-67 (MIB1); and electron microscopy followed.	1.2586390454981158
Results: The OSCC cell lines PE/CA-PJ15, PE/CA-PJ34, PE/CA-PJ41 were invasive exclusively on gels containing fibroblasts with stratification of the multilayerd OSCC cell coat and polarised expression of cytokeratin and involucrin.	0.8410299451216208
There was no evidence for BM, either by immunohistochemistry or by electron microscopy, although OSCC are immunohistochemically positive for collagen type IV and laminin in the 2D cell culture.	1.064193507314326
There were no differences in proliferative activity of the gels with and without fibroblasts.	0.8951251667342436
Conclusions: Carcinoma cell invasion depends on the presence of fibroblasts in the gel indicating the important role of tumor stromal fibro-/myofibroblasts during carcinomic invasion.	1.0886506257075805
The absence of a BM does not, per se, imply an invasive tumour growth.	0.8713079216119619
Moreover, stratification and terminanl differentiation of epithelial tumour cells occur independently of a structural BM.	1.0379725776491169
Interfragmentary movement and size of the fracture gap influence fracture healing.	0.9833159188568817
Limited movements promote callus formation and may result in increased mechanical stability.	0.8204598008934537
Although larger movements still promote callus formation, the bony consolidation of the fracture is hampered.	1.121563265011085
Fracture healing is also hampered if the size of the fracture gap is too large.	1.0006140348025379
A combination of large movement and large gap bears the risk of non-union.	0.8604850188181583
Therefore, having in mind a minimally invasive surgical approach, one should strive for good reduction of the fracture ends and flexible yet stable osteosynthesis.	1.2247891743191797
Dynamization of the fracture by enabling axial movement will close the fracture gap, stimulate tissue differentiation and possibly accelerate the healing process.	0.9695562000325431
External mechanical stimulation, however, has not been shown to effectively enhance the healing process under flexible fixation or in load-bearing patients.	1.1336525441519911
Although ketamine has been in clinical use for 3 decades, the neuropharmacological basis of its analgesic, anaesthetic, sympathomimetic, and psychotomimetic effects is still a subject of controversial discussion and intensive investigational efforts.	1.0875226882541575
In recent years, however, new experimental approaches to its effects on the cellular and molecular level and the availability of pure ketamine enantiomers contributed substantially to the understanding of its complex neuropharmacology.	1.0438552310727673
This article reviews the current knowledge of ketamine effects on ligand-operated and voltage-operated transmembrane ion channels, G-protein-coupled receptors, transmitter uptake, and the NO-cGMP system in neurons.	1.0625786243019542
With regard to its potential clinical relevance and supposed relative role among the complex mechanisms involved in pain perception, analgesia, anaesthesia, and psychotomimesis, the contributions of recent experimental and clinical findings to the identification of major target sites of ketamine are summarised.	1.086151665671302
In contrast to the uncertainty surrounding the potential role of opioid receptors, there is now considerable evidence that NMDA antagonism is a central mechanism that contributes to the amnesic, analgesic, anaesthetic, and psychotomimetic as well as the neuroprotective actions of ketamine.	1.1892032799938685
Moreover, the involvement of non-NMDA glutamate receptors, muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic transmission, interactions with 5-HT receptors, and L-Type Ca2+ channels may account for some of its anaesthetic and neuroprotective properties.	1.004591497342333
There is undoubtedly a need for a safe disinfection method of optical instruments used by ENT specialists.	0.9693176691364338
So far, a standard method that sufficiently covers the risk of infection for patients and medical staff alike while serving the need of practicability in daily routine has not been established.	1.1884365103458194
Therefore, in the ENT departments of the hospitals of Mannheim, Kaiserslautern, and Tübingen, studies on the disinfection of rigid optical instruments without working channel were performed between February 1999 and May 1999.	1.2201958177622723
Instruments were wiped either with an aldehyde or alcohol (ethanol 80%) and germs were detected by quantitative swab cultures.	0.9491888466282178
As discussed in the article, disinfection with ethanol proved to be at least equally efficient if not better than disinfection with aldehyde.	0.9566436347767988
Therefore, it fully serves the requirements of a safe method for disinfection optical instruments without working channels.	1.103881802115756
White piedra is a rare hair infection of man and certain animals, caused by the widespread Trichosporon fungi.	0.9717366832567519
The infection is characterized clinically by whitish, soft and easily removable coating of the hair shafts; however, the shafts may be destroyed by the pathogens invading at localized points.	0.9956727247636198
While all body hair may be affected, the pubic hair is most frequently affected.	1.0090853105592767
This paper is the first report genital white piedra in a 34-year-old Central European man.	1.104596616519812
In all, 22 cases have been described world-wide in young men ranging in age from 20 to 40 years.	1.0405239957831485
Only 2 men, aged 42 and 53 years, do not fall in this range.	0.891582488900793
Recently, a major African study disclosed this disease in women for the first time.	1.0775500762992847
In moderate latitudes, however, this infection appears to occur almost exclusively in young men.	1.030079814139984
In open fractures the rate of infected non-union defects has in recent years decreased due to the increased primary application of external fixation.	1.037316085789483
In spite of this positive state of affairs the condition is still encountered often enough to warrant specific treatment strategies and techniques.	0.9832464818646826
In the treatment of infected pseudarthroses the general principles of osteitis treatment are applied.	0.8772138081232798
This includes radical excision of infected pseudarthrotic bone and of the diseased surrounding soft tissue, provides mechanical stability in the non-union area and requires effective local treatment of the infection in combination with systemic, target-specific and temporary well-defined antibiotic therapy as well as procedures to improve local circulation.	1.1239754673414921
The incorporation of autogenous bone transplants in defects appears to depend on close contact between the transplant and the vascularized receiving site and on the quantity of the transplanted osseous material.	0.9530132292219345
A promising alternative method of dealing with extensive bone defects is osteogenesis produced by callus distraction; therefore special attention is given to Ilizarov's ring fixation system.	0.936431920765147
Unstable scar formation demands local muscular flaps or microvascularized free flap transfer, which seems to be superior to other methods.	0.9583549834250624
Aim of the study: Using phantom studies, a dedicated low-field MR system with 0.2 T and a whole-body MR-scanner with 1.0 T were compared.	1.2574021111104756
Many different mechanisms contribute to the etiopathogenesis of the so-called diabetic foot syndrome.	0.882382135016774
Among chronic complications, the diabetic foot syndrome is one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization.	1.0141265704584042
The relative risk of diabetic patients requiring an amputation is up to 45 times greater than in normal subjects.	0.8485880597857909
Sensory neuropathy, ischemia, and infection are the principal pathogenetic factors in the diabetic foot syndrome.	0.8672898392889594
In most cases, a painless trauma is the initial condition that leads to an ulcer.	0.9848355699117497
In this article, an overview of the different causes, clinical manifestations, and treatment options for a multidisciplinary team are discussed.	1.2396549108026196
Lung resection offers the best prospect of long-term survival in patients with nonmetastatic pulmonary neoplasia.	0.9200595302601643
In view of the dismal prognosis of unresected bronchial cancer, surgical resection should be encouraged even in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary function.	0.9973585643471138
Accurate estimation of the postoperative cardiopulmonary function is therefore desirable to avoid (a) refusal of potentially curative treatment and (b) severe postoperative disability.	1.0167202124651387
The origins of postresection morbidity and mortality are multifactorial.	0.8767150348889838
Thus, no single pulmonary function test or hemodynamic measurement can accurately and reliably predict postoperative cardiorespiratory complications.	1.1133963345555025
Criteria of functional operability should be based on percent of predicted value, so that patient's age, sex, and height will be taken into consideration.	0.9883268381598161
Exercise testing offers the advantage that both pulmonary and cardiac risk can be evaluated simultaneously.	0.9171445179476623
The high predictive value of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) in assessing postoperative morbidity and mortality is established.	1.0761956983212302
The calculation of predicted postoperative lung function (ppo) is of importance.	0.9900936167992158
The postoperative values for the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1-ppo), the transfer factor (TL,CO-ppo), and VO2max-ppo can be predicted by using the same formula.	1.0326090090585376
Patients with nearly normal lung function (FEV1, TL,CO > 75 % predicted) and no concomitant cardiac disease can undergo lung resection right up to pneumonectomy without further diagnostic procedures.	1.11520963425497
In the others, FEV1-ppo and TL,CO-ppo should be estimated first by taking into account the number of segments to be resected.	0.8574830479092745
Patients with values < 30 % predicted are usually regarded as being inoperable, whereas values > 40 % predicted qualify for resection without the need for further diagnostics.	1.2554635779411243
VO2max < 10 ml/kg/min or < 40 % predicted are prohibitive for surgery.	1.1676946682133789
If VO2max is > 20 ml/kg/min or > 75 % predicted, functional operability without limitation is given.	1.137012994914522
For those cases where diagnostic uncertainty still remains, FEV1-ppo, TL,CO-ppo, and VO2max-ppo can be calculated by means of quantitative lung scans.	0.849195253284046
Patients with either FEV1-ppo and TL,CO-ppo < 30 % predicted or VO2max-ppo < 8 ml/kg/min or < 35 % predicted are deemed inoperable.	1.1237613245008988
The treatment of acute of Achilles tendon rupture experienced a dynamic development in the last ten years.	1.0974674328470568
Decisive for this development was the application of MRI and above all the ultrasonography in the diagnostics of the pathological changes and injuries of tendons.	1.0724560707278816
The question of ruptue morphology as well as different courses of healing could be now evaluated objectively.	0.8759902127725746
These advances led consequently to new modalities in treatment concepts and rehabilitation protocols.	0.8682560565605449
The decisive input for improvements of the outcome results and particularly the shortening of the rehabilitation period came with introduction of the early functional treatment in contrast to immobilizing plaster treatment.	1.122631549240269
In a prospective randomized study (1987-1989) at the Trauma Dept.	1.1416943267897668
of the Hannover Medical School could show no statistical differences comparing functional non-operative with functional operative therapy with a special therapy boot (Variostabil/Adidas).	0.9773635528865636
The crucial criteria for therapy selection results from the sonografically measured position of the tendon stumps in plantar flexion (20  °).	1.0191536427068613
With complete adaptation of the tendons' ends surgical treatment does not achieve better results than non-operative functional treatment in term of tendon healing and functional outcome.	0.9252892274898876
Regarding the current therapeutic standards each method has is advantages and disadvantages.	0.8709422510623127
Both, the operative and non-operative functional treatment enable a stable tendon healing with a low risk of rerupture (1-2 %).	1.1504581219720598
Meanwhile there is consensus for early functional aftertreatment of the operated Achilles' tendons.	0.8587965965292103
There seems to be a trend towards non-operative functional treatment in cases of adaquate sonografical findings, or to minimal invasive surgical techniques.	1.100444140783235
Based on a case report, we offer brief guidelines on the perioperative management of patients with Sleep-Apnea-Syndrome (SAS) who present with a high incidence of a difficult airway and a high risk of respiratory depression during the perioperative period.	1.1906069206539853
A 39 year old male patient with a body mass index of 34,22 kg/m2 and receiving continuous-positive-airway-pressure- (CPAP) therapy for known SAS was scheduled for elective plastic surgery.	1.1620896979113138
After induction of anaesthesia and direct laryngoscopy no adequate airway could be established and the patient became hypoxic, hypercapnic and developed hypotension and bradycardia.	1.0327044834327914
With the use of a laryngeal mask airway the patient was stabilized and did not show neurologic sequale after immediate awakening.	1.0323513631161019
The following fiberoptic intubation of the awake patient, still showing tendency of upper airway obstruction, confirmed the difficult anatomical structures.	0.9431744962730572
The subsequent general anesthesia was uneventful.	0.6347875588834564
The patient received CPAP therapy and was monitored during the first postoperative night in the Intensive Care Unit.	1.0183893316082742
He made an uneventful recovery.	0.5703653833095059
He was advised to have regional anaesthesia or planned fiberoptic intubation, where possible, in the case of further anesthetic intervention.	1.079981387269783
SAS has major implications for the anaesthesiologist and whenever patients exhibiting the high risk factors (obesity, male sex, history of intense snoring, impaired daytime performance, nonrefreshing daytime naps) are presented for surgery this condition should be considered.	1.0498561519128364
Elective surgery should be postponed until after adequate examination and treatment when necessary.	0.8354431591919826
Patients with SAS should always be suspected of having cardiopulmonary dysfunctions such as hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmia or cor pulmonale.	0.8780323916220908
It is most important to avoid sedative premedication, to initiate CPAP therapy preoperatively, to encourage regional anaesthesia if possible and to ensure close monitoring over the complete perioperative period.	1.1426116625958873
Planned fiberoptic intubation, preferably with surgical personnel available for an emergency airway, is a safe method for the induction of anaesthesia.	1.0928369101080249
Postoperatively, patients are at high risk from respiratory depression, even in the awake state.	1.1322630581131543
Postoperative opioid analgesia, no matter what route, should only be given under close monitoring.	1.1136867673590352
Independently of regional or general anaesthesia there is an increased risk of respiratory depression in the middle of the first postoperative week, suspected to be caused by the catching up on lost REM-sleep, due to shifts in the normal sleep pattern during the first postoperative days.	1.1661005921578698
Life style measures (weight reduction and control, reduction of total fat calories to <30% of total calories, modification of fat intake to increased monounsaturated vegetable fat, increased intake of dietary fibers, increased physical activity, controlled stress relaxation) are the basis of longterm therapy of coronary heart disease.	1.1715144035222498
For transformation to daily life both patient and doctor need motivation, information, patience, and realistic aimes.	0.9633360744528692
For realization the 10 rules of medical information should be followed.	0.8873267646579875
The patient must be informed that the "new lifestyle" is not punishing but means a new quality of life.	1.092092050441191
With respect to the most important metabolic syndrome with hyperinsulinemia due to insulin resistance, weight reduction is the most important measure for preventing complications of atherosclerosis.	1.163498701139202
The patient should use a diary for weight control and blood pressure selfmeasurement.	0.8949626860201729
IOL implantation in childhood is still controversial.	0.6874028718972041
Background: Increases in serum calcium are often detected by chance.	1.224852988945222
They warrant a prompt diagnostic work-up to identify the underlying cause.	1.0346219070690656
In the present review we describe our experience with debridement in necrotizing pancreatitis, with particular emphasis on the indications for surgery and the outcome in patients with infected and sterile necrosis.	1.3737445397144423
Within 7 years 64 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis underwent surgery with a median preoperative APACHE II score of 9.	1.0033193316421838
The indications for surgery were either proven infection or persistence of symptoms.	0.8628404238159116
Thirty-six patients were found to have infected necrosis, while 28 patients had sterile necrosis.	1.1215283883603147
There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding pre- and postoperative parameters.	1.0851795478423547
The surgical technique involved a blunt necrosectomy followed by closed packing with Penrose drains.	0.849938368633133
This technique produced the lowest reported mortality of 6.2 % with a reoperation rate of only 17 %, demonstrating that even with sterile necrosis surgical management can be carried out safely.	1.2212447309786838
The incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction (MI) is proportional to the incidence of myocardial ischaemic episodes.	1.0664795400630944
Therefore, the prevention of such episodes is of great clinical importance.	1.1679717135156817
The absorption of large volumes of irrigation fluid is a major problem in transurethral prostatic surgery (TUR-P).	0.890645631155823
Various indicators have been tested to monitor fluid absorption with regard to continuous registration and sufficient accuracy.	0.8978649308553899
The volumetric fluid balance is not suitable as a routine method because of its inaccuracy.	0.9720284642455392
Easily accessible parameters are unspecific because of surgical bleeding (haematocrit [Hct]), or are interfered with by physiological counter-regulatory actions (serum sodium [Na] concentration).	0.9629768504768405
In 1986 Hulten et al.	0.4566999557294927
suggested adding 2% ethanol to the irrigation fluid as a marker and investigated it intermittently in the expired air with an alcohol-test appliance.	1.0308964755076626
In a prospective clinical study of 17 patients undergoing TUR-P under spinal anaesthesia, expiratory concentrations of alcohol that was added to the irrigation fluid (2% ethanol in Purisole, Fresenius, Bad Homburg) were monitored.	1.236219545561746
Gas was continuously sampled from the nasopharynx through a nasal cannula and the ethanol concentration was measured using a modified diverting anaesthetic gas monitor (Normac, Datex, Helsinki) that allows continuous as well as early detection of the absorbed irrigation fluid with reliable accuracy for clinical use.	0.9970267715267601
In addition, at intervals of 10 minutes we measured blood alcohol, endtidal alcohol (Alcotest 7110, Drauml;ger, Lübeck), haematocrit, serum Na concentration, and blood gases.	1.1727600746827325
Sixty-eight measurements were obtained from the 17 patients.	0.8285783501105016
As shown in other studies, serum Na (r2 = 0.68) and Hct (r2 = 0.39) correlated poorly with the irrigation fluid as determined by serum alcohol levels.	0.9472306970440976
In contrast, the expiratory alcohol measurements with the alcotest 7110 (r2 = 0.93) and Normac devices (r2 = 0.85) were closely related.	1.0313482129662506
Continuous monitoring of the expiratory alcohol concentration with a Normac monitor closely reflects blood alcohol concentrations, and may hence serve as a useful semiquantitative monitor of irrigation fluid absorption during TUR-P.	0.9710281892596693
Between 1986 and 1996, 21 patients had a tibiocalcanear arthrodesis.	0.9131294692098587
Indications for surgery were in all cases either osteomyelitis or avascular necrosis of the talus.	1.0756312922468323
External stabilisation was used in 17 patients due to severe soft tissue damage or extensive infection of the talus, internal screw fixation was used in four patients.	1.1795750032815124
There were eight complications in seven patients, one patient had a below the knee amputation.	1.128396900452981
The leg length discrepancies after resection of the talus was equalised in four cases with callus distraction using an Ilisarov ring fixator.	1.0334273553688111
Follow up evaluation was available in 18 patients after an average of 38 months (12-86 mo.).	1.0708654049231958
There were no infectious recurrenies during the follow up period and a solid fusion was achieved in all patients that were followed.	1.3644096084433122
According to a modified Kitaoka score, results were excellent and good in 12 of the 18patients.	1.1218400558577595
External stabilisation, especially the Ilisarov ring fixator is the primary method of treatment in cases with severe infection or soft tissue damage.	1.2980435211266985
Intraoperative autotransfusion (MAT), preoperative autologous blood donation, and preoperative normovolaemic haemodilution are three different methods to avoid homologous blood transfusion during surgical procedures.	1.1321727125798229
The controversial use of MAT via cell saver in tumour surgery as well as contamination of the operative field with urine illustrate the particular difficulties of autologous blood transfusion in connection with radical prostatectomy.	0.946703671482997
We investigated changes in the osmotic resistance of the retransfused red blood cells (RBC), bacterial contamination, changes in coagulation parameters, and the presence of tumour cells.	1.1385407347963485
Orbital pseudotumor is a nonspecific inflammatory process of unknown etiology that can be divided histopathologically into three basic types: granulomatous, lymphoid, and sclerosing.	1.1231134856260157
Between 1995 and 1998, 12 patients with pseudotumor orbitae were treated in the ENT Department of the University of Saarland.	0.9881946220117281
Histopathological examination showed granulomatous type of pseudotumor in six, lymphoid in three, and sclerosing in three patients.	1.1320905646107642
In seven cases the pseudotumor orbitae were medially located and in four cases laterally.	0.828568145331528
In one patient nearly all orbital structures were infiltrated.	0.8876800098315589
A number of different mapping systems have been published for the lymph-node staging in lung cancer.	0.9471556123400833
The use of a reproducible map is an essential prerequisite for correct determination of the TNM status and comparing the surgical results.	1.1462401924925674
In order to evaluate the current status of lymph-node mapping and lymph-node dissection in Germany, we performed a mail survey involving 90 hospitals performing operations for lung cancer.	1.01680260516868
Responses were obtained from 61 (67.7 %) hospitals.	1.202829474391852
Currently, the majority of the departments (43 %) use the German staging system (according to the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Thorax-, Herz- und Gefäßchirurgie/Pneumologie), 23 % lymph-node mapping according to Naruke, and 25 % an individual description of the resected lymph nodes.	1.3842610852693567
The number of resected lymph nodes is reported in 75 % of the departments, the quotient of involved/not involved lymph nodes in 33 %.	1.233205724542056
Mediastinal lymph-node sampling guided by the intraoperative aspect of lymph nodes is performed in 59 % of the departments.	1.2151841783452009
A systematic mediastinal "en-bloc" resection is accomplished in 41 %.	0.871798462026329
The results of this survey represent the current status of lymph-node mapping and lymphadenectomy in lung cancer in Germany and might be useful for the development of a uniform staging system.	1.1016810938010164
In a 4-year period two right-sided empyemas occurred following a total of 39 pneumonectomies for lung cancer.	1.0411990746462805
In another case pneumonectomy was performed for left-sided lung cancer with concomitant empyema as an emergency procedure in a patient referred from an outside hospital.	1.1335901563581976
Empyema was treated with repeated thoracoscopic debridements and intermittent lavage with polyvinylpyrrolidine-iodine solution and streptocinase/streptodornase.	0.7699071977189577
Three to seven thoracoscopies were required to sterilize the pleural cavity.	0.6821589224785906
After a median follow-up of 14 months all three patients are well and without any evidence of infection.	1.1371231930326249
VATS is suitable for definitive treatment of postpneumonectomy empyema and is associated with excellent functional and cosmetic results.	0.7906513146376087
Injuries to the spine and the spinal cord are an important problem.	0.9200588861176602
In the present paper the application of external transpedicular fixation of the spinal column for surgical treatment of patients in the acute phase of spinal cord injuries is described.	1.3623098644527263
The results of treatment obtained in 54 patients in the acute phase are presented.	1.0913992794487613
Decompression of the spinal cord can be accomplished by way of a dorsal approach.	0.8947979145757118
In this way it is possible to remove the compressing factor in stages.	1.182913090333047
Positive results were achieved in the late phase in 84.22% of patients with acute spinal and spinal cord injuries.	1.20189874994445
Objectives: Children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) show retarded growth.	1.014931129847883
The question arose as to whether proportionate catch-up growth follows.	0.7754958421752269
Background: The fundus autofluorescence imaging technique has been modified allowing improved image resolution (768 x 572 pixel).	0.8750640145942765
We present results of fundus autofluorescence studies using this technique.	0.6891335716630308
Certain intra-articular fractures of the knee can be managed by arthroscopically assisted reduction and  fixation.	0.9380991920403411
The known benefits of arthroscopy include better visualization of the entire joint, limited dissection, and thorough irrigation.	1.0793982363924135
The purpose of this paper is to present our experience with arthroscopically assisted reduction and fixation of certain intra-articular fractures of the knee.	0.9891580998054483
From May 1995 to November 1997, 34 patients with intra-articular fractures of the knee were treated by arthroscopic reduction and fixation.	1.0763420318302577
We treated 11 patients with tibial plateau fracture type I, II and III (according to J. Schatzker classification), 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the tibial insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament (intercondylar eminence) type II, III and IV (according to Meyers, McKeever and Zariczny classification), two patients with completely dislocated osteochondral flake fractures of the femoral condyle, and one patient with a minimally displaced fracture of the patella.	1.1765518409813542
Postoperatively they were all allowed passive motion exercises.	0.7179518879522013
Patients with avulsion fractures of the ACL and the patient with fracture of the patella were allowed immediate weight bearing, while patients with tibial plateau fractures and osteochondral fractures were allowed weight bearing only after 12 weeks.	1.2171123778216977
Results: Of the 11 tibial plateau fractures, 8 were anatomically reduced, and in 2 the dislocation was less than 2 mm.	1.42796124576826
No further dislocation of the fragment followed.	0.8401180969042502
All patients but one reported stable knees and they all had a full range of motion at follow-up.	0.8209118554776492
Of the 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the anterior cruciate ligament, 19 were anatomically reduced.	0.8058445976259383
Except in one patient, functional results were excellent (KT1000 was 1.3 mm, average loss of flexion was 2.5 °, loss of extension was 1.3 °).	1.1916388316602144
In two cases of osteochondral fractures of the femoral condyle, reduction was anatomical.	1.302121700835569
The fractures healed, the patients were free of pain and had full ROM at the follow-up.	1.0531982580470405
The fracture of the patella healed in 4 weeks with full ROM of the knee.	0.9328912770742078
There was one case of aseptic synovitis and no other major complications.	1.1136611601201243
Conclusions: Arthroscopic reduction and fixation are technically possible in certain types of intra-articular fractures of the knee.	1.0082692538867517
Provided indications are good, results of arthroscopic treatment are better than in classical surgical treatment through arthrotomy.	1.0440433920969405
There is less postoperative morbidity, and hospitalization and total rehabilitation times are shorter.	1.0250646223054185
Some technical hints are presented.	0.5027320073650977
A healthy 38-year-old woman suffered a sudden cardiac arrest 2 days after a vaginal hysterectomy.	1.0717793407441802
Although standard cardiac life support (CPR) was instituted immediately after the event, it was not possible to re-establish a spontaneous circulation for about 40 min.	1.0657538916737277
Systemic intravenous thrombolytic therapy with slow injection of 1.5 million IU urokinase was performed as a final life-maintaining measure because of the high probability that the underlying cause was a pulmonary embolus; 10 min later (after 60 min of ongoing CPR) the patient regained a stable circulation.	1.3055238873460668
She survived without neurological deficit in spite of the long duration of CPR.	1.1876961478199632
In 348 patients with an initial diagnosis of rectal carcinoma operated on between 1985 and 1994 we investigated the quality of lymph node dissection, its influence on the perioperative risk and tumor staging.	1.2596259882730498
The same histopathological work-up was carried out in all cases.	1.0287009983462494
Whether resections or extirpations were performed, the number of dissected lymph nodes increased from 5.3 and (1985/1986) to 16.7 and 17.3 (1991/1992) and to 15.8 and 17.3 (1993/1994) respectively.	1.324020688738515
Neither the type of operation nor the surgeon's experience had a significant influence on the number of lymph nodes dissected.	0.937596882298874
The increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected had no negative effect on the length of the operation, the amount of blood infused during the operation or the perioperative risk.	1.0598262906015117
We found a significant correlation between the number of lymph nodes dissected and the number of lymph node metastases (P = 0.02) and between an increase in UICC stage III (P = 0.005) and pN2 tumors (P = 0.000) and an increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected.	1.1332507354881987
Central lymph node dissection by high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery did not increase the perioperative risk in spite of the fact that in recent years we have observed more patients with multiple diseases.	1.2818073741622666
With the institution of the Protection against infection Act, case definitions will be officially introduced for the routine transmission of notifiable infectious diseases from local health departments to state and national health institutions in Germany for the first time.	0.889083492399661
Case definitions link the disease entity with a defined description of the disease.	0.8518559536629073
The abstraction thereby required leads to the creation of nosological entities.	0.700836081574717
The case definitions, which were developed by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) according to the Protection against infection Act, enable the local health departments to assess and categorise reported cases, deaths and laboratory reports of pathogens according to uniform criteria prior to transmission to the RKI via the state health institutions.The quality of surveillance data will be significantly improved, as each reported case/infection will fulfil defined criteria, thereby enabling unclear cases/diagnoses to be separated from those that are confirmed.	1.0535364068984172
Endosseous osseointegrated implants have become an integral part of the treatment scheme for the prosthetic reconstruction and rehabilitation of masticatory function following scientific studies of the reactions between implant and soft and hard tissues.	1.0505643968273133
Furthermore, implants offer good chances for prosthetic rehabilitation in the insufficient bone site, if the extremely atrophic jaw is to be reconstructed by grafting procedures with avascular and vascular grafts, by guided bone regeneration, by distraction osteogenesis, by bone substitutes and in the future by osteoinductive proteins in order to prepare the conditions for implant insertion.	1.2370299761115655
Those reconstruction procedures combined with implants become often necessary, if  complicated hard and soft tissue defects of the skull have to be reconstructed to create the prerequisites for the stabilisation of epitheses or to insert implant-supported devices.	1.0428866846622207
A 58-year-old woman was initially externally diagnosed in 1983 with a presacral mass, which was subsequently treated as an abcess.	1.149468252234901
Thereafter, the patient experienced recurrent perianal fistulas.	1.306567330944935
Further diagnostic studies revealed a cystic tumor, considered to be an epidermoid cyst, which was located in the inferior pelvis and was consequently removed.	1.1611252182743363
Histologically, cystic scar tissue was found with a highly differentiated adenocarcinoma which measured 4 cm.	1.0849701024676568
Later on, the patient again experienced perianal fistulas originating from a renewed presacral mass.	1.0609707864231948
As a result, an abdominal-perianal rectum extirpation and a partial resection of the sacrum with placement of a descendostomy were done.	0.9794447187628893
Histologically, adenocarcinoma tissue was found at the base of a tail-gut cyst.	1.0636984227622304
One year following her operation, the patient is free from any complaints and relapses.	1.187259236306979
The tail-gut cyst is a very rare entity which arises from the inadequate involution of the tail-gut during embryonal development.	0.8820722901694152
A malignant transformation occurs in 10 % of the cases.	0.8077463893412495
In the case of recurrent perianal fistulas and cystic masses between the rectum and os sacrum or os coccygeum, a tail-gut cyst should be taken into consideration, the goal being its complete removal.	1.0819606564768212
The German Social Law has required quality assurance (QA) procedures since 1989.	0.8946707878487993
The measures must be suitable to allow "comparing investigations".	0.8200828733894968
In 1992 the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine published recommendations for QA in anaesthesia: most problems during an anaesthetic should be documented in a standardised manner, and thus, a list of 63 pitfalls, events, and complications (PECs) and five degrees of severity were defined.	1.182319435976539
The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of PECs in anaesthesia and to correlate PECs with procedures and preoperative health status.	0.9324358261524511
Using the diary method, the correlation between daily mood and everyday activities is analyzed.	0.9045721915459922
Positive and negative affect were used as indicator of daily mood.	0.8089812792784677
Duration of social activities and resting during the day were used as indicator of daily activities.	0.8972162576387631
A total of 55 elderly persons kept a activity and mood diary for at least 50 days.	0.9228025191091235
The data were analyzed interindividually (using regression analyses) and intraindividually (using time series analyses).	1.1998595768289895
While positive affect and duration of social activities correlate positively in both inter- and intraindividual perspective, there is a relationship between negative affect and duration of rest only in interindividual perspective.	0.9922021101500769
Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.	1.0647573509777621
Purpose: Regional hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy or/and radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-seated tumors.	1.1110873843958675
The purpose of the project is the optimization of the therapy using non-invasive, three-dimensional imaging of tissue changes or of the temperature distribution during regional hyperthermia.	1.160792034796399
The purpose of the Transfusion Law, which came into force on 7 July 1998, is to ensure the supply with safe blood products, to reinforce the confidence in the blood transfusion system, and to support self sufficiency with blood and plasma.	1.2482295117893099
In order to reach this goal, the law regulates the essential reqirements for the adequate collection of blood and blood constituents, as well for safe usage of blood products.	1.2037124875006544
Moreover it lays down rules for look-back procedures, prescribes the collection of data on the epidemiology in donor populations, creates a legal basis for the advisory group 'Arbeitskreis Blut', and fosters the self sufficiency with blood and plasma by several prescriptions.	0.9005461355491946
In the last decades back pain has reached dramatic proportions in industrialized countries.	0.9657539743785145
Disorders of the back are nowadays the leading cause of direct and indirect health care costs.	0.7706845832566832
Accurate prevalence estimates are needed to serve as a basis for health care evaluations.	0.8274616104391421
A review of epidemiologic studies in the general population reveals that back pain has reached a prevalence of 40 % for current pain.	1.2252334864189414
7 to 18 % are "frequently", "often", "daily" or "constantly" affected.	1.3628551586321471
75 % of the adult population suffers from back pain during the last year.	1.0642887008415283
80 to 90 % of the adult population in industrialized countries experience back pain ever.	1.038151562344607
Gender specific differences are only present in severe, chronic forms which are more often experienced by women.	1.0350367583029114
Back pain has a prevalence maximum at 50 to 64 years.	0.8655394267007166
Older persons display lower prevalence estimates.	0.5394721138472194
The prevalence maximum in men is one decade earlier than in women.	0.7882582115789857
There are several potential explanations for this prevalence pattern that are discussed in the article.	1.0202188728164432
Back pain can be classified by location, temporal characteristics, pain intensity and pain history.	0.9401986040386304
Currently, for none of these dimensions generally accepted, uniformly employed and validated definitions are available.	1.1417067182908798
In most of the industrialized countries back pain is one of the most expensive symptoms.	1.0490190571037432
75-90 % of the direct and indirect health care costs were caused by those 5-10 % of patients who are disabled.	1.2740228999689687
As predictors of back pain a history of back pain and job satisfaction play by far a more important role than the extensively studied mechanical factors.	0.885025892985997
For a first episode of back pain the prognosis is favorable.	0.8581533541897914
If the pain persist for more than three months the prognosis is unfavorable.	0.9906528137138817
After six months of absenteeism because of back pain more than half of the afflicted never return to work.	0.8352412269285814
Rarely back pain is present as a single symptom.	1.0123855076138608
In more than 80 % back pain is associated with pain in at least one joint.	1.1847882885647802
It remains to be studied if back pain may be viewed as an entity or as part of a more complex pain syndrome.	0.9957948198385833
Chronic low back pain can be considered to be one of the most frequently treated and most costly diseases in modern industrial societies.	0.9953400846173742
Dysfunctions and imbalances of the spine-supporting muscles increase the risk of low back pain.	0.8143704802701857
Consequently preventive treatment and rehabilitation have to aim at preserving and restoring the full capacity of the spine-supporting muscles as well as training coordination and spine-friendly behaviour.	0.9426757397327556
In addition to various measures of pain therapy, physiotherapeutic treatment including neuro-physiotherapy, physical treatment (eg electrotherapy), balneotherapy and supportive behavioural training, medical rehabilitation therapy (MRT) ranks among the most effective ways of treating low back pain.	1.1053450519611123
MRT applies guidelines and methods of exercise methodology within medically indicated programmes of preventive treatment and rehabilitation.	0.7975636728694133
Various objectives of MRT are outlined with special regard to the stages of MRT treatment, emphasizing positive adaptation of the neuro-muscular system in the course of rehabilitation.	0.9243189547535214
Physicians are responsible for MRT diagnosis and control.	0.7000699049946086
Taking into account the base disorder and the progress of therapy physiotherapists and the physicians in charge determine MRT objectives and treatment strategies.	0.9838420890361751
A 39-year-old female patient presented with an intense allergic reaction and shock after ingesting sunflower seeds and simultaneously acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).	0.7866395635247099
Skin tests and CAP specific.	0.5896699986521181
IgE demonstrated an IgE-mediated sensibilization to sunflower seeds.	0.6845192820594391
When sunflower seeds were eaten alone, only discrete paresthesias of the oral mucosa occurred.	0.99511387030646
Surprisingly, an oral challenge with ASA was well tolerated.	1.052814351323619
The supplementary centribution of ASA to the allergic reaction was done-dependent.	0.8245327361823733
The quantity of the allergen also modified the intensity of the symptoms.	0.8135972375441803
This surprising effect of ASA may be attributed to increased gastric resorption of the allergens.	0.8306322762358266
During the course of this reaction, eosinophil-cationic-protein was released.	0.764672078047858
Axillary lymph node dissection for node sampling is one of the most important staging procedures when mammary carcinoma is treated surgically.	0.9719364984062439
Periprosthetic femoral fractures present the problem of fracture treatment and prosthetic stability.	0.9541287212867885
Various treatment options are recommended for managing these fractures.	0.8509807784847379
We treated 51 patients with 54 periprosthetic fractures between 1985 and 1995.	0.7211450157328166
Of these, 42 (78 %) fractures were treated with a plate, eight (14 %), with a revision prosthesis, two (4 %), with retrograde nailing, and two (4 %), conservatively due to poor medical condition.	1.346111305324026
The choice of fracture management was dependent on the type and location of the fracture and on the stability of the prosthesis.	1.1903728882727456
A total of 50 fractures healed primarily.	0.9180288498194211
Complications included three cases of plate loosening, one further fracture, one deep infection, one broken bolt and one varus deformity.	1.118669465869231
Four patients died in the postoperative period, an additional 19 were dead at the time of the evaluation.	1.091236149928838
Fractures with a stable implant can be treated with plate fixation.	1.0199156978390322
Cases of a loose implant require revision.	0.787743718230099
Distal fractures are stabilized with a plate or with a retrograde nail.	0.9283256504874046
A young patient who underwent renewed aortic valve replacement after already open blasting of the aortic valve and following valve replacement with enlargement of the ascending thoracic aorty by using a pericardium patch had taken place is reported.	1.010222688554148
In the area of this enlargement by the pericardium patch, the development of an aneurysm was seen and was resected in the same setting without any difficulties.	1.1868934811634397
The particular items with special regard to the postoperative course are delineated in the following report.	1.1606095348304057
The situation of oncological surgery in Germany was evaluated by sending a questionnaire in January 1998 to 1979 registered surgical clinics.	0.9898440558593301
A total of 938 responded and stated that they are involved in that field.	0.942963896498933
In 72 % of the departments oncological surgery adds up to 10-30 % of their overall work.	1.2399101103352514
The proportion of oncological surgery correlated to hospital size and is highest in university clinics.	0.8441469476279759
Colorectal surgery is 93 % and is the leading topographical field in oncological surgery.	1.362623471726241
73 % of the hospitals regularly perform gastric tumor surgery.	1.1204694972670242
The proportion of hospitals with breast surgery is surprisingly high (45 %).	0.9549914864837411
Many hospitals (54.6 %) report neoadjuvant treatment regimens.	1.006923108682554
Together with adjuvant therapy this rate amounts to 85.2 %.	0.7294921115829116
The diagnostic spectrum of the hospitals involved in the inquiry is statisfactory.	1.0051783005382717
However, the modern possibilities of network and telecommunication are not sufficiently used.	1.0412770275358219
A second opinion is required predominantly in their own department or clinic, but not between centers.	1.1610395511580847
The surgeon's position concerning the speciality "surgical oncology" is ambivalent: only 35.3 % of the department chiefs support this speciality - and over 90 % of the departments reject the structural independence of "surgical oncology" from "visceral surgery".	1.147323209623368
Cryosurgery is a widely accepted modality for the treatment of capillary hemangiomas of the newborn.	1.0975531952827096
However, no studies clearly supporting its effectivity are available.	1.0962799103317697
A considerable number of patients with cardiovascular diseases suffer from advanced heart failure.	0.805202193480959
Actuarial 6-12 month survival of such patients is reduced to 50-75%.	0.9477587860021711
Since introduction of triple immunosuppression including cyclosporine, azathioprine and corticosteroids heart transplantation has been established as treatment of choice for patients with advanced heart failure refractory to medical treatment.	0.9936878513054128
However, the increasing imbalance between demand and supply of suitable donor organs limits the number of patients for this therapeutic option and requires a more restrictive listing of patients for heart transplantation.	1.2273365031024013
During the last few years promising new conservativ and alternativ surgical therapies have been developed.	1.0091021846193762
The conservativ medical therapy was improved by application of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and anticongestive betablockers.	0.762785386247791
Alternativ surgical therapies of advanced heart failure include high risk bypass surgery, high risk valve surgery, mechanical assist devices, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, partial left ventriculectomy, cardiomyoplasty and multisite-pacing.	0.9978147568451947
They serve as bridge to transplantation or medium- and long-term alternatives to heart transplantation.	0.8508815422439007
The therapeutic success is determined by adequate selection of patients for the respective therapy.	1.105922957066126
This requires the implementation of risk scores on the basis of national and international registries of patients with advanced heart failure.	0.8981623924982461
Motion analysis of the cervical spine is a sensitive tool in the fields of preventive and clinical biomechanics of whiplash.	0.9592576525021101
In the field of preventive biomechanics motion analysis contributes to validation and optimisation of dummy based crash test experiments and simulations.	0.7918379959275267
In the clinical field motion analysis up to now is of restricted value.	1.0710766364142197
Data exist about restrictions and pathologies of movement and motion of the cervical spine, coordinative disturbances, postural control, TMJ-function and oculomotor disturbances after whiplash.	0.8326276602483395
The standardisation of technical and clinical set-ups is necessary to establish a well proven biomechnical model of whiplash and whiplash related biomechanical dysfunction.	0.9606385531324324
Without this model the value of motion analysis for clinical use will be restricted due to lack of comparable data on sensitivity and specificity although motion analysis of the cervical spine is neither cost- nor time consuming and free of adverse effects.	1.021580044462885
Within a prospective series of 28 patients (14 m/ 14 f) with a follow-up to six weeks we were lucky to describe numerically two different types of reaction to low energy (v < 20 km/h) rear end collision: Type I with disturbances in complex movements only, Type II with overall restriction of movement.	1.1559016634215977
Control of angular velocity during cyclic movements of the head was disturbed by oscillations of higher frequency in all patients.	0.9393266684567846
Recovery from whiplash within 6 weeks could be monitored.	0.7510423207406384
Diagnosis of parasomnias in the sleep laboratory is difficult since the nocturnal behavior reported by the patients often does not show up in the laboratory.	0.9975466141120193
To test the efficacy of sleep deprivation as a tool to provoke somnambulism we investigated ten patients (three women and seven men, mean age 27 +/- 3.4) with somnambulism.	1.1301326505324323
Their standard polysomnographies and videomonitored nocturnal behavior was compared to that of sex- and age-matched controls and to polysomnography and behavior after sleep deprivation.	1.0007298121823858
Patients with parasomnias and controls did not show significant differences in sleep parameters with the exception of longer arousal duration in controls, which was nonsignificant.	1.2079682059635721
In magnetic resonance tomography, patients with parasomnias did not reveal abnormality of the brain that might explain release of nocturnal behavior.	1.1777027797964361
Sleep deprivation led to significantly reduced number of arousals, reduced arousal index, significantly prolonged arousal duration and more stage shifts from all sleep stages (nonsignificant).	1.0072457371497572
Complex behavior during sleep increased under sleep deprivation, whereas sleepwalking did not increase.	0.9754779198645332
The majority of complex behavior during sleep is triggered by stage shifts and not by arousal in the sense of the arousal definition of the American Sleep Disorder Society.	1.0822672784442888
Complex behavior in sleep is stereotypical and nonviolent.	0.6255134379595806
Its complexity seems to depend on the duration and intensity of arousals.	0.8540979745818847
Sleep deprivation can be recommended as an efficacious method of increasing complex behavior in sleep, which is a preliminary stage of sleepwalking.	1.1706978705496074
Concerning the underlying pathology it seems to be important to register the quality and duration of stimuli that trigger arousals instead of focusing the number of arousals alone.	1.0326143151947087
Introduction: In order to investigate whether operative technique determines the 5-year recurrence and survival rates, we analysed the results obtained by two surgical departments using two different operative techniques.	1.3008177936594854
Department A: Removal of the tumour and a number of lymph nodes; department B: En-bloc resection in accordance with the requirements of standardised tumour surgery.	0.9440372407328067
Patients and methods: The surgical results obtained with all patients with colorectal carcinoma operated on between 1984 and 1988 (department A: 152 colon and 53 rectal carcinomas; department B: 124 colon and 177 rectal carcinomas).	1.0267445378966398
Results: The local recurrence rate achieved by department A was signicantly higher (colon carcinoma: department A 25 %; department B 10 %; rectal carcinoma: department A 54 %; department B 16 %).	1.1735491895386019
The 5-year survival rate for colon carcinoma was 65 % in department A, and 66 % in department B, the corresponding figures for rectal carcinoma being 49 % and 72 %, respectively.	1.400623209846876
Conclusion: The results indicate that carcinoma of the colorectum should be operated on only at an institution that complies with the standards required for surgery of colorectal carcinoma.	1.183488697781305
Definition of the problem: Ethics consultation is one of the most important ways in which clinical ethicists can support both health-care providers and patients and their relatives in coping with ethical and existential challenges.	0.9745916191645111
The practice of ethics consultation, as performed at the Freiburg University Hospital is described and illustrated by a case report about the problem of treatment termination.	1.1320224605993288
The range of subject matters that come up in ethics consultations is analyzed.	0.818110655768466
A research program in clinical ethics is summarized that has been undertaken to pave the way for a specific and interdisciplinary analysis of needs; from there on, the investigation aims at further developing clinical ethics support services.	1.0235199615976838
Suggestions for criteria of competence for ethics consultants are formulated on the basis of both the author's and international work.	1.0318768763671216
Finally, the issues of structural conditions for establishing clinical ethics in the German-speaking world are raised and the long-term prospect of ethics consultation as an instrument for learning and teaching ethics in the health-care system is highlighted.	1.052053684667106
Objectives Bridging of an extensive bone defect with a long stem revision prosthesis anchored in the diaphysis to restore a pain free function of the limb.	1.017871294853503
A total of 205 patients suffering from stage I and stage II melanoma were investigated with reference to psychosocial stress, social support and attitude to offers of psychotherapeutic support.	1.0777425464860497
Additional counselling by their dermatologist was considered helpful by 59% of the patients, and interviews with a psychotherapist, by 20%.	1.10176606012257
Patients who where more anxious about a progression of the cancer and thought they had not been given sufficient information about their illness preferred to seek help from the dermatologist.	0.976609431225535
Patients who appreciated additional counselling by a psychotherapist were usually those with a poorer prognosis for their melanoma and those on whom psychosocial distress weighed especially heavily and who had less social support.	0.9668621391911756
The original structure of the synovial membrane is completely destroyed in the rheumatoid synovium and is characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration, synoviocyte proliferation, neo-vascularization, and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins.	0.8560615201716582
Adhesion molecules play an important role in the development of these pathologic changes.	0.7500217698426331
In this review we discuss the role of the adhesion receptors of the selectin, integrin and immunglobulin families and of the CD44 molecule in the cell-cell and cell-matrix interaction in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory changes in rheumatoid arthritis.	1.0056422035974812
During the last five years several authors have reported largely satisfactory results, using the steroid intravenous anaesthetic eltanolone (pregnanolone) for induction of anaesthesia after administering a bolus dose.	1.045255552463006
Until now, however, no investigations have been undertaken, dealing with the infusion pharmacokinetics of eltanolone after arterial blood sampling and using slow induction to quantify the concentration-effect relationship.	1.005671249817456
Secondary objectives were to assess the haemodynamic and respiratory effects.	0.8418192857906109
Background: Intraoperative measurements of local intracapillary hemoglobin oxygenation of the human cochlea via the round window membrane have been shown to be possible using the Erlangen microlight-guided spectrophotometer.	1.1576051048838285
The aim of the present study was to develop a new microlight guide suitable for measurements in the round window niche and to evaluate electrophysiologically the possible impact of the procedure on the cochlea.	1.0867510278308952
High-dose UVA1 therapy is an effective treatment of patients with acute atopic dermatitis.	1.2686578541325046
However, some patients do not respond well to this new therapy.	1.1391623206766741
We attempted to further characterize the non-responder population in a retrospective study.	0.9042311684174794
Two closely matched groups of responders (n=20) and non-responders (n=20) were compared.	0.9555145286174596
No significant differences were observed between both groups with respect to the following parameters: skin type, minimal erythema dose, single and cumulative doses of UVA1, and peripheral blood eosinophils.	1.2165304905454988
However, non-responders were characterized by a highly elevated atopic score, and by high levels of total IgE and of specific IgE.	1.3489941542024224
Furthermore, colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus occured at higher densities, and intestinal growth of Candida albicans was more frequently observed.	1.2999178780451743
These data indicate that high-dose UVA1 irradiation is not effective in all patients suffering from atopic dermatitis.	1.1623761167077322
We conclude that non-responders with complicating infections might benefit from the combination of high-dose UVA1 therapy and antibiotic or antimycotic treatment.	1.0558792712803
Introduction: Many causes are given as  the main reason for inadequate pain therapy.	1.327999344024878
The objective of our study was to demonstrate the current position of doctors in general practice all over Austria who prescribe prescriptions.	0.9457100078073893
We report a woman with erythema palmare hereditarium, an anomaly not documented so far in the German literature.	1.1271760829081947
It is characterized by a bright erythema of the palms, usually persistent since birth.	0.911546472724944
It is transmitted in an autosomal-recessive mode and has a benign course.	0.9668078184283359
In our patient it was possible to trace the palmar erythema over three generations.	1.0143556440808694
The decline of STD in the region of Rostock, Germany, since 1945 is explained by a decreasing incidence of gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis.	0.9860387582154293
On the other hand chlamydial and candidal infections have increased.	0.9496424259599062
The rate of chlamydia infections was about 45% in our venerological patients, as common as gonorrhea used to be.	1.214496837036623
Genital candidal infections were to be found in 23%.	0.735842918486522
Mycoplasmas were identified in 15%, usually combined with other pathogens except in some cases of vaginitis.	1.2568894285658323
The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has changed considerably in the last few decades.	1.0888039266226068
Clinical observation of mainly unicentric pathogenesis with continuous expansion and subclinical involvement of adjoining regions of lymph nodes has resulted in the introduction of a large-field technique with total nodal irradiation (TNI) or total lymphatic irradiation (TLI).	1.05113716843989
The introduction of polychemotherapy has led to further improvement in the cure rate and in considerations concerning using both methods and adapting them to the stage and risk.	1.0192494521986109
Today the combination of radiation and chemotherapy leads to a reduction in the amount of radiation required in the affected regions (involved field irradiation = IFI).	0.9684179227083098
The German Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was founded by Martin Waßmund in 1951.	0.8452854886832597
One of the main reasons was the need for scientific representation in the council at a medical convention.	1.1385742927801539
The Society, originally composed of 52 members, was first called "The German Society of Maxillofacial Surgery".	1.0894164270826199
In 1972, it extended its title to include the term "oral" ("Mund") and currently comprises 620 members.	1.3309614488495485
A scientific conference is held annually on a specific topic.	0.7495647331214101
The lectures given there have been published since 1954 in "Fortschritte der Kiefer- und Gesichts-Chirurgie" (Progress in Maxillofacial Surgery) by Thieme Verlag; since 1997, they have appeared as a Springer-Verlag supplement.	1.0976656060408556
Topics of choice are published in "Mund,- Kiefer- und Gesichtschirurgie" ("Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery"), originally by Hanser in Munich and now by Springer-Verlag in Heidelberg.	1.262819541254525
In this manner, it was possible to completely document the scientific activities and progress in this specialty.	0.9953853506389294
Each year since 1957, a prize named after M. Waßmund, has been given for outstanding scientific accomplishment.	1.060115290941219
The presidents, convention locations, topics, and prizewinners are listed in a table.	0.9143629310606781
Since the founding of the Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, close cooperation has existed with the National Association of German Oral and Maxillary-Facial Surgeons (Bundesverband der Deutschen Ärzte für Mund-Kiefer-Gesichts-Chirurgie).	0.8625436583929103
In order to intertwine scientific and political interests, a fusion of these two organizations is planned for the year 2000.	1.1012579985125022
The hepatorenal syndrome is defined as the development of renal failure in patients with severe liver disease in the absence of any other identifiable cause of renal functional impairment.	1.155225855109897
The pathogenesis of this obviously functional renal failure is complex and not completely understood.	0.9660846902465879
Of importance seems to be a peripheral and systemic vasodilatation with redistribution of blood volume.	0.9981988727203894
Nitric oxide seems to play a major role as a possible primary mediator.	1.0211966691212566
As a consequence changes in several different pathophysiological mechanisms (sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin, endothelin, prostanoids, natriuretic peptides) lead to a functional renal impairment which is characterized by renal cortical vasoconstriction.	0.977582371927627
Supportive treatment and intensive monitoring of the cardiovascular circulation is the main goal in the care of these patients.	1.228189850683647
The mortality is still high exceeding 90%.	0.8790666619765206
Renal extracorporeal support should be initiated using a continuous method when recovery of liver function is expected (acute liver failure, waiting for liver transplantation).	0.9674398349143877
The only effective and permanent treatment is orthotopic liver transplantation.	0.8071468184931777
A 16 year old patient with the typical clinical signs of Albright's hereditary dystrophia developed series of epileptic seizures with loss of consciousness, tonic muscle contractions and bite of the tongue.	1.008234484182173
After termination of the seizures there was coma without focal neurological signs.	0.6584931586760016
CT scan revealed diffuse brain edema.	0.5314800476022356
Electroencephalographic studies showed generalized slowing.	0.6198127183425842
In laboratory tests the only abnormalities were marked hypocalcemia (1.15 mmol/l) and hyperphosphatemia.	1.1361076525988674
Blood parathyroid hormone (PTH) was elevated.	0.8649392115974641
PTH-Test confirmed the diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism.	0.8424463935855789
The patient was treated with calcium and 1,25-dihydroxy-cholecalciferol.	1.091168319774902
After few days the severe encephalopathy, CT and electroencephalographic changes were completely reversible.	0.9729333816147546
Hereditary disturbances of the parathyroid hormone metabolism are rare diseases.	0.9731923879549244
Hypocalcemia must be included into the differential diagnosis of seizures and brain edema to avoid invasive diagnostic and irrational treatment.	0.9986811422804541
An adequate increase of uterine blood flow throughout gestation is essential for uterine, placental and fetal growth.	0.8372773980606695
Maternal cardiovascular adaptation has to provide the uterine perfusion that is necessary to meet the requirements of the developing and growing fetus by providing transport of nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and the fetus.	1.0419384129749616
Thus uterine blood flow is inextricably linked to fetal growth and survival.	0.8594911653142316
Reductions of uterine blood flow can occur under acute or chronic conditions or in a combination of both.	0.8754725947647679
Chronic reductions of uterine blood flow can be observed in pregnancy induced hyertension (PIH), diabetes mellitus in pregnancy and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).	0.9973451046279744
Chronic restrictions in uterine blood flow will elicit a placental and fetal response in the form of growth adaptation to the reduced supply of oxygen and nutrients to the conceptus.	0.9386951874284211
If compensatory growth restriction reaches its limits intrauterine fetal distress can ensue.	0.7320159115141263
In view of a possible Stent implantation, 20 infrarenal abdominal aneurysms obtained consecutively during postmortem examinations were investigated.	1.0563624880143954
Measurements were performed according to toporegional criteria on the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysms as well as on their lengths and diameters.	0.943372294926943
Then we correlated the extent of the proximal and distal necks to the aneurysmal lengths and diameters, respectively.	0.9484502680329456
The following results were obtained: 1.	0.8950892628414971
Depending on the increase in length of the infrarenal abdominal aneurysm, there is an inproportional shortening of the proximal and distal neck.	1.2246293201668
Up to an aneurysmal length of 4 cm both proximal and distant necks are suitable for stent fixation in all cases.	0.7898577027070304
With lengths of more than 4 cm according to the morphological results, the distal neck is almost always unsuitable for fixation of a simple Tube-Stent.	1.0745135687546807
The proximal neck is suitable for stent fixation in all cases up to an aneurysmal length of 10 cm.	0.8329999310684061
For longer aneurysms, only a quarter of all cases is suitable for stent implantation.	1.1011206060928709
In all cases investigated there were severe arteriosclerotic changes with atheromatous ulcerations and secondary wall-adherent thrombi of up to three centimeter thickness in the aneurysmal and para-aneurysmal regions.	0.9206279591552475
These findings have to be considered, with respect to the transluminal transport of the prosthesis as well as in the regions of the supposed implantation in the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysm with individually variable arteriosclerotic changes of the aorta.	1.1955786825943189
We report on a case of paraganglioma of the cauda equina in a 48-year-old man.	1.037657743191604
These slow-growing, mostly benign and encapsulated intradural-extramedullar tumours are clinically characterized by lumbago, paraesthesia and motor deficits as well as occasi-onally by incontinence.	0.8841161823054089
Paragangliomas of the cauda equina show monomorphous (main) cells arranged in a typical cell cluster pattern, demonstrating a lobular architecture and a fine net of connective tissue formed by so-called sustentacular cells; some tumours show focal ganglionic differentiation.	0.9024135308844488
Because of their morphological similarity to the more common ependymomas, paragangliomas of the cauda equina are sometimes misdiagnosed so that their incidence is likely to be higher than previously estimated.	0.9694657218330185
Immunohistochemistry findings are positive for neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin and other neuronal markers as well as neuropeptides (main cells) and S-100 protein (sustentacular cells) while widely lacking reactivity for GFAP.	1.0434021072900335
Paragangliomas of the cauda equina represent a rare entity, of which only 80 cases have been described in the literature.	1.0286970392385508
Because they only occur sporadically, they are often not included in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the region of the cauda equina.	1.0581484766655218
Approximately one out of every three patients with carcinoma of the cervix must be expected to experience a recurrence.	1.105781116632345
The treatment of such relapses is dependent on the site and extension of the recurrence, the type of primary therapy administered and the patient's general condition.	1.2571615247319994
The limit conditions for the application of the established forms of therapy available - surgical operation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy - are complex and seldom documented by randomized studies.	1.1952438120892135
In general, empiric observations and historical analyses determine the backdrop against which therapy is planned.	0.8069381512009024
The main experiences available are compiled in this paper to give a basis for individual treatment of patients with recurrences.	1.14886029186859
Post-traumatic pyogenic liver abscess is a rare disease.	0.9711414517154584
We present the case of a 38-year-old man with multilocular liver abscess and pleural empyema following blunt abdominal trauma.	0.9368217192836825
The patient had a prodrome lasting 3 months before presenting in our department.	0.8212928663836955
The therapy included partial hepatectomy and pleural drainage.	0.5872741868124033
Clinical signs, diagnosis and possible therapy are discussed in this case report.	1.2968597236528974
The dream of every hospital computer scientist is a completely computerized flow of information in his/her facility: admission, diagnosis, treatment, transfer, and discharge of patients.	0.9392747902511892
However, in developing such general hospital information systems, one runs into the following problems: (1) medical and administrative information systems form a very heterogeneous environment; (2) the structure of medical information is extremely complex, except for certain limited administrative data (admission, transfer, and discharge, for example) needed by the clinic administration.	1.1761634778293613
As a result it is nearly impossible to transfer medical information from one system to another without a loss of data.	1.0413912756264423
One cannot expect a universal solution to this problem within the next few years.	0.7952756407116516
Therefore we present a concept which, based on existing tools, allows communication between medical information systems.	1.1353323295524267
Shave excision of nevi is a technique still under debate.	0.6816953884995015
Speed, simplicity, and the fact that it provides excised material for histologic examination are contrasted with the lack of excision margins and a higher rate of nevus recurrences.	1.126093147651452
In this study, the pros and cons of shave excision were evaluated.	0.8578870315618325
The congenital dyserythropoietic anemias represent a group of rare inborn errors with ineffective erythropoiesis as the predominant mechanism of anemia.	0.7899301851949247
They are primarily classified into three types on the basis of characteristic abnormalities of the erythroblasts as shown by light and electron microscopy.	0.9100782433336353
There are distinct associated features such as pattern of heredity, cell kinetics and abnormalities of the cell membrane.	0.942217381130672
In addition, patients with apparent CDA of heterogenous phenotype are observed, that cannot be attributed to any of the three types.	1.2176488340054041
Recently variant genes have been localized to different regions on chromosome 15 or 22.	0.7953012742321925
Cases of CDA were reported from many ethnics, in particular in families of meditarranean origin.	1.0451627952235851
Many patients load iron necessitating iron depletion.	0.5634448076747661
Gallstones are a frequent complication and are observed in childhood or adolescence.	0.978820233495344
Therapeutic measures such as splenectomy, treatment by Interferon  or allogeneic bome marrow transplantation depend on the type and the severity of clinical expression, which shows large variations both within and between affected kindreds.	1.0658964489760245
Sarcopenia is a constant in aging.	0.7026607719569612
Observed over long periods, it can reach 1% per year.	1.199046046030399
But it is such a tenuous phenomenon that it cannot be observed over short periods at steady state.	0.8835256192107953
The aging phenomenon mainly hits fibers, Type II but on aged muscle thin, normal, and hypertrophic fibers cohabit with sclerosis and fat increases.	0.9556681325893271
Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is characterised by stage-dependent microangiopathy.	0.9512594724538005
With increasing severity there is a decrease in the number of skin capillaries and the oxygen partial pressure.	0.9250747986962372
The cutaneous vascular reserve, which is measured by laser-doppler fluxmetry, is reduced.	1.216904595681049
Cutaneous microangiopathy is one of the main causes of the trophic disturbances associated with CVI.	0.9477279078121927
Low frequency pulsed current improves cutaneous microcirculation and thus nutrition as well as accelerating the formation of granulation tissue.	0.805273003339637
In a open prospective pilot study, 15 patients suffering from CVI with persistent leg ulcers were treated with low frequency pulsed current (Dermapulse), which is thought to improve particularly the tissue microcirculation.	1.1751849859220118
The average age of the patients was 70.3 years and the average duration of ulceration was 79.1 months.	1.2977792906526104
The patients were treated over a period of 38 days.	1.182535009456224
With this treatmen, 2 ulcers healed completely and 13 showed a reduction of size of on average 63%.	0.9715627192874183
Capillary density increased by 43.5%, while transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure increased by 82.4%.	1.067017998514977
Electrostimulation is a treatment with few or no side effects.	0.9499780893347117
From 1986 to 1996, we implanted a total of 92 hip arthroplasties (86 cementless, 4 hybrid and 2 cemented) in 65 patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	1.1131300743681556
Of the 89 uncemented cups, 59 were threaded cups (Hofer-Imhof n = 45, Zweymüller n = 7, Mecring n = 5, PM n = 2) and 30 were hemispherical cups of the Harris Galante type I and II.	0.9998612213047253
87 stems were implanted without cement (Zweymüller SL n = 58, Uni n = 16, Schenker n = 9, Zweymüller I n = 4) and 5 with cement.	1.0720903121444247
One patient died postoperatively and three (4 implants) within the first year.	1.295429884603725
To date, one cup of each threaded type had to be revised because of loosening (revision rate approx.	1.0228359634043735
6.8 %); Up to now, three of 87 (approx.	1.1347816515764118
3.4 %) stem revisions (1 x Zweymüller I, 1 x Schenker, 1 x Zweymüller SL) have been undertaken.	1.4285697807255502
Ten patients with twelve hip arthroplasties did not return for follow-up; some of them had a poor general health status.	1.0882255844549542
The clinical and radiological results of the arthroplasties of 52 patients showed a Harris Hip Score averaging 72 after an average of 54 months (min.	1.1452275053077001
Ten patients had minor complaints in the hip region.	0.7803007721016797
79 % of the uncemented implants (70 out of 89 cups, 69 out of 87 stems) were assessed radiologically.	1.1827634499029513
Two threaded cups showed slight migration after cancellous bone grafting in the presence of acetabular protrusion that was present in a total of 13 hip joints.	0.9412428715752524
This subsided markedly after filling with cancellous bone and recentering of the hip joint.	0.7077737522489292
Homogeneous incorporation of the bone grafting und thus remodelling of the medial wall was achieved, with the bone graft exhibiting marked reduction.	1.2737851380850373
At final follow-up, approx.	0.7825373192948569
75 % of the cementless cups had complete bone ingrowth without any evidence of radiolucency (type I), approx.	1.0485583561473764
19 % had near-complete bone ingrowth with minimal radiolucencies in one zone or in a maximum of 50 % of the bone contact area (type II) and approx.	1.1443958411412474
6 % had radiolucencies in more than 50 % of the bone contact area (type III).	1.204897149160672
The radiographic evaluation of the most frequently used stem (Zweymüller SL) showed approx.	1.1689869587336563
47 % with only slight remodelling of the calcar (type I), approx.	1.2121954663318981

Abstract   The 5th edition of the TNM classification entails a number of changes concerning head and neck tumors.	0.9849845231625102
The division of stage IV tumors into three subcategories marks a significant expansion of the stage grouping procedure.	0.8150602888979981
Methods: In a retrospective study the clinical course of 3247 patients with head and neck carcinomas were comparatively evaluated according to the 4th and 5th editions of the new TNM classification.	1.142720826251445
In particular it was the aim of the study to test the prognostic relevance of the subdivision of stage IV especially in mucosal cancer.	0.9941033255151526
Results: In classifying the primary tumor the most extensive changes were noted for supraglottic and salivary gland tumors.	1.1313240929199901
On the basis of the 4th edition of the TNM classification the following recurrence-free 5-year survival rates for 3033 cases of mucosal cancer were calculated: stage I 91,0%, stage II 78,6%, stage III 61,4%, stage IV 31,0%.	1.152748206264477
The calculations based on the 5th edition yielded: stage I 91,0%, stage II 77,2%, stage III 61,2%, stage IVA 32,4%, stage IVB 25,3%, stage IVC 3,6%.	1.2845699855194674
Conclusions: The adequacy of the revised stage classification in establishing a prognostic hierarchy was confirmed.	0.9021446840685786
However, a significant prognostic distinction between N2- (stage IVA) and N3-metastasis (stage IVB) could not be found.	1.4720992479182364
The microcirculation is the organ that provides the direct link between blood and tissue, and thereby between the whole organism and the single cell.	1.1132285001806923
Modern microcirculation research in experimental surgery is characterized by the use of high-resolution video fluorescence microscopy and quantitative computer-assisted image analysis coupled with the techniques of molecular biology and transgenic or knock-out gene technology.	0.9842086939119377
These advances should improve knowledge about surgically relevant physiologic and pathophysiologic phenomena at the interface between blood and tissues and help us to understand the initial molecular mechanisms leading to organ dysfunction following inflammation, ischemia-reperfusion, and transplantation.	0.9678099594656273
Legal and moral considerations hinder the introduction of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in Germany.	0.9064890035024923
This article presents and discusses the ethical arguments for and against PGD.	0.9199084422203525
In the autor's view neither the fact that PGD is not a well established technique nor the danger that single-cell-analysis may lead to misdiagnosis convincingly demonstrates that PGD is morally inacceptable.	1.01186661802346
Inconsistencies in ethical positions which defend abortions but do not accept PGD are highlighted.	0.6812674020559083
The use of arguments dealing with the prediction of negative social consequences after establishing PGD is criticised.	0.8011032946946596
Extensive counselling prior to PGD should be implemented in order to help couples which want to use the new technique to make an autonomous decision.	0.9831400559012355
The SOFA score, a new system for patients with sepsis-related diseases, was introduced in 1994 by the "Working Group on Sepsis-Related Problems of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine."	1.2080350543448488
The purpose of this study was to compare the new SOFA score with the APACHE II and MOD scores.	0.7931637632205718
The data on 874 patients from a surgical intensive care unit in an university hospital were analyzed using commercially available software (SPSS for Windows, Version 7.5.2 and MS Excel '97).	1.1151544460137492
To compare the different scores, receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) - analyses were applied.	1.0002979308222921
The study demonstrated a clear correlation between an elevated SOFA score and the mortality of the patients during their ICU stay (score 0 -> mortality 0 %, 1 -> 3.6 %, 2 -> 22.5 %, 3 -> 86,7 %, respectively r = 0.445; P = 0,01).	1.4039024413648085
The ROC analyses of the APACHE II, the MOD and the SOFA scores were comparable (area under the curve: APACHE II 0.73, MOD 0.77, SOFA 0.71).	0.9275647957112734
In conclusion, the SOFA score is reliable and might be useful in the daily routine of an intensive care unit.	1.015478437267463
In individual patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), established prognostic factors do not satisfactorily predict clinical outcome.	0.991679803434023
For the first time we investigated a total of 100 HNSCC by Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) to define chromosomal alterations that are associated with the patients prognosis.	1.1748062091150935
Patients were followed for at latest 4 but at least 2 years after surgery or until death.	1.1064043480421994
During this observation period twenty-nine of them died because of cancer disease.	1.0624397950593822
The Kaplan-Meier method was used plotting survival curves for every single chromosomal alteration as well as every clinico-pathological parameter.	0.8423955350617388
The curves were tested for significance by the log rank as well as the Breslow test.	1.0986816666924146
Significance of particular prognostic parameters was then evaluated by the Cox regression model.	0.8581729908197333
The overall survival time as well as the recurrence free survival time were significantly lower in patients who's tumors showed amplifications of the chromosomal region 11q13 (p=0.0008 for LR and p=0.0024 for B).	1.078878184092184
The survival time of the patients was also lower if the carcinomas carried overrepresentations of chromosome 3q (p=0.0299 for LR and p=0.0546 for B).	1.032525010292641
Multivariate analysis (Cox's proportional hazards model) revealed both alterations as most important independent prognostic factors in HNSCC.	0.9310488248873875
None of the conventional clinico-pathological parameters (pT-, pN-status, UICC stage, grading) achieved statistical significance in the multivariate model.	1.1223382207888397
These results suggest that in HNSCC the occurence of 11q13 amplification and 3q overrepresentation are highly significant independent prognostic markers and of better value than the established TNM and grading criteria.	0.9227580161773319
We report a coincidence of balloon cell melanoma and balloon cell transformation in a dermal nevus of a 56 years old female patient.	1.2515550112272578
The foamy cells in both tumors with different dignity expressed S-100 and Vimentin.	0.9812361500141595
HMB45 was expressed in all balloon cells of the melanoma.	0.8848093530954142
Detection of HMB45 in some of the nevus-associated balloon cells was considered as an expression of cellular activation.	0.9010787617006782
We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a malignant, primary plaque-type blue naevus in a 61-year-old male.	1.1689244618535108
Two biopsy specimens had been examined within 13 years, and revealed a common and cellular blue variant as a precursor.	1.0484877350807944
Locally invasive growth and regional lymph node swelling were present, but these alone could not confirm malignancy before evaluation of all clinical and histopathological features, as they are known to occur with benign cellular blue naevi.	1.2003277746992211
The recent literature and our case indicate that there is a malignant potential in every histological and clinical variant of blue naevus.	1.0772210093563457
It is difficult to provide valid data with regard to changes in incidence and prevalence of acute pancreatitis in Germany.	0.9198339329571174
The lack of information is due to strict legal regulations to protect personal data, a certain lack of interest in epidemiological research and the lack of exact statistics of diseases treated in hospitals.	1.0444208689901628
The incidence of acute pancreatitis in other industrialized Western countries is about 10 new cases per year and 100,000 inhabitants.	0.9785659460761545
The increase of alcohol consumption over the last 30 years is associated with an increase of ethanol-induced pancreatitis.	1.0932022710065017
One may speculate that due to improved diagnostic possibilities, such as CT scan, cases where acute pancreatitis is diagnosed at autopsy are rare.	1.0028008034294074
Due to the increase in alcohol consumption it can be assume that the incidence and prevalence of chronic pancreatitis have increased in Germany similar to well-documented data from Denmark.	1.191092320019482
Since alcohol consumption is slightly decreasing in Germany it is likely that the present incidence of about 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis per 100,000 inhabitants will also decrease.	1.085544828924697
Process-Experiential (PE) therapy is a neo-humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client-centered emphasis on a genuine, estecming, empathic relationship and the active, task-focused process-directive style of Gestalt therapie.	0.5338090966963029
This form of treatment is scientifically validated (Grawe 1997).	0.7685588396244816
Its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory.	0.3499117596910416
It incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks, each of which is characterized by specific client marker and resolution state, series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution, and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps.	0.5168164423549803
This second part of the review provides an overview of specific therapeutic tasks.	0.8170130070725798
At last suggestions for practical implementation are discussed, and available outcome data is summarized.	0.9251887240019036
The human arterial blood pressure shows not only exogenic alterations, but also spontaneous fluctuations.	1.081572663208976
This blood pressure variability has both scientific and clinical relevance.	0.9448362295777385
A well-known phenomenon is the so-called "white coat hyptertension" which may severely affect diagnosis and therapy of essential hypertension.	1.0403978996049603
Furthermore, several studies have provided evidence that the degree of end-organ damage in hypertensive patients is closely related to the circardian blood pressure variability.	1.2457418887311205
Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that an optimal antihypertensive treatment should take an improvement of the blood pressure variability into consideration.	1.2978579969443336
The faeces sign is a recently described computed tomography (CT) feature of small-bowel obstruction and is seen as a mottled, faeces-like content within the lumen of the dilated loops above the level of the obstacle.	0.9713584339230433
To evaluate its prevalence, significance, and diagnostic value we retrospectively reviewed 94 consecutive cases of small-intestine obstruction studied with CT in the last 6 years.	1.0905992907390842
The faeces sign was recognizable in 7 cases (7.4 %) and was localized within ileal loops in all these subjects.	1.1060001966413568
In 6 of the 7 cases there was a simple and progressive obstruction, while there was a sudden onset with intestinal strangulation in only 1.	1.1890580048898165
The faeces sign is due to the intraluminal stagnation of enteric material and is generally recognizable in subjects with subacute obstruction.	0.8802185239251902
In our experience it is relatively uncommon.	0.7568736418425434
Nevertheless, it seems to be rather specific and may be a valuable accessory feature in the CT study of small-bowel obstruction.	1.3438342366627252
A case report is presented to illustrate the cutaneous manifestations in essential thrombocythaemia.	1.0724818794541788
Knowledge of the related skin lesions may lead to earlier detection of this myeloproliferative disorder.	0.8920223508983084
Treatment may prevent severe haemorrhagic or thrombotic complications.	0.6597624596743273
Erythromelalgia is causally related to thrombocythaemia; prompt relief of painful symptoms after treatment with aspirin is typical.	0.8768256941836621
Surgical treatment of proximal aortic disease traditionally consists of composite replacement of valve and aorta.	0.8415245622237292
Recent reconstructive procedures on the aortic root allow for treatment of aortic dilatation and concomitant aortic valve regurgitation without the associated disadvanteages of mechanical heart valves.	0.918284235900379
Two psychotic patients developed hyperglycaemia several weeks after starting olanzapine.	0.7697933218311737
In one case the elevated glucose concentrations returned to normal soon after withdrawal of olanzapine.	0.9410009474390622
In the second case severe ketoacidosis with letal outcome occured.	0.8240638782090819
Profilometry is a novel procedure allowing precise analysis of skin surface structure.	0.9098428615730854
With the help of a synthetic material a negative image of a defined area of the skin is taken.	1.1962122134369528
During the subsequent analytical procedure the roughness is determined by means of a profilometer.	0.9364054968884197
A commercially available statistics software program is used for statistical analysis of the results.	0.8810481084743386
This procedure was applied to check for to evaluate positive effects of oestrogen creams on the structure of the skin surface on the face.	1.1281691826342608
This article describes the historic roots of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) from the first experiments at 1800 until the introduction into the pharmaceutical market in 1899.	0.9345733994855959
In 1869, Hermann Kolbe enlightened the chemical structure of salicylic acid, which was used at that time as an analgetic and antipyretic drug.	0.9135993156838259
Because of the side effects, for example the irritation of the stomach, analytical chemists and pharmacologists searched for chemical modifications.	0.9357458986106728
In August 1897 Felix Hoffmann (1868-1946) was successful in acetylizing the salicylic acid to acetylsalicyl acid (ASA).	0.8217602768629307
Between 1897 and 1899 Kurt Witthauer (1865-1911) collected clinical data and experiences on the efficiency of ASA as an analgetic and antipyretic drug.	0.7794315012061561
In 1899 ASA was introduced into the pharamaceutical market as Aspirin and became soon one of the most successful drugs of its time.	0.994133219152144
The indication exceeds analgesia in the mean time and to prophylaxis of myocardial ischaemia or cerebral stroke, among others.	1.033791054904019
Background: The results of the Cryo-ROP group showed that cryotherapy significantly reduces the rate of adverse morphological and functional outcome of eyes with threshold retinopathy of prematurity.	1.0295237834603996
Structural status and visual acuity of 48 eyes which consecutively underwent cryocoagulation in our hospital between 1990 and 1994 were examined at 2 years corrected gestational age.	1.0315154891107166
Despite wide-spread immunisation programs epidemic influenza continues to cause ten thousands of deaths worldwide, every year, especially in the high risk groups of elderly or immunocompromised persons.	0.9869247450823063
At present, amantadine and rimantadine are the only approved agents available for prophylactic and therapeutic use, yet, the deployment of these substances is problematic: neither of the two drugs is effective against influenza B, their use is accompanied by rapid development of viral resistance, and they show many adverse effects.	1.1647074840428002
In contrast, zanamivir and GS4071/GS4104 are rationally developed influenza-specific neuraminidase inhibitors, proving prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against influenza A and B, as well in vitro as in animal models, and in experimental human studies.	1.1523676483189724
Zanamivir and GS4071/GS4104 are well tolerated without adverse reactions after topic and oral administration, respectively.	0.7576587031437404
Resistant viral strains have been found in cell culture in the presence of both drugs, but the frequency of resistance emergence during clinical use is unclear.	1.2206502815213143
To date, the biggest recognizable disadvantage of neuraminidase inhibitors and Amantadin/Rimantadin alike is that they need to be given within 30-48 h after onset of symptoms, but seeking medical attention at this stage of infection does not seem to be realistic in medical practice.	0.9325470095301859
As neuraminidase inhibitors up to now could mainly be assessed by experimental data, specifically performed clinical trials will have to prove the positive influence of these drugs on the morbidity, course of infection, and mortality of high risk persons when administered for prophylaxis as well as for therapy.	1.1582770922144683
Background and purpose: Without recanalisation, acute basilar artery (BA) occlusion has a mortality of 90 %, which is reduced to 50 % if recanalisation is achieved.	1.2609785034193384
Fast diagnosis of BA occlusion is necessary in order to start thrombolytic therapy without delay.	0.8298507223080616
We wanted to assess the role of CT angiography (CTA) in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected acute BA occlusion.	1.2043313145703258
25 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD, 62  +/-  9 years) and 18 subjects free from cardiovascular disease (28  +/-  9 years) were tested on a cycle ergometer using a graded incremental test protocol: a) in the common upright position, b) as dynamic stress echocardiography in a semi-supine position.	1.1413300553883263
Whereas no relevant differences could be detected between the two conditions for the healthy subjects concerning heart rate, blood pressure, and rate-pressure product (2 x 3 ANOVA, t-test with -adjustment), the CHD patients showed both significantly higher heart rates as well as a significantly higher rate-pressure product (50 W: 15 300  +/-  2973 mmHg/min vs. 13 822  +/-  3042 mmHg/min; 75 W: 18 028  +/-  3479 mmHg/min vs 16 337  +/-  2619 mmHg/min) on equivalent stages during stress echocardiography if compared to the sitting position.	1.1573981524997026
There were no differences for systolic blood pressure in this group; the diastolic values were higher in the sitting position at rest and during 50 W. Lactate concentrations (determined only in the healthy subjects) were significantly higher on all stages during dynamic stress echocardiography.	1.201177724466699
The workload at the individual anaerobic threshold (IAT) was significantly lower.	1.126967313204372
A new stoechiometric mixture of 27% dicalcium-phosphate (DCPA) and 73% tetra-calcium-phosphate (TTCP) can be prepared with water intraoperatively to a paste that subsequently sets to a structurally stabile implant composed of hydroxyapatite (HA).	0.9220696976486087
Primary setting time is about 20 min; pH during setting ranges from 6.5 to 8.5.	1.1069005822017404
There is no relevant curing heat or expansion or contraction.	0.8213924476150667
Compressive strength is about 50 MPa, tensile strength about 8 MPa.	0.7869884536523086
Over a period of about 4 h in physiological milieu, the cement converts to hydroxyapatite.	1.0201779176650811
This product is no longer redissolvable  in normal body fluid.	0.886831595222239
This cement can be used for non-load-bearing applications especially in craniofacial bone surgery.	0.8719794869608797
Cranial defects due to tumour or trauma as well as deficits in the facial skeleton may be reconstructed using this new biomaterial.	0.9792224895114682
In nine of ten patients we used the hydroxyapatite cement successfully for reconstructions in the craniofacial area.	0.8892890359495385
Fluid control of the operation field and implant site is extremely important and sometimes difficult to achieve.	1.0659729050356601
Further applications could be all non-load-bearing augmentations such as filling of blocked paranasal sinuses, of dentoalveolar cysts and defects following dental apectomy or fixation of implanted hearing-aid electrodes.	0.8532724254174745
The perspectives for the hydroxyapatite cement include its application as a carrier for osteogenic protein preparations, especially because of its isothermic reaction and intrinsic osteoconductive characteristics.	0.9747273127555317
We present a non-invasive epilepsy surgery protocol, which includes EEG-video-monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal positron emission tomography (PET) and ictal single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT).	1.0260724365627634
According to this non-invasive protocol 50 of 173 patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy underwent resective surgery.	0.8836826266898035
The localization of the epileptogenic zone was based on the congruence of the localizing results of EEG-video-montoring, MRI, interictal PET and ictal SPECT.	0.9019856088318379
46 (92%) of the patients had temporal and 4 (8%) had extratemporal epilepsies.	1.2833042673066102
78% (n=39) of all patients operated according to our non-invasive protocol were postoperatively completely or almost seizure free.	1.2373859092086097
Extramesiotemporal resections could be carried out without invasive EEG-recording if the epileptogenic zone was not adjacent to the eloquent cortex.	0.8046955904800157
We conclude from our results that in a considerable number of patients with medically intractable particularly temporal focal epilepsies, resective epilepsy surgery can be based on non-invasive EEG-evaluations and the risk of invasive recordings can be avoided.	1.0123911593539243
Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) is mostly associated with a pancreatic-A-cell-glucagonoma and is considered to be a well-defined cutaneous paraneoplastic syndrome.	1.142495169201952
We report on a 74-year old female who atypically developed a NME after surgical treatment of a rectal adenocarcinoma.	1.2301630180110914
Continuous staging and laboratory investigation over four years gave no evidence of any metastasis or further neoplasia.	0.9427510164903686
Hair samples and perspiration collected from long term drug addicts (n = 18) under constant methadone treatment were investigated.	0.9593979020265672
Hair segments representing the individual hair growth of 4 weeks were analyzed for methadone, opiates and cocaine by GC/MS.	0.9416287765313074
The results obtained from the transdermal collection devices confirmed the presence of drug substances in variable amounts on the skin surface, methadone being the main analyte.	1.1225492409198399
The perspiration test period lasted for 4 days.	0.7239052569716472
For six persons illicit drugs similar to those in the corresponding hair samples were found.	0.8349730598713092
Overall, a poor relationship (r = 0,602) was found between the methadone dose under steady state conditions and the methadone level in hair.	1.2583007406774638
The results are discussed in the light of pharmacokinetic aspects, drug uptake by perspiration and forensic interpretation.	1.0887986864459562
Bilateral carotid artery dissection is a rare and unusual complication of blunt cervicofacial trauma.	0.9565181900245153
The diagnosis of a carotid injury is rarely suspected in trauma patients with neurological deficits.	1.0581165448746077
Neurological symptoms may develop in a delayed fashion.	0.8186479652775547
Angiography should be considered in trauma patients with hemiplegia and a normal mental status and in patients with blunt cervical trauma with an abnormal neurological examination.	1.186403766278726
Initial heparinisation can prevent arterial thrombosis and neurological deterioration.	0.7673045607170091
The authors report their findings which are based on 10 years of interdisciplinary cooperation in the treatment of chronic pain patients.	1.1063825547319295
They point out the practical use of their findings in daily practice.	0.8911173902803926
Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined by increased intraabdominal pressure above 20 mmHg with increased pulmonary peak pressure and oliguria.	0.9299142319316884
In primary abdominal compartment syndrome the increased intraabdominal pressure is caused directly by peritonitis, ileus or abdominal and pelvic trauma.	0.8969173371378966
Secondary compartment syndrome is a result of forced closure of the abdominal wall after abdominal surgery.	0.9704050901813711
The effects are decreased cardiac output, pulmonary atelectasis, oliguria to anuria and hepatic as well as intestinal reduction of perfusion.	0.9536818876115568
Effective monitoring is done by standardised measuring of urinary bladder pressure.	0.8488413264476987
Normal values are between 0 and 7 cm H2O, after elective laparotomies 5-12 cm H20.	1.1048632767571331
Above 25 cm H20 they are definitely pathological.	0.7285292156851302
For the prevention and therapy of manifested abdominal compartment syndrome the application of a laparostomy using a resorbable mesh is recommended.	1.0552127570594874
Between 1988 and 1999 we applied a laparostomy to lower the intraabdominal pressure in 377 patients.	0.9355727706422
In 16 % of the cases it was indicated by primary abdominal compartment syndrome with a bladder pressure of 31  +/-  4 cm H20 preoperatively, which could be lowered to 17  +/-  4 cm H20 by laparostomy.	1.1383393979427872
An early reconstruction of the abdominal wall could be performed in 18 % of the cases.	1.1339081987502797
Conclusions: The abdominal compartment syndrome is an often underestimated problem in abdominal surgery involving multiple organ systems.	1.0040386729282975
The temporary laparostomy lowering intraabdominal pressure rather than a forced closure of the abdominal wall should be used in all circumstances.	0.9900474693579011
In general, assessment of the correct placement of a central venous catheter is performed by fluoroscopy or by postinsertional chest X-ray.	0.8969613980215925
We report a case of intraaortic malposition of a central venous catheter in a 59-year-old male patient that was not detectable in chest films.	0.9888536536858293
Further exploration of this patient revealed a left-sided superior vena cava.	0.8049035137662729
Definition of the problem: In 1997, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) was performed in 138.001 cases in Germany.	0.9707288701662229
The standard indications, single vessel disease and badly controlled angina, are more and more extended to multivessel disease with and without severe angina, unstable or preinfarction angina, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) itself.	0.9778039143080128
Dilating asymptomatic stenoses of more than 70-80% is a widely used indication, intending prophylaxis of complete occlusion and AMI.	1.1284123878459307
Actually there is no generally accepted guideline for the different new indications, conservative versus invasive treatment schedule.	0.9764442758246135
It is difficult for the patient to get appropriate information before his decision between mechanical procedures and conservative methods; authentic informed consent actually seems to be in a very bad position.	1.153375571157228
In 1992 the working group called "Arbeitsgemeinschaft leitender kardiologischer Krankenhausärzte (ALKK)" decided to start a registry of all PTCA procedures, in order to gain knowledge about the present status of PTCA in Germany.	1.0517226440536396
Up to March 1999, 198.608 PTCA are logged.	0.6586199024218756
Two children developed multiple melanocytic naevi after polychemotherapy administered for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in one and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the other.	0.9837089700678079
Induction of naevi does not seem to be related to specific agents used in chemotherapy, but rather to the immunosuppression resulting from multiple-agent chemotherapy.	0.9323319586788469
There are reports in the literature of both intrinsically and iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients who have developed multiple melanocytic naevi.	1.0290757062604556
Many small randomized studies with <beta>-blockers in patients with chronic heart failure have been published in recent years.	0.9321159796892284
A large meta-analysis by Lechat combining 18 studies with 3023 patients showed a 32% reduction in mortality in patients treated with <beta>-blockers.	0.8391787317786323
Mortality and hospitalization together were reduced by 37%.	0.7297527103222005
In 1998 two large randomized trials investigating Bisoprolol (CIBIS II) and Metoprolol (MERIT-HF) were finished.	0.9924263381390935
Both studies show a significant reduction in mortality in patients treated with <beta>-blockers.	0.7574281237943465
The ongoing COMET study compares <beta>1-selective blockers like metoprolol with vasodilatative <beta>-blockers like carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure.	0.9169566874454183
Large clinical registries demonstrate clinical practicability of <beta>-blocker treatment of patients with chronic heart failure.	0.8676738743088243
All patients with stabel chronic heart failure ought to be treated with <beta>-blockers additional to a basic therapy with ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis.	1.016227907268648
The <beta>-blocker therapy regimen is to start with low doses and to increase the dose carefully:"Start low and go slow".	0.9537781324868347
Purpose: Cardiac imaging includes determination of the size and structure of the cardiac chambers, valves, great vessels and the coronary arteries, chamber and valvular function, myocardial perfusion, viability and metabolism.	1.1005102274761656
A 52-year-old patient presenting with severe thoracic pain of more than 30 minutes duration and ST-segment elevation > 1 mV in leads V1-3 was given 100 mg rt-PA. With persisting thoracic pain and ST-segment elevation, coronary angiography was performed 90 minutes after administration of thrombolytic therapy.	1.0740013598042275
Surprisingly, angiography revealed normal coronary arteries in presence of marked hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	1.0544279404776953
New onset of thoracic pain after four hours led to chest raiograph demonstrating increased mediastinal widening and new pleural effusion as compared to a baseline chest film prior to rt-PA. Spiral computed tomography revealed overt Type B aortic dissection with an intimal flap and communication distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with signs of a mediastinal hematoma.	1.0272532045685898
Immediate cardiac surgery with replacement of the dissected aortic segment was successfully performed.	0.8057119426667765
A literature review revealed 4% of aortic dissection to present with electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial infarction and 13% to have concomitant coronary artery disease; moreover 34 cases of aortic dissection were misdiagnosed as infarction and subjected to thrombolytic agents with a mortality of 64% underlining the importance of exclusion of dissection prior to thombolytic therapy.	1.119673679461439
Between 1984 and 1996 we performed a Mason gastroplasty for the treatment of morbid obesity: 14 patients (average age 40 (26-48) years, body mass index (BMI) 48 (37-71) kg/m2, excessive body weight 67 (41-116) kg).	1.0237731974563968
Since the end of 1996 we now apply adjustable laparoscopic gastric banding (lab band): 73 patients (average age 39 (22-64) years, BMI 45 (32-69) kg/m2, excessive body weight 66 (41-116) kg).	1.0258827838336697
We compared the early and late results of both methods.	0.9351971287599813
Early results: no relevant morbidity or mortality for neither method.	1.0783333473218217
Late/intermediate results: reoperation rate for both methods 15 %.	1.1044166588656987
After an average of 3.7 years the excessive body weight loss (EWL) for gastroplasty was 54 (22-96) %.	1.2356329680774176
The EWL after lab band for 24 patients after 12 months was 47 (11-127) % and for 8 patients after 18 months 51 (28-139) %.	1.357709960874028
Since the introduction of the lap band the number of bariatric operations has greatly increased.	0.8097009719289916
Nevertheless, the perioperative complication rate has remained low, and the long-term outcome is similar for both methods.	1.3635773767636203
We investigated the relationships between prolactin (PRL) levels and antibody occurrence in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).	0.8117815797272759
No significant association between PRL levels and the majority of the autoantibodies studied (anti-U1 RNP, anti-rRNP, anti-Sm, anti-dsDNA, anti-DNP, auto-LCA, anti-EACA) could be confirmed (P > 0.05), anti-Ro/SSA antibodies being an exception.	1.1243001823488366
Our results showed significantly increased frequencies of these antibodies in the group of female SLE patients with normal PRL levels (< 20 µg/L): anti Ro/SSA in 53% (P < 0.025, 2 = 5.80, RR = 4.0) and anti-Ro/SSA + anti-Ro/La in 60% (P < 0.05, 2 = 4.05) compared with female SLE patients with hyperprolactinemia.	1.131869668579871
An echinococcal cyst of the heart is a rare cause of acute cardiac tamponade.	1.015050819771109
We report on a 24 year old male from the Kosovo who was brought in an emergency state from a provincial hospital complaining of severe dyspnea, thoracic pain, dizziness, and a short period of unconsciousness.	1.2168081204081538
Surgical decompression had to be performed urgently, because the pericardium could not be punctuated due to the position of the hydatid cyst.	1.0956541111509057
We report on the case of a 51-year-old female patient who had been suffering from multiple itching nodules for 3 years.	1.071398628232959
Some of these lesions were classified clinically and histologically as keratoacanthomas (KA), whereas the multiple smaller nodules were found on histological examination to be either early stage KA or lesions of prurigo simplex subacuta.	1.1929341584904996
In two KA, HPV subtype 2 was identified by in situ hybridization.	0.9430611727616149
Treatment with etretinate resulted in remission of the fully developed KA and reduced the occurrence of new ones.	0.8503205601686037
The outbreak of multiple KA in our patient resembled a rare subtype described by Witten and Zak.	0.9015759834228998
Postclinical follow-up for 28 months to date has revealed that the KA arise from the subacute prurigo lesions.	1.042456237585709
This mode of prurigo-dependent KA development has not previously been reported.	0.8461382054380563
We describe a rare case of a papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve occurring simultaneously with a cystic tumor (a so-called mesothelioma) of the atrioventricular nodal region.	1.3320402864108645
At autopsy the tumor was found to prolapse into and occlude the right coronary ostium, leading to an acute, recurring myocardial infarction.	1.1810060665520734
Histological examination of the grossly unremarkable conduction system of the heart revealed a cystic tumor in the region of the atrioventricular node.	1.0544404383469521
To our knowledge, this is the first report of coexistence of these two rare cardiac tumors.	0.8788754431322989
Although still rare, pregnancy and delivery in women with spinal cord injuries is becoming more frequent (Table 2).	1.0306020050311355
In 85%-90% of patients with lesions above T6 symptoms of autonomic hyperreflexia (Table 1), especially paroxysmal and excessive increases in arterial blood pressure, may occur.	1.2117122084408598
In anaesthesising a 31-year-old paraplegic primigravida with a complete transverse spinal lesion at T4 for an elective caesarean section, no indication of hypertonic cardiovascular dysregulation either intra- or postoperatively was observed after repeated epidural administration of bupivacaine.	1.0719338484719716
Distinct intraoperative spasticity of the abdominal wall muscles was, however, not influenced by the dosages selected.	1.0674886726127046
Repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless method to induce transient activation in circumscript regions of the human cortex.	0.9845563875011945
In contrast to TMS with single pulses rTMS allows a more effective stimulation of association cortex and temporary interference with the proper functioning of stimulated areas.	0.9564512388567807
Possible applications for examination of the functional anatomy of language lateralisation, memory functions and visual perception are discussed.	0.9762790134372784
Possible therapeutic for movement  disorders and depression are discussed.	0.8110797586447812
On the basis of theoretical considerations  and current experience rTMS induced epileptogenic effects are discussed and safety  recommendations are given.	1.0156775575783705
An unusual shaped piece of skin was found in the oral cavity of a woman who had been stabbed to death.	1.0150805310366118
Physical examination of the victim's numerous male acquaintances revealed one to have an injury of the same shape on the ventral surface of the left ring finger.	1.109512801618109
Molecular biological investigations showed that this suspect and the piece of skin exhibited corresponding DNA patterns (frequency 1 : 700 000).	0.8294870331569512
This case underlines the importance of physical examination as a preliminary to further detailed investigation.	0.8025819219703288
Nineteen men with post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence grade II and III (mean follow-up 12.7 months) underwent periurethral injections of collagen.	1.1060990457845912
In all, 37 procedures were performed; 58 % of the patients underwent the procedure at least twice.	1.1237466584287306
A mean of 16 ml collagen was injected.	0.796923761220484
The results were successful directly after injections, leaving all patients continent; however, after 3 months the treatment failed and all patients returned to their incontinence status as seen preoperatively.	1.2137266560019762
No perioperative complications were noted.	0.6554691626246537
Despite the simple and safe nature of this procedure, men with severe postoperative stress incontinence do not benefit from periurethral collagen injections.	0.9023136757129805
After a short review of the literature, some aspects of the psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania with an adolescent patient are presented that up to now have not been described in great detail.	1.1861945339807987
Against the backdrop of previous fears of being abandoned, the patient feels threatened that while coping with the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness she will be dropped once again.	1.0312079657803501
This psychodynamically oriented therapy makes it possible for the patient to accept and verbalize the corresponding feelings in a relationship that gives a feeling of security.	1.0121558491562996
Therefore, the symptoms that previously served the purpose of regulating diffuse inner tensions and fears may be abandoned.	1.1120040920839829
According to sonographic criteria, 55 patients underwent surgical treatment with mobilisation in a lower leg plaster or conservative treatment with early mobilisation in heel pad (3 cm) shoes when an acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) was diagnosed.	1.1367421911143447
The follow-up period in 51 patients was 2.4 years (operated group = 28 patients, conservative group = 23 patients) with clinical examination and testing of isokinetic muscle strength in knee joint flexion.	1.298184133683374
After surgical treatment, minor wound infections occurred in 10.6 %.	0.8585480036739791
Reruptures occurred in 13 % of the conservative group.	1.2395658019874571
Following conservative treatment, the rate of stress-related achillodynia was significantly higher (P = 0.019).	0.9560710877598295
In the operated group mean isokinetic muscle strength was 13.7 % lower than in the uninvolved leg and decreased significantly with non-operative treatment to 75.3 % (P = 0.012).	1.1013698965375824
We recommend surgical treatment of acute ATR.	1.059434362935209
The indications for conservative treatment depend on the extent of the rupture (measured by ultrasound in the equinus position), the desired level of daily activity and the patient's degree of compliance.	1.1795443837455808
"MicroSort" promises to become a reliable method for preselecting the sex of our children.	0.8816569523038564
As so many innovations in the field of assisted reproductive technology, however, sex selection raises difficult moral and legal issues.	1.0520887901340727
In this paper, we focus on the question whether or not sex selection calls for a legal ban.	1.0217514345433087
Since it does not seem to imply any serious harm to others, we argue in favour of the legalization of sex selection.	0.9987811823076062
Acute limb ischemia is an emergency which regularly requires operative treatment in departments of general surgery.	0.973581324393525
In about 70 % of cases there is an embolic reason for acute ischemia.	1.244799514666159
In the majority of cases urgent operative desobliteration is required to guarantee limb salvage.	0.9433977400174614
The introduction of balloon catheters reduced the surgical trauma significantly in cases of long secondary thromboses.	0.9778566449952412
More complex procedures are required in patients with preexisting chronic arterial occlusive disease.	0.8787662873415318
The mortality of these emergency operations is still 10-20 % with a limb salvage rate of 80-90 %.	1.158894004276485
Infectious complications related to acquired neutropenia have become a major medical issue, often requiring intensive care management.	0.9441681820388593
These infections may be lethal if empirical broad-spectrum treatment is not rapidly started at the first sign of infection (i.e., fever), and this concept is now widely recognized a standard practice.	1.1095220024205747
However, the choice of antibiotics has generated considerable controversy for nearly 25 years.	0.9751491195536418
After reviewing some particularities of infection in neutropenic patients, this paper will discuss the options and present comprehensive algorithm for non-infectious diseases specialist, including recent advances about early IV-oral switch and the selection of low risk patients for outpatient management.	1.1069388805467182
Background: It has been suggested that inflammatory processes play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS).	1.1109164322059537
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a classic acute phase protein.	0.7906376128625364
It is yet unclear whether, in addition to established markers as troponin T (TnT), determination of CRP in patients admitted for ACS contributes significantly to the diagnosis and prognosis of ACS.Patients and Methods: We investigated 50 patients with ACS (59.4 SD 13.9 years) in the first hour after admission and 4-24h later with respect to TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).	1.1926413776093747
Fifty percent of the patients were classified as having unstable angina retrospectively.	1.1280695791514068
All patients were followed in the 6 weeks post discharge regarding death and recurrent ACS.Results: The cumulative event rate at 6 weeks after discharge was 62.5% for patients being CRP and TnT positive compared to 35.3% in TnT positive and CRP negative patients.	1.2104173881474036
In TnT negative patients a positive CRP test predicted 33.3% of events and 28.8% of patients negative for CRP and TnT had events at 42 days post discharge.	1.1786977314380962
Logistic regression analysis regarding the primary endpoint including TnT and CRP (4-24h values), age, gender and diagnosis resulted in independent prediction of ACS or death by TnT (cutoff 0.1µg/L, p=0.048, odds ratio=7.5) and CRP (cutoff 0.862mg/dL, p=0.026, odds ratio=5.3).	1.051416656688573
Sensitivity/specificity for AMI diagnosis were 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP 4-24h later.Conclusions: Besides TnT, high sensitivity CRP determination has no additional value for early AMI diagnosis.	1.2487946627366104
The prognosis of these patients during the first 24 hours is significantly and independently predicted by CRP measurements in addition to troponin T.	1.2393128433289855
Purpose: Evaluation of clinical and morphological results in 44 consecutive patients with 45 aneurysms of the posterior circulation.	1.2304344436677876
Following coronary artery bypass grafting repeat ischemia mandatory for reintervention occurs in 2 to 30% of cases, depending mainly on graft age.	1.0900299698629086
Selection of a suitable strategy for revascularisation - transcatheter angioplasty or reoperation - depends on various parameters including coronary morphology, left ventricular performance, comorbidity and availability of graft material.	1.0364192342775986
Catheterbased interventions on saphenous vein bypass grafts are feasible, but lower primary success rates and a higher incidence of restenosis - compared with native coronary arteries - have to be expected.	1.182139623705389
Repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations are associated with a significantly higher perioperative morbidity and mortality, patency rates are lower and late clinical outcome is worse than in primary surgery.	0.9643104190220457
We report on a patient who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 4 years ago revealing a high grade ostial stenosis in a jump-graft supplying RCA, LAD and Cx sequentially, making reintervention necessary.	1.062887198106032
As a prerequisite serial balloon angioplasty of two native vessels was performed prior to ostial intervention.	0.8133940028742902
Intravascular-ultrasound guided directional coronary atherectomy was performed with good primary and long-term result.	1.0532071182857925
Our case demonstrates that, if all relevant clinical parameters and different therapeutic options are taken into account, complex transcatheter angioplasty procedures are feasible and associated with a reasonable amount of risk, thus avoiding repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations.	1.1749496867353932
In recent years the indication for a mastectomy for breast cancer has been increasingly restricted.	1.0580921192740185
The use of plastic reconstructive techniques enhances the rate of breast-conserving therapy even for large breast tumors with excellent cosmetic results and oncological safety.	0.9754530458293333
The breast-to-tumor ratio and locally complete resection with free tumor margins of 1-2 cm are the most important factors in breast-conserving surgery.	1.1300155951935495
Different techniques of reduction mammoplasty within the concept of oncological breast surgery not only allow large tumors in large breasts to be resected, but also relatively large tumors in normal sized or even smaller breasts to be resected.	1.0750116300378008
Other advantages are the reduction of breast size and therefore target volume before postoperative radiation procedures as well as in cancer prophylaxis and risk reduction by reducing ipsi- and contralateral breast tissue.	1.0934675816435457
Reduction mammoplasty techniques with different resection areas have to be selected for individual tumor locations.	0.883695734806122
The best symmetry is achieved by bilateral mammoplasty in a one step procedure with lumpectomy and axillary dissection.	0.8595957276652322
Oncoplastic or reconstructive surgery in the target breast is often followed by procedures to improve symmetry by contralateral reduction.	0.9648026890458092
Whenever possible, mammoplasty techniques with minimal scarring should be chosen out of a variety of reduction procedures.	0.8667283186376548
Epidermoid cysts are rare, benign tumors of the testis or, less frequently, the inguinal cord.	1.1262644948001481
Generally, they affect males between 10 and 39 years.	1.0934802767440208
In newborns they are rare.	0.657371848958304
We report on a newborn with an epidermoid cyst of the right testis that had been diagnosed in utero and was removed with preservation of the testicle.	1.11110468109487
Although there are various published descriptions of the dura mater spinalis [4, 7, 9, 11, 16], some points relating to the texture of the collagen fibres in the dura have still not been adequately explained.	1.1686043100939758
In this study the orientation of the collagen fibril bundles was revealed with the aid of scanning electron microscopy, and our observations have yielded new insights into the three-dimensional structure of the human dura mater spinalis.	1.1257018624016895
Reconstructive plastic surgery is not always possible or advisable for nasal defects following tumor resections.	0.9501547326622872
Facial prostheses offer an alternative therapy.	0.5032250212717285
Since 1991, 37 patients with nasal defects after tumor surgery were treated in the Berlin Center of Facial Prostheses: 28 received "soft" silicone facial prostheses and 9 "solid" polymethylmetacrylate facial prostheses.	1.0740140659181643
In 35 patients protheses were bone-anchored: Brånemark implants were used in 12 patients and an Epitec frame construction in 23 patients.	1.044614168604847
Glue-on prostheses were applied to only two patients.	0.815265857073994
No intraoperative complications occurred at implant insertion.	0.7034945715714365
During following visits only minor inflammations were observed around implants and were treated locally.	0.8625608261880985
The implant success rate was 78% for the Brånemark implants (89.7% in non- radiated areas and 50% in radiated areas) and 100% in radiated and non-radiated areas for the Epitec system.	1.2922351880145593
Our investigation shows that given the right indication, the bone-anchored facial prosthesis is safe, cosmetically acceptable, uncomplicated and not stressful for the patient.	0.9806353866583771
We report a patient who developed malignant transformation of a cellular blue nevus.	0.9176527057165742
At the age of 19 years the congenital, pigmented tumor on the left buttock was histopathologically diagnosed as cellular blue nevus.	0.9947516992146404
Thirty years later the tumor dramatically increased in size, involving the entire left buttock within several months.	0.9346764208048454
Multiple biopsies revealed the presence of a cellular blue nevus within the papillary dermis and an invasive, pleomorphic pigmented sarcoma in the depth of the tissue spreading into subcutis and skeletal muscle.	0.9298606999347565
Both benign and malignant cells were S100+, vimentin+ and HMB-45+, but only the malignant tumor cells stained positive for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen.	1.058411401698724
General examination disclosed multiple metastases in the paraaortal lymph nodes and the retroperitoneum as well as a single brain metastasis.	1.1531968620353095
Despite palliative therapy with ionizing radiation and chemotherapy, the patient developed generalized metastases and died within weeks.	1.21247681559772
This case clearly confirms that cellular blue nevi have the potential for malignant transformation and that the malignant variant may behave aggressively just as a malignant melanoma.	1.0150514495071297
(Acitve alert) Hypnosis and sports in the psychotherapy of out-patients with anxiety disorders.	0.8484263723511484
A process-oriented approach combining hypnotherapeutic with cognitive-behavioral concepts within a systemic model of psychotherapy for the outpatient treatment of anxiety disorders is outlined.	1.0148859436004563
The use of active alert hypnosis (hypnosis by bicycle ergometry) combining elements of hypnotherapy and sports therapy is adapted to patients characteristics and the process of therapy.	0.9042265192511338
Relaxation and active alert hypnosis and different sports are used as methods of cue exposure respectively training of competence.	0.8989851167200531
The treatment is sequentially structured (motivation, symptom-control, conflict, integration).	0.8925618374298104
Active alert hypnosis catalyses the therapeutic process within the stage of symptom-control (reduction of anxiety and depression) and of conflict (modifcation of intrapsychic conficts or traumata within trance induced by physical exercises).	0.9885903518900389
Therapeutic goals and techniques for each stage are specified by case examples.	0.8201792862221178
Endoscopic techniques in the spine have become possible with improvements in instrumentation.	0.9088695830799268
Other minimally invasive techniques are limited to intradiscal surgery, not at the site of the pathology.	1.044968781891687
With the transforaminal approach, treatment in the epidural space has become possible.	1.0465030172785001
In a pilot study we investigated the pitfalls, risks, and complications of transforaminal surgery.	0.9332825056166311
Patient satisfaction and acceptance of the method were documented.	0.9947790007910486
Some 27 patients with disk pathologies at the level of the disk space, excluding extremely medially situated herniations, were treated.	0.9571278929039555
We used a standard posterolateral approach under local anesthesia combined with spinal morphine anesthesia.	0.9252714604509037
The treated levels were L5/S1 (11), L4/5 (12), L3/4 (3), and L2/3 (1).	1.2744412868012676
All areas could be reached by this approach.	0.7047081368336049
One procedure had to be abandoned because of instrumentation problems.	0.7706396940133472
One patient had recurrent disk herniation and had an open procedure.	0.8282044023372781
Two patients were reoperated because of persistent pain.	0.9244744936797071
No signs of reherniation could be found in these cases, but there was swelling of the nerve root and minimal scarring.	1.0745079780452842
Minor complications were trancient root paresthesia and headache postoperatively.	0.6801083914324134
Postoperative MRI or CT scans revealed only little scar tissue.	0.8177878660526825
This impression was supported in the open revisions we performed.	0.8444579199738539
Clinical acceptance of the procedure was excellent and the patients recovered very quickly.	1.1733588016617542
Endoscopic transforaminal surgery has a considerable learning curve, even when surgeons are acquainted with the posterolateral approach and arthroskopic surgery.	1.0194194213455778
However, it offers a good alternative to other minimally invasive procedures and has to be seen as a good alternative to open disk surgery, too.	1.2551979623075766
Quality management in a rescue coordination center (RCC) not only needs an evaluation of quantitative parameters (such as time intervals), but also an examination of the correlation between suspected and real found emergency situations.	1.1249222496730331
For that purpose it is necessary to request feedback informations about kind and severity of the emergency situation from the emergency medical team working at the scene.	1.0436967695645847
The case of a fatal catheter-induced cardiac tamponade in a 81-year-old woman is reported.	1.0169785453757256
Death occurred after a delay of 18 h following placement of a central venous catheter for parenteral feeding.	0.9093516141542368
According to the clinical and histological findings, placement of the catheter caused a primary perforation.	1.129894707522522
Confirmation of proper placement of the catheter tip was not performed.	0.8273512536220587
Despite clinical indications on the forthcoming complication, sufficient emergency treatment was not carried out.	0.9284311526771806
Background: The rapid integration of new technology into ophthalmologic practice, e. g. LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis), is associated with new complications.	1.129395785241454
The limitations of the new technology cannot be precisely determined.	0.9058273764987341
During lamellar cuts with microkeratomes intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations occur.	0.7590861415683903
The IOP elevation during the lamellar cut cannot be determined by conventional tonometry.	0.8137830636476177
Due to its superior soft tissue contrast conventional MRI is the imaging method of  choice in the evaluation of ankle joint disorders.	0.9585593958231812
Conventional MR imaging can accurately demonstrate normal or acutely injured ligaments; however, in subacute and chronic injury joint fluid necessary for delineation of injured ligaments is absent and MR arthrography should be performed.	0.9790579580218836
MR arthrography uses the intraarticular injection of contrast material to distend the joint, yielding improved discrimination of intraarticular structures.	0.8505211000491422
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in the staging of osteochondritis dissecans, since in cases of unstable lesions tracking of contrast material into the interface can be more easily demonstrated.	1.0311414118215596
Finally, high contrast and joint distension by MR arthrography improves the detection of intraarticular loose bodies, which often require surgery.	1.2238266370502304
MR arthrography, although invasive, may provide additional information in various ankle joint disorders.	1.0643461388971311
Several studies have demonstrated an association Chlamydia pneumoniae with coronary artery disease, suggesting that infection with C. pneumoniae increases the risk for coronary artery disease by factor 2 or more.	1.1612852260143511
Since atherosclerosis is considered to be a chronic inflammatory process, these data would fit into the response-to-injury hypothesis of atherosclerosis rather than representing a completely novel concept.	1.0623047228986593
Several pathomechanisms as increased cytokine synthesis, proliferative and proaggregatory effects could transmit the effects of chronic C. pneumoniae infection.	0.9249809660727465
