There was a reorientation from the middle of the 1970 s as a result of more effective therapeutic possibilities.	1.1063150845400407
A variety of complementary institutions, outpatient and partly inpatient therapies, which were recommended by the "Psychiatrie-Enquête", started to be realized.	1.0727836964974122
Smaller units and different models of integration of psychiatric care, such as building the hospital next to a general hospital or psychiatric wards within a general hospital, became relevant criteria for planning the construction of psychiatric hospitals, as did the integration into the community and the city.	1.1016355996718432
Principles of organization like the construction of a communicative quiet inner room, or grading the rooms from public to private, were structurally integrated.	0.9804583134422261
Specific structural requirements for the construction and design of psychiatric hospitals should be evaluated in more detail by post-occupancy methods.	1.0170478963198324
The coronal incision is a versatile approach to midface or skull base fractures.	0.7399259474057099
It allows the open reduction of complex fracture sites and facilitates canthopexy, marginotomy or calvarian bone harvesting.	0.844499895522504
By this method, primary treatment can be optimised and the rate of secondary corrective surgery can be reduced.	0.9220402269946736
All trauma patients who underwent this kind of intervention were re-examined to check functional and aesthetic results.	0.898450588679856
The complication rate was low and the advantages of these techniques are evident, so that it is suggested that the indication for this operative approach should be extended.	1.0729057897296042
One case of a newly described, rare odontogenic tumor is reported.	1.1697374225626738
A literature review of 19 cases lends support to the odontogenic origin and metastatic capability, both regionally and distantly, of the clear cell odontogenic tumor.	1.140726401248846
We conclude that this tumor is malignant, with a tendency to recur locally after surgery.	1.1859940046072126
It requires an aggressive surgical approach and should be referred to as a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma.	0.9257699967491474
In our patient we saw a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma and a squamous cell carcinoma, both with regional lymph node metastasis.	1.0485592357825606
The histological differentiation of this type of tumor from other clear cell tumors is difficult.	0.8792918192773382
As the elderly segment of our population expands, there is an increase of therapeutic problems considering this age group.	1.0014509103306384
The elderly patient is generally susceptible to infections because of the decline in host defense mechanisms that occurs with aging, and the underlying chronic diseases of these patients.	1.1543837224610576
Increasing numbers of elderly people are being treated in hospitals and are additionally at particular risk of acquiring nosocomial infections with antibiotic-resistant organisms.	0.9627130644989722
This article focuses on the epidemiological considerations, risk factors, types of infections that occur in elderly patients, and the guidelines for empiric therapy.	0.983186090117828
The most common infections of the elderly are respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and skin and soft tissue infection.	1.1759445001725444
Empirical therapy should be broader in spectrum for elderly patients since the variety of infecting bacteria tends to be greater and the choice of antimicrobial therapy must be based on risk stratification (age, medical illnesses, and severity of presentation).	1.0139749030406817
Many additional aspects, e.g., route of administration, drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, drug toxicity and drug-drug interactions, compliance, and multiple underlying diseases (e.g., renal failure) must be considered in the rational selection of antibiotic regimen.	1.144777376213682
We present long-term results (minimum follow-up 5 years) in 145 patients with advanced non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, who underwent radical retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (RPLA) after chemotherapy.	1.2683019771440467
We correlated patients' outcomes (death of disease) to different kinds of chemotherapy and to intraoperative findings.	1.0478064150063608
We found that patients who were treated by a modified Einhorn scheme with cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin have a good prognosis.	0.9641940323503836
In all, 90 % showed no evidence of disease (NED).	1.121839716119259
The NED rate was significantly lower in patients who were treated by sequential alternative chemotherapy (DOD = 37 %).We determined the following prognostic factors which predict a poor outcome:...	1.2315398038328256
Follow-up studies after stent implantation of native coronary arteries have reported reduced rates of angiographic restenosis.	0.9845957217782249
In contrast, stent implantation in the treatment of obstructive disease of coronary artery bypass grafts is complicated by higher restenosis rates.	1.1264657188368747
We sought to determine, if different predictors contribute to the high restenosis rate following stent implantation of coronary artery bypass grafts.	1.195786806046591
We investigated long-term angiographic outcome of 205 stent implantations performed in 177 patients.	0.8987513793254555
Multivariate analysis correlated clinical, procedural and angiographic variables with the incidence of angiographic restenosis defined as diameter stenosis >50% at follow-up.	1.0306518204264987
Angiographic restenosis was observed in 34% of lesions treated.	1.2080513020489636
Multiple logistic regression analysis defined diabetes mellitus (OR 6.89, CI2.41-9.69), graft recanalization (OR 2.69, CI 1.08-6.63), lesion at the aortic anastomosis (OR6.98, CI2.76-19.25), lesion at the coronary anastomosis (OR 2.95, CI1.18-7.49), high diameter stenosis after stent placement (OR 7.01, CI 2.64-15.71), placement of long stents (OR2.78, CI1.11-7.36) and implantation of more than one stent (OR7.34, CI2.08-20.15) as independent predictors of graft in-stent restenosis.	1.2148719812051032
Critical consideration of these variables may help to identify patients who are poor candidates for stent implantation and who may benefit from different interventional approaches.	1.0801165083135906
To compare the conventional 2-D, the simulator-guided semi-3-D and the recently developed CT-guided 3-D brachytherapy treatment planning in the interstitial radiotherapy of breast cancer.	1.0861492556571264
In 103 patients with T1-2, N0-1 breast cancer the tumor bed was clipped during breast conserving surgery.	0.918062194066111
Fifty-two of them received boost brachytherapy after 46 to 50 Gy teletherapy and 51 patients were treated with brachytherapy alone via flexible implant tubes.	0.8936655301098417
Single, double and triple plane implant was used in 6, 89 and 8 cases, respectively.	1.175185892921432
The dose of boost brachytherapy and sole brachytherapy prescribed to dose reference points was 3 times, 4.75 Gy and 7 times 5.2 Gy, respectively.	1.0040447795054483
The positions of dose reference points varied according to the level (2-D, semi-3-D and 3-D) of treatment planning performed.	1.1283212923534907
The treatment planning was based on the 3-D reconstruction of the surgical clips, implant tubes and skin points.	1.120869463847712
In all cases the implantations were planned with a semi-3-D technique aided by simulator.	0.9728559386674925
In 10 cases a recently developed CT-guided 3-D planning system was used.	0.9915983764690831
The semi-3-D and 3-D treatment plans were compared to hypothetical 2-D plans using dose-volume histograms and dose non-uniformity ratios.	0.9880299652059824
The values of mean central dose, mean skin dose, minimal clip dose, proportion of underdosaged clips and mean target surface dose were evaluated.	0.9068464046449631
The accuracy of tumor bed localization and the conformity of planning target volume and treated volume were also analyzed in each technique.	0.9384972316434512
With the help of conformal semi-3-D and 3-D brachytherapy planing we could define reference dose points, active source positions and dwell times individually.	0.8404241326708467
This technique decreased the mean skin dose with 22.2% and reduced the possibility of geographical miss.	1.2071319823599662
We could achieve the best conformity between the planning target volume and the treated volume with the CT-image based 3-D treatment planning, at the cost of worse dose homogeneity.	1.1020543278287085
The mean treated volume was reduced by 25.1% with semi-3-D planning, however, it was increased by 16.2% with 3-D planning, compared to the 2-D planning.	1.323242766637163
The application of clips into the tumor bed and the conformal (semi-3-D and 3-d) planning help to avoid geographical miss.	0.9281733985974029
CT is suitable for 3-D brachytherapy planning.	1.0391715639379986
Better local control with less side effects might be achieved with these new techniques.	1.0132280830651916
Conformal 3-D brachytherapy calls for new treatment planning concepts, taking the irregular 3-D shape of the target volume into account.	1.143168630917101
The routine clinical application of image-based 3-D brachytherapy is a real aim in the very close future.	1.0776971145519811
Background: Staphylococci represent an important source of external infections of the eye.	1.119154195977356
In addition to acute staphylococcal conjunctivitis a spectrum of subacute or chronic disease may be found.	0.8810127261565392
According to Valenton und Okumoto, with this staphylococci-associated blepharo-kerato-conjunctivitis in culture-positive cases S. aureus is found in 31% and S. epidermidis in 69% of smears.	1.2224965552308047
Microbiallergic and toxic mechanisms are the underlying etiology.	0.8438823747300965
Multiple organ failure (MOF) may occur early or late after trauma.	0.8906058427516528
Besides direct physical injury of organs, compromise of the microcirculation by inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MOF.	0.8145868613668054
Inflammation also induces counterregulatory responses which may end up in immunoparalysis.	0.7178645626958312
As a result, infection and sepsis with additional inflammatory damage to the microcirculation ensue thereby contributing to the late development of MOF.	0.9115177279857819
In addition to this biphasic model of posttraumatic MOF, there is evidence that inflammation and immunoparalysis do not only occur in sequence to each other but in parallel early after surgical procedures.	1.1014448818859786
The aim of the present brief review is to summarize the posttraumatic mechanisms of inflammation and immunoparalysis and to discuss how to differentiate between both pathophysiologic states.	1.099612479762259
Early enteral nutrition is widely accepted for its support of organ structure and function ("gut injury hypothesis") and reduction of infectious complications and hypermetabolism in critically ill postoperative or postinjury patients.	1.1478074729367076
Nineteen severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score 40.3+/-11.6) were studied for the feasibility of early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube.	1.080479338776881
Despite maxillary fractures, rhinoliquorrhea and blunt abdominal trauma the enteral feeding was mostly started immediately after trauma.	0.7918098816852349
Intermittent diarrhea or constipation resolved after reduction of the feeding rate within 1 or 2 days.	0.9167035297063667
Total enteral nutrition could not be realized in all cases; a central venous line was always additionally necessary.	1.0645338502348345
However, the goal was not complete enteral nutrition but a continuous enteral supply to maintain the integrity of the gut.	1.2250743019159582
The study has shown that early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube is also feasible in severely injured patients.	0.7258653773256896
The expenditure to overcome the technical and organizational problems seems to be justified.	0.9429389867703193
Enterally fed patients may have a better outcome that those in whom only parenteral is employed.	1.038308494863996
Definition of the problem: The rapid pace of medical progress has drawn renewed attention to the various possible ways of treating dead or brain-dead pregnant women since the 1980's.	1.031995627172159
The discussion today revolves around medical, social, legal and economic aspects.	0.8478857076664125
The historical areas of conflict which surrounded deliveries carried out on dead mothers (usually by means of a Sectio in mortua, nowadays known as a perimortem Caesarean section) and their significance in today's debate are, for the most part, regarded as being of little relevance.	1.1499079126137965
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is one of the most frequent infectious lung diseases in immunocompromised patients, especially in AIDS cases.	1.0719295695535584
The present case report describes pulmonary miliary microcalcifications with and without foreign-body reaction in a patient with successfully treated PCP who was known to have AIDS.	1.073864572283999
This form of residues of completely healed PCP tends to be rare.	0.7473316009176317
Other infectious granulomas, foreign-body granulomas and sarcoidosis must be differentially diagnosed.	0.8221211420856983
After cautious decalcification, pneumocysts can be demonstrated with methamine silver (Grocott).	0.8148245972292925
It is important to be aware that PCP can also undergo spontaneous cure, so that miliary microcalcifications may then be the sole pointer to the presence of AIDS.	1.0598239468197466
Background: In congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency high pre- and postnatal androgen levels are present and might influence psychosexual and psychosocial development in affected girls.	1.02482865223824
Methods: In order to study the impact of high androgen levels as well as chronic medication and repeated surgery on female patients life we performed a comprehensive quality-of-life study.	1.0220927788649952
We report on the results obtained by structured interviews of adult patients (45) and their mothers (35) covering difficulties and problems in general, most aspects of their medical histology, self image, body image and current life with or without a male or female partner.	1.3365096460724937
Results: The patients were socially competent with a well developed social network.	1.1445441011885424
However, regarding sexual contacts they were shy and reluctant.	1.1916145468641381
These resulted in significantly less patients live with a partner or are married.	0.7647704628623879
Existing partnerships were more stable and satisfactory than in the control population.	1.0974678545560879
The incidence of homosexuality was not increased.	0.7005696565061621
The number of women having children was significantly reduced.	0.8071798238776229
A substantial number of women suffered from androgen-dependent problems like irrgular menses and hirsutism.	0.780576500117613
Mothers and patients denied any sex-specific eduction, but the girls had preferred boy-specific toys and competitive outdoor games.	1.0235138822269763
However, school performance was average and comparable to the controls.	1.3166434783350636
Most mothers expressed problems and questions regarding their daughters intersexuality at birth.	0.7057863816676438
Even though they felt they had received good medical treatment, mothers as well as patients felt they would have needed more psychological help.	0.9215435371889538
Conclusions: It seems that adult female patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia are able to adapt to their impairment and chronic disease.	1.1621446217923213
Problems regarding partnership, sexuality, and fertility remain and have to be addressed.	0.9973897232085169
Introduction: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has become an accepted treatment for end-stage liver disease.	1.0528020781814162
However, postoperative complications result in significant patient morbidity and mortality.	1.2771516577658462
Early detection and treatment of these complications is therefore of utmost importance.	1.022575336014639
Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the postoperative complications of the patients who underwent OLT at our institution.	1.2811598565956626
Duplex Doppler sonography and cholangiography were the primary imaging modalities in postoperative evaluation of the transplanted liver.	1.1157349764020577
Other important techniques were CT, MRI, and angiography, which may contribute to a reliable diagnosis of vascular or biliary complications.	1.1711306985256071
Results: Second to primary organ dysfunction, vascular complications are the most frequent cause of graft loss.	1.2042440570669588
Thrombosis of the hepatic artery is the most common and most serious vascular complication, with a reported incidence from 4 to 42 %.	1.185878875941803
Bile duct sludge, leaks and strictures are frequent complications after liver transplantation, which can contribute to graft dysfunction.	1.0664818873580102
Biliary tract complications usually occur within the first 3 months and require interventional radiological or surgical therapy.	0.9843667831500699
Since liver transplant recipients undergo immunosuppressive therapy, they are at increased risk of developing late post-transplant malignancies, which are best depicted by US, CT or MRI.	1.1406304746233533
However, radiological diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorder has to be confirmed by liver biopsy.	1.3418139476054642
Conclusion: Cholangiography and Duplex sonography are routinely used in the postoperative evaluation of patients with OLT.	1.2691011861063375
CT, MRI, and angiography are problem-solving tools in equivocal cases.	0.9465829924933158
Recurrence of colorectal carcinomas occurs in about 50 % of the cases with localized neoplasia.	1.127219470549236
It is understood that the tumor recurrence is due to residual micrometastases not found during surgery or extraregional (peripheral blood or bone marrow).	0.9776980962601998
We developed a procedure to detect non-visible, abdominal metastases using a radiolabeled anti-tumor cell antibody injected before the operation (radioimmunoguided surgery, RIGS).	0.9642517417402706
However, even with the best technique, it is not possible to remove all micrometastasis if a hematogenic dissemination happens.	1.3563688281652093
Based on the knowledge of disturbing humoral immune reaction is mounted against shed tumor associated antigens (TAA), we developed a new method to reduce and correct the B cell response and B cell recruitment due to chronic TAA immun complex presentation on follicular dendritic cells (immune corrective surgery, ICS).	1.016928185611255
This method is based on a selective lymphadenectomy.	1.118989539608593
The target lymph nodes were those loaded with TAA-immune complex.	0.7999207442072984
The detection method used was the injection of radiolabeled antibody able to recognize the immune complex.	0.8590289694023872
From 20 patients (stage I, II and III) treated with ICS, 17 survived more than 5 years ' showing a statistically significant increase of survival compared to patients treated with standard procedures.	1.161374915927094
In conclusion, these data show that surgery of colorectal cancer should be selectively extended to specific anatomical regions in order to remove hidden micrometastases, and more importantly, correct postoperative immune processes that could suppress the T cell response against residual tumor cells.	1.1712025307112985
Knowledge of normal and impaired pulmonary gas exchange is essential to the anaesthesiologist.	0.9570622484337574
Analysis of an arterial blood sample allows evaluation of whether or not pulmonary gas exchange is normal.	0.9202329927267373
For this purpose comparison with the oxygenation index or the alveolar-arterial PO2 difference is helpful.	1.0856550095655972
Pathological changes of these variables are mainly caused by ventilation-perfusion (V.A/Q.)	0.9281574786281422
In daily practice, venous admixture or intrapulmonary shunt can be calculated using arterial and mixed-venous blood.	1.0222236918780017
By analysing arterial and expired PCO2, dead-space ventilation can be determined, but extended analyses of V.A/Q.	0.8740216727980212
distribution are not possible in daily practice.	0.9278259690128887
However, knowledge of the principles of typical disturbances of pulmonary gas exchange in acute and chronic lung disease allows the use of therapeutic strategies based on the pathophysiological changes.	1.2039239716088717
Background: Infectious endocarditis can lead to embolic arterial retinal occlusions.	1.0974509135594603
The case of a 30 year old man with acatalasemia is presented.	1.0521560997422337
The congenital disorder  is charaterized by a lack or major reduction of catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water.	0.9155394018832794
The defect is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.	0.7591477960726675
Occasionally the defect manifests as progressive oral gangrene or Takahara's, disease.	0.6884199632859169
Poor longterm success has been reported for penile vein ligation the last few years.	0.9177788338720129
Therefore, we decided to re-investigate our group of 147 patients who were operated on between 1987 and 1996.	1.0983285929381918
All patients showed a negative response to intracavernous injection therapy at the time of diagnosis and revealed a maintenance flow > 15 ml/min, as well as a pathological venous flow with pharmacocavernosometry or pharmacocavernosography.	1.0914910197884864
These patients underwent ligation of all superficial dorsal veins and resection of the deep dorsal vein of the penis.	0.9151030938692581
An up-to-date record of the success of the operation was kept either by a renewed clinical visit or by a standardized telephone interview or questionnaire.	1.0768520540407893
A total of 126 patients were available here for long-term follow-up.	0.9217824209622151
We divided the findings into three groups: complete spontaneous erection, postoperative response to cavernous auto-injection therapy and no changes in erectile competency postoperatively.	0.900399334753626
The short-term success rate for these groups after 1-3 months was an outcome of 31 (24.6 %), 25 (19.8 %) and 70 (55.6 %) patients; 86 % of the cases whose results deteriorated after the initial operation success rate had this happen within the first postoperative year (p K 0.001).	1.2921324791248072
Favorable prognostic factors were preoperative erectile dysfunction of K 7 years, a normal CC-EMG and a maintenance flow of K 45 ml/min.	0.9580405810679425
If all three parameters were present, the long-term success rate (spontaneous erection plus response to intracavernous injection) of 30 % of all patients was found to rise to 67 % in this selected group of patients (p K 0.001).	1.2504711568820368
This study reveals that long-term success for unselected patients undergoing penile venous surgery is disappointing; however, careful selection of patients by certain prognostic factors can improve long-term results.	1.1441427367729458
Pyoderma gangraenosum can cause great therapeutic problems.	0.6069428651790733
High dosed corticosteroids are the treatment of choice.	0.792471673871125
However, recalcitrant pyoderma gangraenosum or side effects from corticosteroid treatment may require therapeutic alternatives.	1.0545150216583077
Pyoderma gangraenosum responds excellently to treatment with cyclosporine A.	0.6495523538381718
Because of side effects and drug interactions, the patients must be selected and carefully and closely monitored.	1.17937274197281
Six patients with pyoderma gangraenosum, unresponsive to various topical and systemic therapies, were treated with oral cyclosporine A at mean daily doses of approximately 3 mg/kg.	0.9761022558267193
Marked improvement of the skin lesions and complete healing occurred in all patients over a period of 3-6 months.	1.3758455398804599
Only one patient suffered a relapse after discontinuation of the treatment.	0.9570914542060701
No severe irreversible side effects occurred.	0.631511831279898
The results show that low-dose cyclosporine A treatment can be considered a first-line treatment of pyoderma gangraenosum.	1.186012740551148
Medical treatment of injured patients by international missions of non-governmental organisations in crisis areas and out-of-area operations by troops, and also national disasters require special trauma management.	0.9806490874279787
Deviations from peacetime surgical guidelines are obligatory because of long-distance medical evacuation, the possibility of gaps in supply and the typical pattern of war injuries.	0.9607258564622881
Massive contamination combined with the high risk of infection is one typical attribute of wounds inflicted during a war or a disaster.	1.1050813813828757
In contrast to peacetime surgical guidelines, aggressive wound débridement is often needed.	0.9602011517926013
Timely and prophylactically prescription of a broad-spectrum antibiotic with a long half-life has great importance in the treatment of these wounds.	0.9554454207373817
Suitable antibiotics for these indications are: piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriazon.	0.7129016339891338
Nevertheless the use of antimicrobial agents will only be effective with early surgical débridement.	0.904763657273343
Craniofacial development may be potentially implicated after vault corrections in cases of craniosynostosis.	0.7653736353560401
The aim of this prospective study was the investigation of the surgical effect on calvaria growth, correlating the percentiles of a group of patients before and after craniosynostosis correction in relation to the normal percentiles of growth.	1.0701962145213972
The patient population consisted of 71 children; the postoperative follow-up time in 57 patients was more than 12 months.	1.1667091792677273
Of the children followed up, 36 were male and 21 female.	1.1938776567104483
Thirty-six cases involved untreated non-syndromic craniosynostosis; the remaining 21 were syndrome cases.	1.0594142402017035
The patient ages ranged from 16 to 27 months.	0.6393041054681883
In 11 cases correction of an occipital craniosynostosis was carried out.	0.8558907973160051
The fronto-occipital circumference was registered in accordance with Prader's percentile table.	0.8213017084735551
The operative method included a fronto-parietal craniotomy, the temporary removal and shaping of the fronto-orbital band and a vault cranioplasty.	1.025036529243532
During follow-up 13 patients treated with fronto-orbital advancement in cases of isolated craniosynostosis remained in the registered percentile curve.	0.9770566990341009
In 13 patients a change to a lower percentile curve was confirmed; 1 patient changed to a higher curve.	1.1783994501521664
In cases of syndromic craniosynostosis 10 patients remained in the post-operatively registered percentile curve; 8 patients changed to a lower and 1 patient to a higher percentile curve.	1.066332622032991
No growth restriction of the reshaped calvaria after surgical correction of craniosynostosis was observed.	0.8300756148269126
No significant difference was found in the potential calvaria growth between syndromic and isolated craniosynostosis.	1.1214598500034447
Today a large number of operative procedures on retroperitoneal organs can be performed using minimally invasive techniques.	0.9298928243431133
The retroperitoneal space can be reached laparoscopically through the peritoneal cavity or by the direct retroperitoneoscopic approach.	0.9763006364027979
The correct anatomical placement of the first trocar is of particular importance in procedures with the patient in lateral decubitus position in order to avoid injuries.	1.1697718694251173
The overview is worse than in conventional surgery because of the magnifying effect of the laparoscope, which is, furthermore, positioned very close to the operative field.	1.2526297145284226
It is therefore of great importance for the surgeon to use anatomical structures for orientation.	1.0809459941953492
The decisive anatomical aspects and landmarks in different minimally invasive operations on retroperitoneal organs are outlined.	0.8087816358300278
Lipid peroxidation is considered a prominent feature of age-related retinal degeneration.	0.9218639758519822
It is known that lipid peroxides can oxidize benzidine.	0.7009249612141707
This property was used to localize lipid peroxides ultrastructurally in the retina.	0.8070590521040788
In a 73 year-old male patient with generalized atherosclerosis, known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, renal artery stenosis, and coronary artery disease, an aneurysm of the proximal left subclavian artery was successfully excluded by implantation of a JOSTENTTM-Peripheral stent graft.	1.1630530529343654
Angiographic follow up after 6 and 12 months showed an excellent outcome with complete exclusion of the aneurysm.	1.0548662785298755
Intravascular ultrasound showed no neo-intimal hyperplasia within the stent.	0.66689856026115
A computed tomography revealed complete thrombosis of the aneurysm.	0.793047456243265
Based upon our increasing knowledge of mechanisms underlying tissue destruction in RA patients, new therapeutic principles have been developed, aimed at blocking proinflammatory cytokines or using antiinflammatory cytokines.	0.9527587649647026
Both principles, however, have proven to be very effective.	1.220305292433343
In addition, the availability of the methodology to transduce cells with genes has initiated first experiments in animal models to test whether gene therapy for arthritis is suitable, followed by a first, very carefully formulated protocol for human RA.	1.0770696852307728
Gene therapy for RA has to still be considered as an experimental form of therapy in a very early stage, not allowing even now any serious treatment offer to RA patients.	1.166685688628736
Several problems, such as the question of a suitable vector system have not yet been solved.	1.130609620921319
With more experiments this therapeutic principle might become available and might prove effective even in a disease with a systemic character like RA in the coming years.	0.9660253401939347
In the case of typical whiplash after low- energy rear-end collision we recommend a clear and structured therapeutic regimen to overcome and prevent neuromuscular deficits.	1.0562251969410754
Patients with bony and discoligamentous lesions have to be excluded, as well as patients with distinct neurologic deficits.	0.9169175582766436

The news of success in ether anesthesia on 16 October 1846 in Boston spread like wildfire through Europe.	0.7199839807590591
In the German-speaking countries, the national newspapers as conveyers of the development played a prominent role; this was especially the case for the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung whose correspondent, Aloys Martin [1], was a medical professional.	1.1749862814175056
The function of local newspapers has not yet been investigated.	0.8985096634615207
This was to be remedied by examining both of Bamberg's local papers.	0.8368285704069611
All issues from 01.01. to 31.04.1847 were surveyed with respect to relevant announcements.	0.994573978940894
These were then catalogued according to date, extent and contents.	0.9169061331708368
Starting on 22.01.1847, the events outside of and in Bamberg were reported on in 26 notices and articles of just a few lines to half a page and in advertisements; Aloys Martin also appears on the scene.	1.001036449321031
Thus, the local press in Bamberg also informed its readers early and regularly on the discovery of ether and the succeeding events.	1.0000266780895322
True arterial aneurysms of the infrapopliteal vessels are a rare finding.	0.7660819445059626
During surgical treatment of convergent aneurysms of the popliteal artery and the tibiofibular trunk we discovered a complete spontaneous rupture of the thrombotic aneurysm of the right tibiofibular trunk.	1.0512940397546129
We describe the special features of diagnosis, histology, and the surgical treatment of aneurysms of the crural arteries.	1.203800331053862
We recommend that even asymptomatic aneurysms be electively operated on to prevent further complications.	0.9428632079259116
Dementia is going to be one of the major challenges of the next century for our societies due to the enormous burden on the health care systems.	1.008820883837415
Dementia is the major cause of death and the most important risk factor for disability and entry into a nursing home in elderly people.	1.087610967643002
Moreover, because of the progress in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, in particular with the cholinesterase inhibitors, demented people will be more often and detected earlier by general practitioners and families.	1.1564353347934133
Nowadays operative sperm retrieval in connection with assisted reproduction is a well-established procedure in urological-gynecological cooperative groups.	0.8991586572754954
Microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA) and testicular sperm extraction (TESE) are the fundamental procedures in cases of non-reconstructable obstructive azoospermia or testicular azoospermia.	1.0238065419564781
As they are often favored percutaneous techniques such as percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA) or percutaneous testicular sperm extraction (PTESE), need to be in Anglo-American countries and the countries of northern Europe, discussed regarding their efficacy (number of retrieved spermatozoa) and possible testicular injury due to blind or ultrasound-guided puncture.	1.0352813705443498
In Middle Franconia, one of the larger Bavarian administrative division (population 1994: 1,657,101), the number of patients suffering from cancer pain, chronic headache and chronic back pain is not known.	1.1499986414112724
Furthermore, there are no data on interdisciplinary organization of outpatient pain management.	1.2197069596162569
A 34-year-old HIV-infected African woman developed fever, weight loss and widespread papules on her trunk, arms and face.	1.009351586731838
Skin biopsy and culture revealed histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum varietas capsulatum (American histoplasmosis).	0.7442533836548042
Even though antimycotic treatment and intensive care were started immediately the patient died because of the systemic mycosis within a few days.	1.0833555826090473
Histoplasmosis is a rare disease in Europe but endemic in some areas of the USA (e.g.	0.9094595193723258
Ohio, Mississippi) and of Africa.	1.166935023630557
Additionally histoplasma capsulatum varietas duboisii is endemic in Central and South Africa.	0.7167243507564067
As a consequence of scientific advances, an increasing number of patients with advanced age, reduced myocardial performance, previous cardiac surgery, comorbidities, and emergency indications are referred for cardiac surgery.	1.1847982538790076
This requires risk stratification to predict "low", "moderate", and "high" operative risk.	1.231403291188198
Risk factors can be divided into pre-, intra-, and postoperative patient-, structure-, and procedure-related.	1.4710874131770049
On the basis of this risk prediction, the perioperative course can be optimized by an individually tailored multiprofessional and interdisciplinary management.	1.1281946018349442
Unnoticed, minor damage to the unidirectional respiratory valves of the Draeger respiratory circuit may lead to intermittent and unpredictable malfunction, resulting in rebreathing and hypercapnia.	0.8991893544015663
The damage may be so minor that normal visual and functional test routines may be insufficient to detect it.	0.8381808713577119
We report one case of a potential life-threatening malfunction of the inspiratory valve and also propose economical solutions utilizing altered construction, modified machine-check procedures, or a simple instrument that adds only one step to the machine-check procedure.	1.0966327391762536
The general problem of minor but functionally important damage to parts of ventilatory equipment - so-called borderline damage - may not be limited to this particular model or manufacturer.	1.0564208936265007
Most users of ventilatory equipment believe that equipment that goes through normal check procedures is either fully functional or non-functional.	0.8040282667934742
In reality, this is not the case.	1.456285901831624
Intermittent malfunctions due to slightly damaged equipment may be missed with normal machine-check procedures.	0.835793011600465
This problem results in a significant but incalculable increased in risk to patients.	0.9079310182313456
Because of unclear reproduceability of intermittent malfunctions caused by borderline damage, there also is an increased forensic risk for the anaesthesiologist.	1.1023687948790022
The risk of mechanical malfunction might be displaced by software problems in new-generation ventilators in the market.	0.8233402004350421
Purpose: To investigate whether the margins of microscopic tumors can be delineated better with monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles (MION), a superparamagnetic contrast medium, than with Gd-DTPA by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).	0.9175948640958449
Nonunion of the ankle malleoli is extremely rare these days.	1.033274301525263
This is probably due to the fact that primary osteosynthesis is performed in ankle fractures instead of the conservative treatment given up to 20 years ago.	1.051652884314327
Today nonunions of the malleoli are seen, if at all, is infected cases after surgical procedures.	1.156178621651767
Noninfected, stable and painless nonunions usually do not need any surgical correction.	0.8200127530019697
In painful cases, small fragments, especially of the medial malleolus, should be resected; larger fragments should be stabilized with two 3.5-mm cancellous screws.	1.2102966766782801
Alternatively, the tension banding technique, especially after Weber A fracture, produces high compression in the area of nonunion.	1.098870140848812
In cases of additional bony defects, a local upside down cortical-cancellous bone graft should be performed in addition.	1.1025144020122974
In summary, the therapeutic approach requires exact remodeling, bone-grafting and stabilization.	1.1902361950674196
Infected nonunions with loss of bone mass should be treated according to the guidelines for osteitis therapy.	1.0631824097774931
This study investigated the influence of the patients' educational level on indication for and duration of psychotherapy and the choice of treatment methods (psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy or psychoanalysis).	1.1398718069296039
We considered treatments that were conducted within the framework of the statutory health insurance in Germany.	0.7588883616465538
Data were collected from the therapists' case history (n=274), submitted to the first author as an expert of the statutory health insurance companies.	1.0231888041646806
We found a significant relationship between level of education and indication for psychotherapy.	0.9666403183524549
In our sample 43.5% had graduated from senior high school compared with 25.1% in the average German population.	1.05709720220383
This relationship is getting more clear if we discriminate between psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.	0.7736043765368157
51.7% of the patients undergoing psychoanalysis had graduated from senior high school and only 13.2% from junior high school compared with 48.7% in the average German population.	1.1142828701251517
Also the duration of psychotherapy depends only on the level of education, not on gender, age or type of statutory health insurance.	1.2125418949097284
These results are discussed carefully and questions for further investigations are deduced.	1.0083186063857181
After the initial enthusiasm subsided lasercoagulation of the prostate has been criticized because the extent of tissue destruction cannot be controlled and many patients may be expected to have significant postoperative obstructive as well as irritative voiding symptoms which may last for weeks.	1.1213947279684844
Thanks to new laservaporization techniques these disadvantages have been largely eliminated.	0.7350658330996466
With the Holmium laser a real resection of prostatic tissue is possible allowing the surgeon to see the prostatectomy defect immediately and to assess tissue destruction during the operation ("what you see is what you get").	1.0339990384131454
The postoperative voiding disturbances are diminished and comparable to those after TUR-P.	0.8406421716137569
The classification of acetabular fractures and especially the diagnosis of additional lesions can be misleading, when the personal experience is limited and the decisions are based only on conventional radiographs.	1.0885213358677752
The introduction of Spiral-CT with multiplanar reformations and 3-D views has improved the quality of visualization.	0.9891993182550671
Due to their higher costs, the need of these additional diagnostic tools is frequently questioned.	1.0821548752325714
This paper discusses the relevance of plain radiographs, 2-D-CTs, 3-D-CTs and Femursubtraction-CTs (FsCT) for the classification of acetabular fractures, based on a controlled study.	1.102205438600198
Methods: Thirty physicians with different levels of experience in acetabular surgery were divided in three groups of 10 each: group I comprised residents without operative experience in acetabular surgery, group II was physicians with 3-10 years of operative experience, and group III was experts in acetabular surgery.	1.2552495786265037
A total of 10 complete radiographic cases of high quality providing all levels of preoperative diagnostics (plain radiographs, 2-D-CT, CT with multiplanar reformation, 3-D-CT, Fs-CT) of different acetabular fracture types were prepared.	1.1532251074072877
The task for each candidate was to classify the fracture according to Letournel and to identify all additional injuries within the hip joint (e. g. marginal impaction, head fractures, etc.).	0.9200807895023663
The different diagnostic "levels" could be ordered stepwise according to personal need and no time limit was given.	0.95379707094298
The case was finished when the candidate presented his final diagnosis.	0.7387358461913566
The use of the different radiographs, the preliminary diagnosis, the changes in diagnosis, and the final decisions were recorded.	1.4448351223669866
These findings were correlated with the different levels of experience and against a "consensus classification" which was generated by thorough discussion, and the use of intraoperative information and postoperative radiographs not accessible to the candidates.	1.2601526199408264
Results: The "correct" fracture classification based on plain radiographs was: group I, 11 %; group II, 32 %; group III, 61 %.	1.176849552369718
Based on 2-D-CT a "correct" diagnosis was reached by 30 % in group I, by 55 % in group II, and by 76 % in group III.	1.3410074358690844
With consideration of the "transient forms" in acetabular fractures based on Letournel and the 3-D-CT used mainly by group I, the rate of "correct" classifications rose to 65 % in group I, 64 % in group II and 83 % in group III.	1.1420202041322645
The modifiers were diagnosed "correctly" in group I by 37 %, in group II by 56 %, and in group III by 73 %.	1.377018696975255
The use of the 3-D-CT and especially the Fs-CT by group I resulted in an improvement in the rate of correct classifications to 61 %, whereas in group II the Fs-Ct was used only exceptionally.	1.2292883862438293
The 2-D-CT was the basis for the diagnosis of the additional lesions in acetabular fractures within all groups resulting in 73 % complete diagnoses in group III.	1.245903321617709
This study showed the importance of CT for the exact analysis and classification of acetabular fractures.	0.8856871448609772
In particular, the secondary reformations in CT and the 3-D-views dramatically improved the rate of "correct" classifications in the group of surgeons with limited personal experience in acetabular surgery.	1.0361607007222031
This allows the less experienced an acceptable level of "correct" diagnoses, so that the treatment options can be weighed correctly.	1.0120025996648763
Among the "experts" a rate of divergent classifcations of approximately 20 % was observed, especially in "transient" forms of acetabular fractures.	1.2005761242895938
Background: Iridodonesis is the clinical sign of lens subluxation.	1.1603973387813156
Acute glaucoma caused by a ciliolenticular block may develop.	0.7156904324710525
YAG iridotomy or peripheral iridectomy are rarely effective in controlling intraocular pressure.	0.7269576839790284
The results of phacoemulsification and posterior lens implantation for subluxated lens and glaucoma are reported.	0.7999075174903484
Cerebral perfusion reserve may be determined by assessing changes in cerebral blood flow using vasodilators.	0.8571588980552692
Transcranial Doppler (TCD) may be used to measure cerebral blood flow speed in response to such stimuli.	1.1389917337413469
The aim of this study was to analyze cerebral vasoreactivity in patients with high-grade carotid stenosis and to determine the short- and long-term effects of desobliteration.	1.0878357998865873
A total of 40 patients had bilateral preoperative studies done and 24 were re-evaluated 1 year later.	0.9388790728151358
The preoperative vasomotor capacity using TCD with CO2 was 57% +/- 45.	0.740387835713908
Hemodynamic reserve did not decrease significantly in the early postoperative period on the operated hemisphere, and 1 year later hemodynamic reserve had increased to to 102% +/- 80%.	1.129355603087379
One year later patients with unilateral stenosis (n=11) presented with a restitution of reactivity to 65% +/- 46% after initial postoperative ipsilateral decrease from 51% +/- 35% to 48% +/- 38%.	0.9083286791632713
Patients with bilateral stenoses (n=9) demonstrated an initial decrease from 70% +/- 60% to 48% +/- 21% and a significant rise to 115% +/- 77% 1 year later (P=0.02).	1.0442162187091437
Both the significant postoperative increase in the cerebral vasomotor capacity in patients with bilateral carotid stenoses registered in both hemispheres and long-term improvement in patients with unilateral stenosis underline the effectivity of carotid desobliteration in antiembolic prophylaxis and in cerebral blood flow increase, irrespective of the symptomatology.	0.9785343637674249
Chronic constipation can be divided in two large groups: slow-transit constipation, caused by pathological intestinal transit, and obstructive defecation disorder, caused by pelvic and rectal wall abnormalities.	0.9899951018232078
Videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are methods used to study dynamic evacuation of the rectum.	0.8037745346337439
Videodefecography also enables visual estimation of rectal evacuation.	0.7372865284228681
Defecoflowmetry allows analysis of anal and rectal pressures.	0.6866496444359398
Within this prospective study we utilized and compared these methods in 19 patients with slow transit and 30 patients with obstructive disease.	1.1379246513360408
In patients with slow transit, both investigations demonstrated a significantly higher defecation rate than in obstructive defecation disorder (slow transit: defecoflowmetry 65 %, videodefecography 80 %; obstructive defecation disorder: 50 % and 58 %).	1.1313502208762403
The evacuation time was pathologically prolonged in both types of constipation, with a range of 43-55 s. Rectoceles are demonstrated in 94 % of cases with slow transit and in 72 % with obstructive defecation disorder.	1.2641308255494363
Also, we often found obstructive components in slow-transit constipation patients.	1.103827044338015
Normal defecography or defecoflowmetry can rule out obstructive defecation disorder.	0.5711916903967179
We conclude that videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are important items in the complex diagnostic regimen needed in evaluation of chronic constipation.	1.0821412924536074
Absence of the septum pellucidum is a rare developmental disorder of the human brain.	1.1450276549318272
Previous reports focused on the association with other cerebral anomalies.	0.8741523122101499
We present MRI scans showing an isolated absence of the septum pellucidum.	0.803418470294683
The patient was suffering from a schizophrenic psychosis.	1.0162701570708599
Mental retardation or epileptic seizures, which are often found in more complex developmental brain disorders, were not observed.	1.2077554075022698
The septal area is part of the limbic system and aplasia of the septum pellucidum could indicate developmental anomalies of the limbic system.	0.7580752093265993

History and clinical findings: A 61 year old man presented with newly developed tachyarrhythmia.	1.1524902884628887
Echocardiographically a tumour of unclear origin in the left atrium was diagnosed.	0.9769600891262916
Investigations: The heart rate in the ECG was arrhythmic at 146/min; intermittently sinus rhythm was established.	0.9571992978875068
Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a 90x50 mm tumour with sharp borders displacing both atria.	0.7141538138320659
The chest x-ray showed a mediastinal rounded mass in the dorsal part overlapping the right mediastinal border.	0.9084378068310448
Computer tomography was unable to discriminate the atrial wall from the tumour masses; hence the difference between an (intra-)cardiac tumour (i.e.	1.0035538536664712
myxoma) and a tumour of extracardiac (mediastinal) origin could not be established.	1.1448069852979785
Additional magnetic resonance tomography led to the most probable diagnosis of a bronchogenic cyst, which spread ventrally up to the ascending aorta and dorsally to the paravertebral region, thus displacing and shrinking the left pulmonary artery and the left atrium.	1.290313993440491
Therapy: For certain exclusion of malignancy and because of displacement of other thoracic structures the patient was operated on this mediastinal mass by anterolateral thoracotomy.	0.9938447921304389
Histologically a dysontogenetic, benign cyst with an inner layer of mesothel and nerval as well as vascular structures in the capsule was diagnosed.	0.9357710203206138
Since the operation the patient has persistent sinus rhythm without symptoms of relevant rhythm disorders.	1.00450080919907

Midcarpal fusion is a reliable procedure for treating the difficult condition of advanced carpal collapse is proper realignement of the carpus is performed.	0.9261493265553735
The DASH-score reflects the subjective impressions of the patients in daily life and justifies the choice of a salvage procedure preserving wrist mobility.	1.147039288677169
Total wrist fusion represents the last line of defense.	0.6662784928204604
Stress fractures are one of the most common overuse injuries seen in athletes, accounting for up to 20 % of all injuries presented to sports medicine clinics.	1.210252014230351
Runners are particularly prone to these injuries, however, it is difficult to predict injury as there is usually a critical interplay between the athlete's biomechanical predisposition, training methods, and other factors such as diet, and muscle strength and flexibility.	1.1401462448725286
This article will discuss the key clinical findings for the majority of stress fractures encountered in a sports medicine practice.	1.022294201699695
A classification scheme will also be described that will allow the clinician to make appropriate treatment decisions based on the degree of risk for each injury.	0.9960897750312534
Today, enzyme therapy with proteolytic enzymes still only plays a minor role in clinical practice, partially due to the belief that intestinal resorption of macromolecules is impossible.	0.9062998634720837
However, there is scientific evidence of intestinal resorption and a subsequent increase in proteolytic serum activity, and placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials have demonstrated positive effects of enzyme therapy.	1.2587342938408213
The documented effects include the reduction of oedema and resorption of haematoma, resulting in pain reduction and better mobility.	0.9444861842860451
There are indications to use such therapies in the areas of general surgery, traumatology, plastic surgery, and dental surgery.	1.06242756524274
A further effect is higher tissue concentration of antibiotics in combination with proteolytic enzymes.	0.8519755287827696
In gynaecological treatments, enzymes are administered in breast surgery and to reduce the side effects of obstetrical injuries.	0.9108807057692611
Breast engorgement is a further indication for enzyme therapy.	0.7953503034010881
Further studies concerning enzyme therapy are justified because of the interesting possibilities offered by these substances and a favourable relationship between costs and benefits.	0.9532369476762209
High-frequency ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide represent - among others - two treatment options in hypoxemic respiratory failure of neonates.	1.1222741658837851
We report the case of a term infant with meconium aspiration syndrome, who only responded favorably to inhaled nitric oxide following the initiation of high-frequency ventilation.	0.9681699508185663
At an oxygenation index of 17 we started treatment with nitric oxide in order to reverse right-to-left shunting and improve oxygenation.	0.9290458933997995
How- ever the respiratory situation did not improve, the oxygenation index increased to 25.	0.9316526506145806
After discontinuation of nitric oxide the mode of ventilation was switched to HFV with mean airway pressures of 15 mbar.	0.7647581498238746
Again oxyena-tion was unaffected with an oxygenation index of meanwhile 31.	0.7556869967763215
At that stage of a second trial of inhaled nitric oxide was started at a concentration of 10 ppm while continuing high-frequency ventilation.	0.974957236642232
Immediately oxygenation improved significantly, the oxygenation index decreased to 9 within several minutes after restarting nitric oxide.	0.9184363300471455
This effect on oxygenation was sustained for the duration of several days during high-frequency ventilation until gradual weaning from iNO could be performed.	1.0378470895615088
Learning microsurgery of the middle ear requires preparations of temporal bones.	0.7301349908978612
Ethical and moral restrictions in obtaining specimens make training and research with temporal bone preparations increasingly more difficult.	0.7970788565732189
Due to the complex structure of the temporal bone with its communicating cavities, the manufacture of facsimiles up to now has been impossible.	1.0803229338091418
Rapid prototyping techniques must be able to produce identical objects from an original one.	0.7774052707190701
By using CT scans of temporal bones from anatomic preparations and patients we have been able to reconstruct 3D pictures on a CAD workstation.	0.9463775013107327
We are now able to incorporate data in a stereolithographic system to create an anatomic facsimile of the temporal bone.	0.9459586454750839
It is possible to produce a considerable number of these facsimiles from the same real object.	1.1717011654693985
With this method we can produce models of human structure for medical teaching, training and research.	1.028798343695555
Our artificial preparations of temporal bones correspond to both the material characteristics and anatomic details of human structures, allowing various surgical exercises to be carried out.	0.9118249623440611
During the past few years the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the most frequent of the rheumatic inflammatory systemic diseases has improved a great deal.	1.3281680420016289
The treatment strategy is based on the one hand on the so-called prognostic factors and on the other hand on the extent of the inflammatory activities, especially during the first phase.	1.281450579255683
Numerous controlled studies and meta-analyses have enabled optimal application of the basic disease-modifying drugs, with regard to efficacy and side effects.	1.039684290848103
During the first stage of these disease, the immunobiological substances against pro-inflammatory cells are employed.	1.057695418751801
Improved knowledge of physiotherapeutic treatment, correct diet and careful observation of the patient's progress with the aid of questionnaires enable optimal care with regard to life quality.	1.0840653266875853
Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi) occurring during mechanical ventilation depends on expiratory time constants, expiratory volume and expiration time as well as on external flow resistance (tubes, valves, etc.).	0.859394315416282
It is not routinely determined in mechanically ventilated patients, but it is necessary to optimize respirator settings.	1.2212951023390857
The aim of the present study was the validation of an automated PEEPi determination method implemented in the respirator EVITA (Drägerwerke, Lübeck) in mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung failure.	1.0983641636354093
The method was validated in ten sedated, myorelaxed patients with respiratory insufficiency of different etiologies (five with restrictive, and five with obstructive pulmonary disease).	1.1335280283584388
PEEPi was determined using the volume constant ventilatory mode at ZEEP or at an external PEEP of 5 as well as 10 cm H2O.	0.9714436347074148
PEEPi was first determined with the automated method implemented in the EVITA (five measurements at each end-expiratory pressure level; PEEPEvita).	0.9656891477268889
Steady-state was attained between each measurement.	0.6093007790794464
These values were compared to the results obtained with end-expiratory occlusion (external, computer-controlled valve in the inspiratory limb of the circuit) at the respective pressure levels (PEEPEEO).	1.1865258659195927
The average of five measurements at each PEEP level with each method was defined as PEEPi for the particular ventilatory situation.	0.948960770608474
Gas flow was measured at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube with a heated pneumotachometer (Fleisch no.	0.8596999301641627
2, Fleisch, Lausanne, Switzerland) and a differential pressure transducer.	1.0911332897424855
Tracheal pressure was determined in the same position with a further differential pressure transducer (Dr. Fenyves & Gut, Basel, Switzerland).	0.9547758828257317
After A/D conversion, data were sampled with a frequency of 20 Hz and processed on an IBM compatible PC.	0.9480591382272737
Software for data collection and processing as well as for control of the occlusion valve was self-programmed.	1.027916579935285
For the statistical analysis we used the Mann-Whitney U-test or Wilcoxon signed-ranks test; a P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.	0.9480400368330073
At the given respiratory setting and without PEEP patients with obstructive lung disease had a higher PEEPi (median: 6.4 cm H2O; range: 5.0 - 9.6 cm H2O) than those with restrictive pulmonary disease (median: 2.3 cm H2O; range: 0.8 - 3.0 cm H2O) (P<0.05).	1.3266083773962776
Increasing external PEEP to 5 or 10 cm H2O significantly decreased the pressure difference between PEEPi and external PEEP (P<0.05), but was unable to eliminate it completely.	1.0546861285804774
There was no statistically significant difference between PEEPEEO and PEEPEvita (P=0.43; Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests).	1.0579143108033633
Regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between PEEPEEO and PEEPEvita values (r=0.985, P<0.001; y=1.03x-0.18).	0.9176784243774192
PEEPi occurs during ventilation in patients with obstructive and restrictive lung disease.	0.8994342914849882
The difference between external end-expiratory pressure and PEEPi decreases with increasing external PEEP.	0.9532265327363607
However, PEEPi may increase with increasing external PEEP in some instances.	1.2984373278051717
The reason for this may be that the PEEPi determined at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube represents only a mean value of different PEEPi values of various lung regions.	1.0214335506076384
Increasing external PEEP only partially alters this mean value due to an effect on PEEPi values lower than external PEEP.	0.9291691661350986
The PEEPi values measured by the EVITA respirator compared with classical end-expiratory occlusion with an external valve were nearly identical.	1.0264547173137788
Unfortunately, PEEPi measurement of the EVITA can only	1.0193561547808652
We report on the case of a 70-year-old caucasian woman with a large linear sebaceous naevus with multifocal intralesional basaliomas and a lipodermoid of the left eye.	1.1710176438249063
This rare finding has been preserved because of the special history of the patient.	0.9858080052776155
The naevus spread on the left side from parietal to retroauricular, nuchal and sternal.	0.8573384589126279
Because of the patient's cardio-pulmonary insufficiency we excised the basaliomas under local anaesthesia.	0.9387551094710159
We also made a partial stripped excision of the left-sided parietal parts of the naevus.	1.0681743254898284
We describe an HLA-B27 positive patient in whom posttraumatic pyogenic sacroilitis led to complete unilateral sacroiliac joint ankylosis in the absence of any signs indicative of HLA-B27 associated spondyloarthropathy.	0.9040304642754743
Ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, has recently been shown, in a dose of 8 mg, to be superior to 1.25 mg droperidol in preventing postoperative vomiting.	1.2374212722064057
There are indications that a dose of 4 mg of ondansetron may be just as effective in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting as a dose of 8 mg [16].	1.0613774883523615
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and the adverse effects of 4 mg ondansetron in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting compared to droperidol in patients undergoing surgery with inhalation anaesthesia supplemented with alfentanil.	1.0079290951933395
Following institutional approval, 40 ASA physical status I and II women scheduled for minor gynaecological surgery gave informed consent to participate in this randomized, double-blind comparative study.	0.8882043001346082
Five minutes before induction of general anaesthesia, 20 patients received a single intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg of ondansetron and the remaining 20 received 1.25 mg droperidol IV.	1.0031870550492632
Anaesthesia was induced with 2.1 - 4 mg/kg of thiopental and 0.1 mg of alfentanil IV and maintained with 65% nitrous oxide and 1.5% - 3% enflurane in oxygen.	1.3672879153477693
On pain stimuli another 0.2 - 0.4 mg of alfentanil was given.	1.463912753700501
Total effective antiemetic response was defined as the absence of nausea and vomiting for 24 h postoperatively.	0.9147961377239167
The incidence of nausea, vomiting and the number of patients showing total antiemetic response as well as the incidence of adverse effects were compared with the chi2 test and P<0.05 was considered significant.	1.0742044161122362
Patients were similar with respect to age, height, body weight and total anaesthetic agents received.	0.8062971768537863
Duration of anaesthesia and the time until awakening was not significantly different among groups.	1.2369483913931811
Postoperatively 7 out of 20 patients given 4 mg of ondansetron and 3 out of 20 patients with droperidol vomited (n.s.).	0.9963394230229639
The incidence of nausea was 11 out of 20 in the ondansetron group, and 4 out of 20 in the droperidol group (P<0.05).	0.9199161287285889
Sixteen patients in the droperidol group and 8 patients in the ondansetron group showed a total effective antiemetic response (P<0.05).	0.8695279447553852
Postoperative sedation and well-being scores did not differ significantly among groups.	1.0572165363274642
Our results show that for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting 4 mg of ondansetron was inferior to 1.25 mg of droperidol.	0.9137291154699411
The drugs were given intravenously prior to general anaesthesia for minor gynaecological surgery with nitrous oxide and enflurane in oxygen supplemented with small boluses of alfentanil.	0.8777634116588504

Since 1993, 30 patients with acute distal intraarticular radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance.	0.7623869412427795
According to the AO classification there were 3 B- and 27 C-fractures, most of them Frykman VIII fractures.	1.0856752658731679
Of 30 fractures 23 showed additional lesions which could only be diagnosed under arthroscopic view.	0.8287058852013041
In particular, 12 partial or complete tears of the intracarpal ligaments were found.	1.04666758449662
Of 25 fractures 23 which were treated at least 12 months previously could be followed up radiologically and clinically.	1.052647449082131
X-rays included postero anterior and lateral views to evaluate the radial angles and the radial length and stress tests to check for instability, especially of the scapholunate ligaments.	1.0536873691362456
Clinical examination included range of motion and objective grip strength measured with a Jamar (Cedaron) tester.	0.8763712620402864
Each test was performed on both wrists for comparison.	0.9296486269103058
Subjective data included pain and function for daily activities.	0.7573486944772044
Data were evaluated by the Jakim and the Cooney scoring system and the demerit point system by Gartland and Werley as modified by Sarmiento et al.	0.6026719796579222
About 70% of our patients showed an excellent or good result; about 15% had a poor result.	1.268570096438235
However, we must mention that we were not able to reduce one C3-fracture under arthroscopic view and had to switch to a semi-open procedure with additional external fixateurs.	1.109974630761019
Arthroscopically assisted treatment of distal intraarticular fractures is not only useful to detect and manage additional carpal lesions, but seems to give good midterm results as well.	1.0652189423774527
Antitachycardia pacing techniques (ATP) have proved useful for termination of ventricular tachycardia (VT).	0.8791940417594681
However, little is known about the efficacy and safety off ATP during long-term follow-up in a larger study population.	1.1831321214426092
We analyzed the data of 80 ICD patients (pts) with spontaneous monormorphic VT, mean age 59  +/-  12 years, the mean follow-up was 26  +/-  17 months.	1.264159597904852
50 pts (62.5%) had coronary artery disease, 18 (22.5%) dilative cardiomyopathy (DCM), the remaining 12 pts (15%) had no or other cardiac diseases.	1.2232614884832986
2926 episodes of ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 349  +/-  51 ms, 240-520 ms) occurred in 64/80 pts (80%), overall efficacy of ATP was 89.9%, acceleration occurred in 4.1% of VTs.	1.1268250910862252
Success of ATP did not correlate with positive ATP testing on induced arrhythmias, LVEF, NYHA class or aneurysm.	0.8273840672972606
Neither underlying heart disease nor antiarrhythmic medication had an impact on the ATP success rate.	0.7584613451840919
ATP efficacy was linked significantly to short VT cycle length (VTCL, 240-300 ms, p < 0.01) and long coupling intervals (91-97%), p < 0.01).	0.8759933731058991
Acceleration occurred in 32% of pts and in 4.1% of VT episodes; it was also dependent on short VT cycle length (< 300 ms vs > 300 ms, p < 0.04) and short coupling intervals (< 81% vs >= 81%, p <= 0.01).	1.321488458956469
Methodological work was performed in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) in order to develop suitable tools for non-invasive characterization of hematopoetic bone marrow.	1.0236111324333017
The methods were applied for the assessment of normal values in healthy persons and to examine patients with generalized hematological diseases or to monitor effects of therapies influencing the composition of bone marrow.	1.0900632071323493

Discussion: Pure text-based clinical results do not allow sufficient evalutation for quality assurance and medical performance documentation.	0.9622162973372298
However, a computer-based and immediate documentation in outpatients' departments should not mean a significantly increased workload for physicians.	1.0392370612961643
Hydromorphone is a µ receptor agonist opioid.	0.632473834679711
According to WHO recommendations, hydromorphone is to be classified in step III of pain therapy.	0.9306542516419368
An oral formulation with a prolonged duration of action of 12 hours has been evaluated only recently.	0.976036417415967
The controlled release capsule is especially suited for the regular twice a day administration in cases of severe and persistent pain.	1.0405822114917873
The oral formulation of hydromorphone increases the number of opioid analgesics available for pain therapy in step III.	0.9385995038592148
Hydromorphone is recommended when morphine fails to produce sufficient pain relief (despite increase of doses) or causes intolerable side effects (despite treatment of symptoms).	0.9812768692528272
In principle, no differences in efficacy of morphine and hydromorphone are to be expected.	1.0216156509431251
However, clinical experience shows that changing one opioid analgesic to another one can improve the treatment of patients so that hydromorphone may replace another opioid analgesic to which a patient fails to respond well or develops side effects.	1.17956958691159
The dose of hydromorphone equivalent to 2 times 30 mg controlled release morphine is about 2 times 4 mg.	0.9563612192199511
The values for the absorption, bioavailability and maximum plasma concentration after the administration of controlled release hydromorphone every 12 hours -of three times the dose- are equivalent to those of an immediate release tablet given every 4 hours.	1.1015313745238493
In several open label and controlled studies, hydromorphone proved to be of good efficacy in the treatment of acute and persistent pain, especially in patients with severe cancer pain.	1.1804824066030744
With regard to the incidence of side effects, no significant differences between morphine and hydromorphone could be established.	1.077971418251055
In general, the side effects of hydromorphone are typical for opioid analgesics.	0.9823566568590949
In 63 patients, 82 elevations of the maxillary sinus were performed.	0.913122574301682
As augmentation, materials autografts from the iliac crest (combined with alveolar ridge augmentations in 16 sinus lifts) were transplanted in 39 cases and osteoinductive, allogeneic bone powder (AAA bone (autolyzed, antigen-extracted, allogeneic bone): n = 8, DFDBA (demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft) and/or GraftonTM (demineralized bone matrix gel): n = 35) were used in 43 cases.	1.0162983176238984
Some 4-6 months after implantation, osteoinductive, allogeneic (demineralized) bone implants showed radio-opaque areas as an equivalent of bone formation.	1.1175757171376812
Histological examinations revealed that osteoinductive implants were completely transformed into patients' own bone tissue.	0.8610945841103049
The average augmentation height after autograft transplantations was 14 ( +/-  3) mm in comparison with 9 ( +/-  3) mm after allograft implantations.	1.0630080835799942
Histologically as well as radiologically no differences of the bone quality could be determined between the two augmentation materials.	1.1576476084466718
Endoscopic controls showed, in both groups, nonirritated mucous membranes.	0.8986251695671016
On an average 2 endosseous implants (Bone LockR or ITIR-screw implants) were inserted into the augmentated maxillary sinus floors in both groups.	0.9262836002590166
No osseointegration was achieved in 4 out of 67 dental implants when bone autografts were used and in 2 out of 74 dental implants of the allogeneic bone group.	1.026514904471621
Patients with bone autografts suffered from postoperative complaints on an average of 19 ( +/-  9) days (without consideration of 2 patients with postoperative complaints persisting for more than 90 days).	1.166899674283485
The average postoperative complaints of recipients of allogeneic bone implants continued for 3 ( +/-  5) days.	1.1158619353765165
The 13 patients who underwent an ambulant sinus lift procedure with allogeneic bone powder were already symptom-free several hours after the operation.	1.0352465883504682
Under critical consideration of all investigated parameters, osteoinductive bone implants are preferable to iliac bone autografts for maxillary sinus augmentations in those cases in which no additional alveolar ridge augmentation is required.	0.9083732769671573
We describe a patient with a primary renal plasmacytoma.	1.2137248038351145
In the literature available, only six clinical cases have been reported.	1.1807856280201376
A 64-year-old patient is presented who had the clinical signs of a renal cell carcinoma.	1.2537805949272525
Histological examination after nephrectomy, however, revealed a plasmacytoma.	1.1621844059829953
Based on this case, we discuss how one should proceed in this disease.	1.0845614395025187
Primary renal plasmacytoma can be tentatively diagnosed preoperatively only in the presence of paraproteinemia or Bence-Jones proteinuria, as it cannot be distinguished from other renal tumors by imaging procedures.	0.9909756586764534
Postoperatively, further staging procedures must rule out bone involvement (solitary myeloma or multiple myeloma).	0.8937703282723849
Nephrectomy is required in patients with plasmacytoma only if renal complications occur.	0.7427400700268619
Dissection of the ascending aorta (type A) following later after aortic valve replacement has been described with increasing frequency.	1.0926529426399052
This study analyzes the role of aortic valve replacement for the evolution of late dissection.	0.9478418826044431
Between December 1986 and November 1995, 222 patients with 225 acetabular fractures were treated operatively by three surgeons in the Department of Traumatology and Emergency Surgery of the University Hospitals of the Catholic University of Leuven.	1.0651238977824444
Indications for surgery were unstable fracture, displaced fracture through the acetabular dome and fracture with intra-acetabular fracture fragments.	0.8982359322121575
There were 37.3% A-fractures, 49.7% B-fractures, and 13% C fractures according to the AO Classification.	1.169151291902406
In 16.4% of fractures there were primary neurological deficits.	1.112986698991938
Patients were treated operatively after an average of 5.0 days.	1.4460701288123823
The Kocher-Langenbeck approach was used in 56.9% of cases, the ilio-inguinal approach in 27.1% and the extended iliofemoral approach in 4%.	1.1730726217013503
In 7.1% of patients, a primary total hip endoprosthesis was implanted.	1.1358230207192435
There was no intra- oder perioperative mortality.	0.9108214542154374
The average hospital stay was 26.1 days.	0.9593986966550221
In 7.1% of patients, we noted secondary neurological problems.	1.1079442531446884
Deep infections were present in 1.3%.	0.8867641844880328
In 11.1% of patients a second operative procedure was necessary.	1.3316506387029001
We were able to review 175 patients after an average of 2 years.	0.8670359214224862
Signs of arthrosis and periarticular ossification were noted on the x-rays: walking distance, hip mobility and pain intensity were asked about and recorded after the clinical examination.	1.0774584927839304
In 76% of patients an excellent or good result on the Merle-d'Aubigne scale was obtained.	1.1109240425111757
T-fractures and posterior wall fractures were followed by the worst results.	1.0227029585256773
During this 9-year period, changes have been made to the preoperative radiological examination carried out, the choice of operative approach and our policy on prevention of thrombosis prophylaxis and postoperative ossification.	1.2144417203749212
After thorough preoperative diagnosis and with a meticulous operative technique, it is possible to stabilise the vast majority of acetabular fractures through the three classical approaches.	1.1371725916768898
Because the fractures are relatively rare, their diagnosis complex and their surgical treatment difficult, specific training is essential for every acetabular surgeon.	1.1470129076841058
Diagnostic pitfalls exist when benign salivary gland diseases are mistakenly classified as malignant, with consequences for treatment and prognosis.	0.9925452824347178
Examples are necrotizing sialometaplasia, metaplastic Warthin tumour and sclerosing polycystic sialadenopathy.	0.7043189736615129
The proper diagnosis is of eminent importance to distinguish cases of primary tumours that have developed in salivary glands or their lymph nodes from cases of extraglandular tumours with metastases in these glands or their nodes.	1.011959863847252
In these cases clinical data and additional immunocytochemical methods are necessary to clarify the exact diagnosis, especially when the primary salivary gland tumours have a structure largely identical to the metastases (e.g.	1.0316960592322362
Nasopharyngeal or cervical chordomas can be mistaken for pleomorphic adenoma or mucinous adenocarcinoma.	0.7186424027827825
The initial stage of malignant MALT lymphomas in association with Sjögren's syndrome demands identification of clonal rearrangement for therapeutic implication.	0.7983718426338455
The diagnostic criteria for proper classification are analysed in detail.	0.8149163212735729
A 59-year-old male patient was transnasally operated on because of a pituitary adenoma with hypopituitarism.	0.923649571176216
A second operation and X-ray therapy followed a half year later due to recurrent tumor.	0.9894240962074369
Both neoplasmas were classified as sparsely granulated prolactin cell adenomas.	0.6000507336620226
Immunohistochemical studies revealed strong immunoreactivity for prolactin and FSH in the tumor cells of both the pituitary adenoma and the recurrent tumor.	1.1063113421271689
Two years later the prolactin plasma levels were extremely elevated.	0.8265633514564086
A tumor in the liver was identified.	0.844433361223945
Biopsy revealed a solid endocrine tumor containing prolactin by immunohistology.	0.6968159415244561
Due to structural and immunohistological similarities this tumor could be identified as a metastasis of the pituitary tumor.	0.9547219845402457
After 5 months of therapy the patient died from thrombembolism.	1.2394226816315
Post-mortem studies confirmed the diagnosis of a metastasizing prolactin-secreting pituitary carcinoma.	0.9331409143943541
Only six similar cases have been reported in the literature.	0.6474351857576008
Our case report confirms the experience with 35 definite pituitary carcinomas reparted in the current literature: malignant pituitary tumors develop after pituitary surgery and can be identified not from the pituitary tumor, but only from its metastases.	1.1461449648655333
Paraneoplastic markers in tumor patients may occur at various stages of the disease.	0.8939235862990277
While some disorders almost invariably herald an underlying malignancy (obligative marker), most only occasionally do so (facultative marker).	1.0236575929818648
The association of bullous pemphigoid with malignancy is controversial.	0.6997897964951156
There are only a few reports of bullous pemphigoid associated with a renal cell carcinoma.	0.857891722318453
We diagnosed a renal cell carcinoma in a 74 year old female patient, admitted to the hospital because of bullous pemphigoid.	0.889516502257092
Multiple metastases were found in her lymph nodes, liver, lung and skeleton.	1.1150740392832195
The patient died eleven weeks after the first symptoms of bullous pemphigoid appeared.	1.1810268475868178
Acute compartment syndrome of the thigh has been infrequently reported in the literature.	0.763350608236581
Closed femoral fractures and blunt soft tissue trauma are the main causes of this injury.	1.0860061424392675
The multiple injured patient in this case report developed a compartment syndrome of the thigh after intramedullary nailing of a comminuted fracture of the femur.	1.0552071871884396
Fasciotomy was performed two days after surgery because of extense swelling of the thigh in the ventilated and sedated patient.	0.8780585390519655
Sciatic and femoral nerve palsy was recognized after extubation of the patient nine days after the injury.	1.0568268810781598
During the following weeks the paresis of the femoral nerve recovered but neither motor nor sensory function of the sciatic nerve could be demonstrated.	1.0433477614805
Therefore an operative revision of the sciatic nerve was performed eighteen weeks after trauma.	0.7702003033316603
No direct nerve injury could be detected but there were adhesions around the nerve as a sign of compression neuropathy caused by the compartment syndrome.	0.9795973444566287
The tibial component of the sciatic nerve showed a complete recovery within the next months but there was a persisting peroneal nerve palsy.	1.0699905404055856
Conclusion: Early clinical symptoms of a compartment syndrome like pain, paresthesia and paresis can not be ascertained in a ventilated and sedated patient.	0.984167289298303
Tense swelling of the muscles is often the only detectable sign.	0.8871155524936465
Frequent measurements of compartment pressure should be done in these patients.	0.8672958114669197
We suggest early decompressive fasciotomy because the morbidity caused by fasciotomy in a borderline compartment syndrome is far outweighed by the morbidity that accompanies an undiagnosed untreated compartment syndrome with possible nerve palsy.	0.900798626372757
Aim: The long-term effect of DNase with cystic fibrosis was examined.	0.8580394195005858
Teeth are most important for the identification of unknown cadavers.	0.7332566738557372
The police publish difficult cases of unidentified bodies in dental print media.	0.6961581361078415
Using their records such as x-rays or documented dental work dentists can often recognize an unknown person and thus contribute to the identification.	0.9523762904095842
To evaluate the efficency of this procedure 177 cases published between 1975 and 1995 were examined.	0.9835214529527159
Only 3% of the examined cases could be identified due to a reaction to publishing in the dental print media.	1.0995451346244567
To improve the presentation of identification cases in the dental print media 500 dentists were asked to take part in a survey.	0.9127146055066759
According to these results a new concept of presentation sould be developed to improve the efficency of this odontoforensic method.	0.9813759279637753
New technological possibilities such as digital x-raying or online data transfer could open new ways for forensic identification.	0.7584743675102801
In a fatality after oral intake of a large amount of an insecticide spray consisting of propoxur, tetramethrine and the solvents isopropanol and benzyl alcohol, a coagulation nectrotic fixation of the oesophagus and stomach were the main morphological findings.	0.9507532608979268
The concentrations determined by HPLC and GC/MS in femoral blood, liver, kidney, vitreous humor and liquor were in the comatose lethal range for propoxur (< 0.3-18 µg/g), whereas tetrametrin (up to 0.1 µg/g) was almost completely decomposed.	1.121840601570404
The propoxur decomposition product o-isopropoxyphenol (2.8-56 µg/g), benzyl alcohol (18-58 µg/g) and its oxydation product benzoic acid (85-140 µg/g), isopropanol (0.45-1.1 mg/g) and acetone (0.01-0.03 mg/g) were also found.	1.2983745477814255
On the other hand, the concentrations in heart blood and lung tissue were up to 30 times higher.	0.992185589149298
As a reason for these immense concentration differences an agonale aspiration of the highly concentrated liquid stomach content after vomiting immediately before death is discussed.	0.8587422648346654
The extent of the metabolization of propoxur to o-isopropoxyphenol and of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid, which is assumed to proceed mainly postmortem, was quite different in the materials investigated and was almost complete in the liver.	1.0882365963339973
The intoxication by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor propoxur in combination with the neurotoxic effect of tetramethrine was determined as the cause of death.	0.8848478697740975
Background: Despite the fact that deep lamellar keratoplasty (DLKP) is less invasive than to penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), this procedure is rarely performed.	1.3212337574002033
We therefore investigated whether or not the DLKP technique we employed can achieve stable improvement of visual acuity.	0.8339414453027428
Palmoplantar keratodermia (PPK) varians and PPK punctata are considered different entities within the group of hereditary palmoplantar keratodermas.	0.8235026256894501
Keratosis punctata of the palmar creases constitutes a localized form of keratodermia palmoplantaris punctata.	0.7740880853799994
We describe a 31-year-old man exhibiting both nummular and papular keratoses on the soles, as well as small punctate keratoses confined to the palmar creases.	0.9841769151403794
In view of the co-occurrence of these two types of PPK, the question arises whether keratosis palmoplantaris of the varians and the punctate type represent distinct entities or represent variable manifestations of the same gene defect.	1.0643925203844986
The author gives a synoptic view on the paths and routes of emigration the jewish and/or political reasons persecuted psychoanalysts had to take in order to escape national socialist Germany.	0.8499311967662339
With reference to current studies on emigration, which for Germany differentiates three distinctive phases of emigration between 1933 and 1938, the immigration policy especially of the United States and Great Britain and its impact on the concrete circumstances and modalities for the emigration of the particular professional group of psychoanalysts is described and discussed.	1.0287939431970676
In this context, the major importance of the solidarity and help the refugees were granted by the international psychoanalytic community and performed in spite of partially major theoretical differences and institutional rivalries is emphasized.	1.0436185592736213
Acute suppurative thyroiditis is very rare in childhood.	0.7905048849309402
We describe the clinical signs and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of thyroid abscesses in children, and add 2 own cases of this rare disease.	1.2518035849869502
In the first case, diagnosis of piriform sinus fistula was made finally after repeated drainage for recurrent abscesses of the left thyroid.	1.239762643287521
Operative excision of the fistula was performed and the child is doing well since then.	1.0195173479542359
In the second case, a left sided thyroid abscess was treated by incision and drainage only.	1.1385691287197213
Seven years later, no recurrent abscess occurred in this child.	0.9738050520234528
In conclusion, especially in left sided and recurrent thyroid abscesses the patients should be examined for a piriform sinus fistula as a route of infection.	1.1405978696629455
If present, complete removal of the fistula is essential for permanent cure.	1.1245062713868903
The importance of spiral-CT is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors.	0.4911276634169387
Its importance for follow-up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors.	0.5413971412368318
Using spiral-CT multiple signs of alterations (n=98) can be diagnosed, which are not only important for tumour relapse, but also for assessment.	0.8593329620925828
Spiral-CT offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy.	0.4802409930616585
In follow-up examinations after radiation, laryngoscopy and spiral-CT are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath-holding technique (separately reconstructed) and also as functional spiral-CT of the vocal cords in "I"-phonation.	0.6227970554241586
Simpson in Scotland was the first to describe the administration of ether for analgesia in painful deliveries.	0.9658723716927692
Only a few days later E.C.J.	1.0759044540197857
von Siebold (*1801 in Würzburg - \dagger1861 in Göttingen) performed the first systematic study on ether in obstetrics.	1.1824047205557975
Following a preceding evaluation of the action of ether on non-pregnant woman and on pregnant women not in active labour, he administered ether for analgesia during the second stage of labour in eight parturients.	0.9992402808030505
The first administration was on February 25th 1847.	0.6368956035008848
While he was satisfied with the good analgesia without sequelae of the new-born, he was discouraged by the termination of uterine contractions observed in all his patients.	1.0993239182736882
He concluded that ether was not a useful substance for analgesia during vaginal delivery, since it disturbed the natural course of labour.	1.0264165376275718
On the other hand, von Siebold was very pleased with the administration of ether for operative obstetric procedures such as forceps deliveries or placental retention.	0.8181127911219973
Background: Mode switching aims to maintain a ventricular rhythm that matches metabolic needs during both sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias.	1.1047112979006999
This allows patients with atrial arrhythmias to benefit from AV synchronous pacing modes.Aim and method: Beat-to-beat mode switching in Diamond and Clarity pacemakers is designed to maintain a relatively stable ventricular rhythm, ensuring consistent ventricular filling patterns.	0.9925011566946624
Atrial tachyarrhythmia detection is based on a continuous analysis of the atrial rhythm.	1.1433449240135363
A too rapid increase of the atrial rate with a beat-to-beat acceleration > 15 bpm is considered to be an atrial tachyarrhythmia.	1.1719619656764864
Mode switching occurs on detection of the first premature atrial event: atrial tracking is stopped and the ventricular rate is determined by the rate indicated by the dual sensor (QT interval and activity).	0.9922882006721385
Atrial pacing restores AV synchrony immediately after cessation of the atrial tachyarrhythmia, effectively avoiding retrograde conduction.	0.9037656397641505
Dedicated diagnostic functions allow one to monitor the incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias and to study atrial and ventricular events just prior to its onset.	1.0176052035438716
Both the mode switching and rate responsive function are fully automatic, rendering follow-up procedures easy and less time-consuming.	1.0516152223374902
Conclusion: Reliable detection of all atrial events is essential to guarantee appropriate mode switching.	1.1417431368472248
Therefore, the pacemaker stores the distribution of the amplitude of all atrial events, both during sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias, which facilitates the appropriate programming of the atrial sensitivity.	1.2355288300453784
Introduction: Mediastinal diseases are mostly diagnosed by CT and MRI.	1.185391332305057
The applicability of ultrasound is limited by the surrounding air- and bone-containing thorax, which permits only restricted echo windows.	1.1700724074147142
Transesophageal endoscopic ultrasonography circumvents this problem and ensures visualization of parts of the mediastinum.	0.728598476730115
Blood glucose alterations prior to cerebral ischaemia are associated with poor neurologic outcome, possibly due to extensive lactic acidosis or energy failure.	0.9459023532790758
Cerebral effects of hyper- or hypoglycaemia during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are less well known.	0.9557999079914262
In addition, little information is available concerning cardiac effects of blood glucose alterations.	1.2071486229491903
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pre-cardiac-arrest hypo- or hyperglycaemia compared to normoglycaemia upon haemodynamics, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism (CMRO2), and regional cardiac blood flow during CPR subsequent to 3 min of cardiac and respiratory arrest and after restoration of spontaneous circulation.	0.9931267447602599
After approval by the State Animal Investigation Committee, 29 mechanically ventilated, anaesthetised pigs were instrumented for haemodynamic monitoring and blood flow determination by the radiolabeled microsphere technique.	0.9485814337772326
The animals were randomly assigned to one of three groups: in group I (n=9) blood glucose was not manipulated; in group II (n=10) blood glucose was increased by slow infusion of 40% glucose to 319 +/- 13 mg/dl; in group III (n=10) blood glucose was lowered by careful titration with insulin to 34 +/- 2 mg/dl.	1.1447966045837572
After 3 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation and respiratory arrest, CPR (chest compressor/ventilator (Thumper) and epinephrine infusion) was commenced and continued for 8 min.	1.0183577773302281
Thereafter, defibrillation was attempted, and if successful, the animals were observed for another 240 min.	1.2594677245560726
Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), CBF, CMRO2, coronary perfusion pressure (CorPP), and regional cardiac blood flow were determined at control, after 3 min of CPR, and at 10, 30, and 240 min post-CPR.	1.1830280893834908
In group I, 4/9 animals (44%) could be successfully resuscitated; in group II 4/10 (40%); and in group III 0/10 (0%).	1.2896991449267727
Prior to cardiac arrest, mean arterial pressure, CPP, and CorPP in group III were significantly lower compared to groups I and II.	1.0996458345626552
In group I, CPP during CPR was 26 +/- 6 mmHg; CBF 31 +/- 9 ml/min/100 g CMRO2 3.8 +/- 1.2 ml/min/100 g; CorPP 18 +/- 5 mmHg; and left ventricular (LV) flow 35 +/- 15 ml/min/100 g. In group II: CPP=21 +/- 5; CBF 21 +/- 7; CMRO2 1.8 +/- 0.8; CorPP 16 +/- 6; and LV flow 22 +/- 9; and in group III: CPP 15 +/- 3; CBF 11 +/- 8; CMRO2 1.5 +/- 1.1; CorPP 4 +/- 2; and LV flow 19 +/- 10.	1.1199969940798165
During the 240-min post-resuscitation period, there were no differences in CBF, CMRO2, or LV flow between groups I and II.	1.0142829455175144
Hypoglycaemia prior to cardiac arrest appears to be predictive for a poor cardiac outcome, whereas hyperglycaemia does not impair resuscitability compared to normoglycaemia.	1.0008274549934897
In addition, hyperglycaemia did not affect LV flow, CBF, or CMRO2.	1.0667158121874685
However, it has to be kept in mind that haemodynamics and organ blood flow do not permit conclusions with respect to functional neurologic recovery or histopathologic damage to the brain, which is very likely to be associated with hyperglycaemia.	1.2122946083464716
Abstract  We present an algorithm for the rational diagnosis of glutaric aciduria type I (GA1).	0.9506975640737985
Normal urinary organic acids in patients with non-specific clinical features and normal results of brain imaging render the diagnosis highly unlikely, and no further investigations are required.	1.1014321661192243
In other patients, the diagnostic strategy depends on the individual clinical, neuroradiological and biochemical findings.	1.1778297479099833
GCDH enzyme analysis should be reserved for patients in whom GA1 is very likely.	0.8498650940304906
This article gives a brief review of the history of spinal surgery from the end of the nineteenth century up to our own time.	0.9492866894969564
Malignant lymphomas, originating from peripheral T or NK cells, are rare tumours in Europe and account for less than 10% of all malignant lymphomas.	1.2073652265336503
In this review, the salient features of the more frequently occurring entities derived from T or NK cells will be presented.	0.9605031266066283
Nasal NK/T cell lymphoma is mainly found in the nose and paranasal sinuses and often, but not always, display an angiocentric growth pattern leading to coagulation necrosis.	1.092988021994928
The tumor cells consistently express CD56, CD2 and the EBER molecules encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus.	0.8324427496238143
Clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangements are often absent indicating, in the majority of cases, a derivation of these tumors from NK cells.	1.1081905571330128
Enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphomas often arise in patients with celiac disease and have a dismal prognosis.	1.0527738923689334
The tumour cells express T cell antigens, CD103 and cytotoxic molecules, but are negative for CD4.	1.0520278416506164
Approximately 20% of the cases display CD56 mostly in combination with CD8.	1.0066762827384064
Recently, an early purely intraepithelial form of this tumour was identified.	1.281853569870055
Histologically these cases resemble celiac disease, however the intraepithelial lymphocytes often exhibit an abnormal immunophenotype with absent CD8 and T-cell-receptor protein expression, and, they are clonal by molecular analysis.	1.1125433775829099
Clinically, the patients suffer from refractory sprue or ulcerative jejunitis.	0.9770697127276665
The prognosis is bad with the patients often dying from malnutrition or an invasive tumour-forming T-cell lymphoma.	1.0501387619330582
Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is defined by characteristic morphological findings (atypical lymphoid cells in part with pale cytoplasm, arborizing high endothelial venules and large FDC-meshworks) as well as clinical features (systemic symptoms, signs of a dysregulated immune response).	0.9776091098624321
Peripheral T-cell lymphomas, that do not fit into a distinct entity, are classified in the REAL and the new WHO classifications as peripheral T-cell lymphomas unspecified.	1.143340531826043
These display a broad morphological spectrum (including the T-cell lymphomas of different cell sizes, Lennert's lymphoma and T-zone lymphoma of the Kiel-classification) and in general are clinically aggressive.	1.2015414842925816
Causes and courses of the diseases are subjected to a change of an increasing life expectancy on the one hand and technically highly developed medicine on the other hand.	1.060320637966316
Since a growing number of elderly people is denying intensive medical interventions which serve the purpose of keeping them alive despite severe diseases, the problem of euthanasia imposes direct questions.	1.0501112603127607
A central role is played by the active-passive difference and its moralistic legitimacy.	0.9240851592031515
The difficulties of this difference are discussed below on the applicable level of ethical discussions.	0.8944596021604673
At the same time, knowledge of the danger is being made aware that in a maximal therapeutical orientated medical care system the desire for euthanasia may become identical with the reverse side of this care system.	0.9401682434838806
Isolated severe head trauma (SHT) or SHT in combination with multiple injuries are important factors for the prognosis of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from the consequences of accidents.	1.1239868811789395
The prognosis mainly depends on the presence of primary mechanic brain injury and the development of secondary brain damage.	0.8350968725968343
Causes for the development of secondary brain damage are the intracranial space demand after traumatic injury and edema formation which may result in iscemia, as well as inflammatory processes.	0.8299570095559778
Both isolated SHT and polytrauma with or without brain damage may result in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to the synthesis of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators which may cause a single or multiple organ failure (MOF).	0.996670418582395
Often the organism is able to survive isolated traumatic injuries and functional disturbances, but in combination or cumulation they may be lethal.	1.0954339674120128
The hypermetabolism after SHT is often regarded as an interaction between the central nervous system and the whole organism by the activation of the neuroendocrine axis.	1.005790162886345
In contrast to the consequences of SHT for the whole organism, multiple injuries after polytrauma may affect brain functions, such as the shock dependent disturbance of the brain perfusion accompanied by brain hypoxia which may lead to an aggravated prognosis.	1.128979339337684
Moreover, coagulation, metabolism and fracture healing are influenced by the onset of SIRS as well.	1.0343093706399253
Our knowledge about the bidirectional inflammatory interaction between brain and whole organism is still limited.	0.9345497207095074
In this context, the effects of secondary surgical interventions which may additionally stress a traumatized body have to be considered and are the subject for actual clinical discussions and experimental studies.	1.0865088382066934
This article tries to summarize some important aspects on this topic.	0.6491535157214735
Background: Chronic cough and thoracic pain, commonly caused by upper airway infections, are frequently seen symptoms in pediatrics.	1.218402396049736
These "benign" symptoms are very seldom caused by malignant disorders.	0.8553638385641325
Methods: In two patients (male, age 41/12 and 43/12 years) chronic cough and thoracic pain were due to a malignant pulmonary neoplasm (Pleuropulmonary blastoma).	1.0778799431686912
Results: Pleuropulmonary blastoma is a rare malignant primary pulmonary neoplasm in childhood with a poor prognosis.	1.1221950104284317
An incomplete resection was performed in both cases.	1.0696692054578654
Both patients received postoperative radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy.	0.7514026934118071
One boy died, the other one is alive and well more than 6 years after diagnosis without evidence of disease.	1.2196278307736126
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that even after incomplete resection subsequent multimodal therapy (adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy) can provide a long term remission.	1.1599313148880246
In 12 patients with systemic sclerosis the influence of hypnosis and autogenic training on the acral blood circulation and the coping with the disease was investigated in a pilot study.	1.1069820114874949
In the first step significant increases in the skin temperature of the fingers (mean +/- SD: 3.9 +/- 1.2  °C) could be found after relaxation hypnosis.	1.2380277213765913
In the second step six patients (study group) gained experience with autogenic training.	0.9704202238405298
The other six patients served as control group.	0.5510590477022933
In the study group, the skin temperature of the fingers (short-term effect) was significantly higher than in the control group (1.9 +/- 1.0  °C).	1.2386244017123784
Long-term effects of the autogenic training (mean acral rewarning time, duration and course of the Raynaud attacks, acral lesions of the hands, psychosomatic status of complaints, type of relation to the disease as precondition for coping with the disease) were not found within the relatively short follow-up period of 4 months.	1.2838510049117544
Two patients, however, reported that they could shorten the duration of Raynaud attacks by autogenic training.	0.9929527028704724
In our patients heterogenicity and an increased score of multiple psychosomatic complaints were registered at the outset.	1.0315235862982837
As far as the type of relation to the disease is concerned, the patients could be assessed as almost adapted.	1.261622973711389
Hypnosis and autogenic training can be recommended as complementary therapy in systemic sclerosis.	0.9194136647574825
Abstract The term acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) reflects an acute worsening of the stable state with an increase in dyspnea, cough, and count or purulence of sputum.	0.952747823785875
The management of an acute exacerbation is guided mainly clinical severity which has implications on the decision of outpatient management, hospital management or intensive care treatment.	1.0930389209883662
Cardiopulmonary comorbidity and the number of previous exacerbations are prognostic factors.	0.6901094048404178
The first-line therapy of each exacerbation is the intensification of drug-treatment with 2-agonists and anticholinergics.	1.057703309793695
Systemic steroids as a short-term course are advocated if hospital-treatment is necessary.	1.0707419498011341
Infections of the respiratory tract are a frequent cause of acute exacerbations.	1.1279995677854233
However, a colonization with potential pathogenic microorganisms is found in many patients in the stable state.	1.1960950820882557
Antibiotic treatment is justified if cardiopulmonary comorbidity and frequent previous exacerbations are present.	0.9297242493497843
The severity of airflow obstruction and the frequency of previous exacerbations are linked to the spectrum of the underlying microorganisms.	0.9952917287474617
This should be borne in mind for the choice of the antimicrobiotic treatment.	1.0295497872835064
Noninvasive ventilation in severe exacerbation is able to improve gas-exchange and to reduce the work of breathing.	0.8715528044457883
As a consequence the number of intubations and the attributable morbidity and mortality are reduced.	1.1112020076121945
If invasive mechanical ventilation is necessary, the potential of dynamic hyperinflation in acute exacerbation has to be considered.	1.0568165022337235
Background: In 1986 Prof. H. Olbing (University of Essen Pediatrics Department), supported by Prof. G. Stickler (Mayo Medical School, Minnesota), introduced a 4-weeks clinical skills lab for all students (annual class 250), based on self-instruction by means of computer-assisted, interactive, audiovisual learning materials, models, bedside teaching and seminars on special topics (partially peer-guided).	1.0630849833720306
Each year 14 chosen senior medical students get a two weeks intensive training in order to function as peer tutors for the bedside teaching.	0.8793936583667967
The peer tutors train the junior students in basic behaviour and clinical examination skills.	0.7781478821117117
Each tutor is active during 4-5 skills lab periods, and in each period he/she coaches two groups of two students each.	1.0919169827046544
During the bedside teaching phase each group examines and presents four patients.	0.6611151667883253
Spinal injuries referring to banal falls are common injuries in elderly persons.	0.7801299043908482
Up to 55 years of age spinal fractures are more frequent in men while its opposite in older persons.	0.9567545790812815
There are two typical lesions: odontoid fracture in the upper cervical spine and compression fracture in thoracolumbar spine.	1.0463632670647367
Odontoid fracture is the most frequent lesion in cervical spine in the elderly.	1.097719635969839
This is caused by trabecular structure of dens axis and spine's stiffness in old age.	0.6886848475766201
Instable fractures in extension type II are most common.	0.8778305599613236
In many cases the instability of the lesion is hidden and can be first seen in functional examination controlled by x-ray.	0.9894073658659522
Conservative treatment is efficient in stable lesions type III while there is a high risk for pseudarthrosis in treatment of instable lesions in elderly with Halo Fixateur e. g. We think that the best operation for these fractures is the anterior screw fixation.	1.10776434067226
If this is not sufficient because of low bone mass or early dislocation of the screws a dorsal fusion C1/C2 with transarticular screwing e. g. should be done.	1.064427084427888
Because of rare symptoms thoracolumbar fractures in osteoporosis are hidden frequently.	0.7490178246292234
In many cases it's not easy to distinguish acute lesions from healed fractures or tumor lesions.	0.9144106594119056
Therefore there are just few compression fractures (A type) that have to be treated operatively.	1.2291492736884588
Instable lesions type B and C must be operated as well in the elderly as in the young.	1.1646343940335195
Because of low bone mass in elderly the dorsal instrumentation should include more than just the two injured segments.	0.8586911343190039
An even more adequate stabilisation is done with an additional vertebral replacement.	0.9045212554555531
Following curative minimal-invasive laser resection of T1-T3 laryngeal carcinomas, patients were subjected to an intensive voice rehabilitation.	1.0003452018525498
Therapy was effected twice a day for approximately 2 months, utilizing the concept of functional voice therapy.	0.8753294910241817
Before and after rehabilitation, acoustic analyses were made by using two different computer-supported measuring systems: (1) the "multidimensional voice program" (Kay Elementrics Corp.) and (2) a novel software program developed in Göttingen that includes a new voice quality parameter based on correlations between frequency bands.	1.098690397673753
Acoustic analyses showed superiority of the glottal versus supraglottal compensatory phonation.	0.7143979840132152
Findings showed that not all acoustic parameters equally documented voice improvement after rehabilitation.	0.8117261626940163
The standard deviation of fundamental frequency was the only parameter showing a significant post-therapeutic improvement.	0.8587800384793673
A further suitable acoustic method proved to be the voice quality parameter that has been newly introduced by us.	0.9593717095169803
In contrast to analogous parameters of other methods, this approach is independent of the exact periodicity of the glottal excitation function, thus permitting reliable results to be obtained even with aphonic or heavily dysphonic voices.	1.08004408404878
Aseptic pseudarthrosis may occur after all kinds of traumatology treatment.	0.7777877079220752
Following conservative treatment, incomplete immobilisation or an unattached bone fragment can be causal.	0.7341766967034625
After plate osteosynthesis the biomechanical principles are not efficient or the circulatory damage delays healing.	0.8670584213946778
There are two broad types of pseudarthrosis: vascular and nonvascular.	0.9700023927644718
The extent of vascularisation can be demonstrated by bone scintigraphy as well as X-ray.	0.9961190286400385
The treatment of vascular nonunions is very common.	0.9639373252902858
Mechanical stability is required, therefore a new osteosynthesis is desirable.	1.0967519344172207
Osteoporosis caused by inactivity and dislocation increases the rate of complications.	0.8016081980554906
Much more difficult problems are encountered in treatment of unreactive and avital pseudarthrosis, particularly in cases with a defect of bone substance.	1.0975026325842845
These defects can be treated with a segment transfer and a fibula-to-tibia operation.	1.0270881131660667
Extracorporal lithotripsy has been established as a new method in treatment of active and vascular nonunions.	1.143765791435493
Former osteosynthesis is not a contraindication.	0.9109108514924521
Stability and immobilisation are necessary.	0.5234362020841601
Treatment in the low-frequency magnetic field shows no effect.	0.9579893551108528
Correct biomechanical and biological osteosynthesis with proper attention paid to location, quality of bone and asepsis can avoid the development of a pseudarthrosis.	1.0427097395061584
Aim of the study: The goal of this study was to assess the prevalence of ophthalmological abnormalities in 10 year old survivors with extremely low birthweight of 500-999 g. In addition the association between retinopathy of prematurity and other ophthalmological disorders was studied.	1.0473633472580988
Background: Although the majority of surgeons regard Hartmann's operation as therapeutic standard in perforations of the colon complicated by peritonitis this procedure has been critically discussed in recent years.	1.2928794815773557
Advocates of one-stage techniques criticized bad postoperative results (high morbidity and mortality) and long-term outcome (low rates of intestinal restoration).	1.2043610869798191
The aim of our study was to investigate whether the late results after Hartmann's operation justify this criticism.	0.9644465961075808
Method: From 1982 to 1997 Hartmann's operations were performed in 103 patients for colonic perforations.	1.1031257173702635
In 63 % of cases inflammatory diseases caused colonic complications.	1.1801791958604761
The average Mannheimer Peritonitis Index (MPI) was 19.	0.916377944116455
Seventeen patients died postoperatively (mortality: 16.5 %).	0.81002716164961
In 69 patients (80 %) intestinal restoration could be performed after an average interval of 122 days (complication rate: 6 %, no mortality).	1.3092272607883282
On follow-up, patients were asked to give information on their general state, changes of housing, abdominal complaints, and quality of life.	1.1025822786266255
Results: Data on 93 % of patients could be obtained.	1.352384369966637
The median follow-up time was 75 months.	0.8896245507354099
Eleven patients had died; the remaining 72 were investigated.	0.9965013900415903
86 % described the quality of their lives as good or very good; only 11 % indicated severe loss of activity.	1.0621886014582154
Quality of life did not differ between patients in whom intestinal continuity had been restored and those in whom it had not been restored.	1.122416431745408
Anastomotic strictures developed in 7 % of cases, always after stapled anastomosis.	0.964919351821675
Conclusions: According to our results, long-term outcome after Hartmann's operation is good.	1.2208727799678685
80 % of patients underwent intestinal restoration with low morbidity (6 %) and no mortality.	1.3722521576496647
A great majority of patients indicated the quality of their lives as good or very good: this assessment was not dependent on restoration of intestinal continuity.	0.9955640921585601
Tibial torsion defects are usually not clinically evident and, hence, are often overlooked.	1.0934300876433365
Clinical examination and CT scan have proved to be the best ways of measuring static tibial torsion, whereas dynamic measurements are usually performed in the clinic and the "gait laboratory."	1.1662653729193324
Only few studies have determined there to be a connection between a torsion defect in the lower leg and expected pathological conditions of the knee and ankle joints.	1.214122031825984
However, patellofemoral instability, Osgood-Schlatter disease, osteochondrosis dissecans are increasingly being found in cases of increased external tibial torsion and arthrosis in reduced torsion.	1.0757978692127201
The aim of this study was to ascertain to what extent homeless, mentally ill subjects in Munich take advantage of available psychosocial services.	0.9131771028105902
To obtain a representative picture of the situation, the first step was to ascertain how many people in Munich are actually homeless.	1.2235920665645628
The next step was to ascertain what proportion of them are in need of psychotherapy.	0.9849995207376099
Using the standardized Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), 146 men and 32 women were interviewed.	0.9999438228686579
The results according to the DSM-III demonstrated high lifelong and 6-month prevalence of psychic disturbances.	0.9832461276614592
Medical and social services were often enjoyed, but mostly over a short period of time in particularly critical situations.	1.0492706481042555
Women were treated more often than men.	0.7889407057271727
Elements such as age and level of education hardly influenced patients' seeking help.	0.8731572451027457
Despite a high prevalence of addictive disease, alcohol and drug clinics were rarely consulted.	0.883108373681396
The increase in the number of diagnoses was paralleled by an increase in the number of patients seeking help.	0.841127733603203
Most treatments involved schizophrenia and anxiety.	0.5486071396691357
By means of logistic regression models, predictors of the extent to which these services were used were analysed.	0.8979654317575625
We conclude that new clinical models are needed and that the aversion to the present care system is too great.	1.1466084235875027
Continued treatment occurs only rarely.	0.5056177710689164
Electrocardiographic and clinical characteristics are currently used as diagnostic criteria for the long QT-syndrome.	0.9510977001069224
In borderline electrocardiographic findings associated with unclear syncope, it is often difficult to ensure or exclude long QT-syndrome.	1.0279532846821446
Schwartz and coworkers therefore created a point system as a guide in clinical decision making.	0.7993155898279654
In recent years genetic diagnostics have entered the arena of long-QT assessment.	0.9132597337944154
Aside from new insights into the pathophysiology of the long QT-disorder, it is expected that genetic diagnostics will offer substantial help to ascertain long QT-syndrome in patients with borderline electrocardiographic and clinical findings and improve risk stratification in long-QT family members.	1.173798737224986
Performing linkage analysis, coupling of autosomal-dominant congenital long QT-syndrome (Romano-Ward Syndrome) to chromosomes 11 (LQT1/11p15.5), 3 (LQT3/3p21), 7 (LQT2/7q35), and 4 (LQT4/4q25-27) was demonstrated.	1.2149867948468929
More recently, the disease genes in long QT-syndrome 1, 2, and 3 could be identified.	1.5112908200321418
Analysis of the base-pair sequence allowed detection of several different mutations in different families illustrating genetic heterogeneity.	0.930808400993645
Aside from diagnostic aspects, molecular genetics may also guide pharmacological therapy by identifying the specific ion-channel disorder leading to QT-prolongation and sudden death.	0.8779175416000016
During the past 4 years we have demonstrated in eyes with corneal pathology that applanation tonometry (Goldmann, Perkins) generally delivers falsely low measurements in comparison to intraocular needle tonometry.	0.9130696960957236
The aim of this study was to evaluate whether impression tonometry (Schioetz) is more precise than applanation tonometry in determinating the intraocular pressure in eyes with corneal disorders.	1.0025489414900948
The case of a 24-year-old woman with a plunging ranula is reported.	0.9588848886445501
Primarily, the patient noticed extensive swelling of the neck, which had developed 3 months previously.	1.441867012025328
The polycystic, firmly attached tumor and the sublingual and submandibular glands of the right side of the neck were surgically removed.	1.0478814460242034
Pathological examination showed a retention cyst by means of a plunging ranula.	0.8631038730774038
The etiology, pathogenesis, clinical aspect and diagnostic procedures for the plunging ranula are described.	0.8919072627640169
Various therapeutic possibilities are discussed in regard to their value.	1.0950191184353715
We prefer surgical treatment with a histological examination to verify the diagnosis.	1.083297649980809
The plunging ranula originates on the sublingual gland; therefore, its simultaneous extirpation is recommended to avoid recurrences.	1.072071278365411
In extensive cases, the additional removal of the submandibular gland can be advised.	0.9737240844573513
Cranial dural fistulae are rare; when they occur, it is usually difficult to detect them at an early stage.	1.178574609390698
With a view to the question of possible progress in diagnosis we now report on seven patients with lateral dural fistulae fed by branches of the external carotid artery.	0.9693202278369647
The examination was carried out before selective arteriography using cw-Doppler sonography and colour coded duplex sonography in combination.	0.8979270497974596
Sonographic criteria for detection of hyperperfusion take account of flow velocity as well as pulsatility.	0.8146724889695406
In all cases hyperperfusion of the external carotid artery and the common carotid artery was detected.	0.9839337670608181
In most of these cases pathologic findings were also observed at the occipital artery, and more rarely in the contralateral external carotid artery or the ipsilateral vertebral artery, in addition.	1.3308263477141538
A possible source of error arising from confusion of blood vessels was present with the cw-Doppler sonography, but not for colour coded duplex sonography.	1.0797158977437384
Therefore, cranial dural fistulae characterized by a high shunt volume can be diagnosed correctly by indirect Doppler sonographic criteria using cw-Doppler and duplex sonography.	1.1773817619791695
Direct visualization of the fistula and its nidus requires additional selective arteriography, in the course of which endovascular embolization may be performed.	1.1064094431441303
Background: Echocardiography is a standard imaging technique for the assessment of heart valve disease.	1.2575301891964183
The good spatial and temporal resolution is the basis for different methods which provide information about the severity of such defects.	1.0535543036899206
Dynamic colour visualisation and volumetric measurements of regurgitant jets are a new evaluating tool for the assessment of heart valve insufficiencies.	0.8268479550510847
In Germany, as in all industrial nations, there has been an increase in the number of cases of cancer and in cancer-related mortality.	1.2568420459246155
According to the German Federal Bureau of Statistics, in 1998 nearly 213,000 persons died due to malignant cancer.	1.033200664318223
Cancer patients generally have physical and psychological dysfunction that may in turn cause a significant reduction in quality of life if treatment is performed insufficiently or not at all.	0.9731674244812035
Pain is the dominant symptom and can have serious effects on the patient and his or her family.	1.1791194708046198
Although various organizations have published treatment plans for adequate pain therapy, in many cases they are not adequately applied by physicians.	1.092822644151918
This work therefore offers a comprehensive review of pain therapy as an essential component of palliative medicine.	1.0347897705115146
This retrospective study shows the results in 30 patients of revision surgery on their reruptured ACL.	1.2467318173053417
The follow-up time was 30 months on average (range 10 - 54 months).	1.0887850345641357
The follow-up examination included subjective (Lysholm score, Tegner activity level rating score), clinical and radiological criteria and also instrumental laxity testing with the KT-1000 arthrometer.	1.1251805552079037
The overall evaluation was done according to the IKDC score.	0.7398270628109592
The follow up showed subjective and objective results almost equal to those after primary surgery on ACL.	1.0653045002073966
The IKDC score revealed certain abnormal and highly abnormal results, which demonstrated that revision ACL surgery gives poorer results than primary surgery.	0.9309401680333211
Nevertheless, we recommend reconstruction of a torn ACL even in a revision case to restore the knee function and prevent further menisceal and chondral damage and degeneration.	1.2717713876062975
Nowadays, restorative proctocolectomy is considered the "gold standard" in the surgical therapy of ulcerative colitis.	1.1101027163807222
Alternative procedures such as Brooke ileostomy or Kock pouch are limited to special indications.	0.6877569927204159
Preservation of function is the decisive advantage of the ileoanal pouch, but preservation of function is not equal to quality of life.	1.0669346552529297
Quality of life is a multidimensional concept that is difficult to define and measure.	0.887333001776894
Quality of life can only be assessed by standardized and validated quality-of-life questionnaires.	1.0493567560471968
Preoperatively, patients with ulcerative colitis have a restricted quality of life, depending on the intensity of their disease.	0.9088979958641658
Proctocolectomy is the curative therapy and improves quality of life.	0.8251226975943579
When evaluating quality of life it is not essential if patients are treated by Brooke ileostomy or restorative proctocolectomy.	1.076531640666647
The advantage of restorative proctocolectomy is the improvement in some aspects such as sexuality and physical acticity.	1.0000346643893345
The "Total Quality-of-Life Index" is not impoved.	1.1209691737288128
Preoperatively, patients should be informed that preservation of function by restorative proctocolectomy is accompanied by an increased postoperative morbidity in comparison to other procedures.	1.070857557298088
Decreased quality-of-life results when complications occur postoperatively that cannot be controlled over a long period of time.	0.8494155922692727
In some cases excision of the ileoanal pouch may be the most sensible way of solving the problems.	1.0401168000603953
On the other hand, patients without complications and good function after ileoanal pouch procedure may achieve a quality of life comparable to that of healthy controls.	1.1026873617033732
Preoperatively, patients should be aware of this risk-benefit relationship and should share the responsibility of the decision for or against restorative proctocolectomy.	1.0368296695531374
The objective of this investigation was the experimental determination of the contact pressures in the hip joint for characteristic phases of the gait cycle.	1.064707978434941
The joint forces determined in vivo with telemetric endoprosthesis by Bergmann et al.	0.773549048928485
(1993) were converted into a pelvic reference system, based on kinematic gait analysis.	0.94930506722573
In eight cadaveric hip joints (age 18-75 yrs.)	0.9362585533179881
the reaction forces were applied corresponding to four phases of the gait cycle (heel strike, mid-stance, heel off, toe off) and the pressure distribution determined with FUJI pressure sensitive film.	1.0312470444473072
We found maxima of 10 MPa during mid stance.	0.6728862447405894
The areas of highest pressure were located in the ventro-superior aspect of the acetabulum (anterior part of the acetabular roof) and in the dorso-inferior aspect of the lunate surface.	1.1582463513893209
The pressure distribution was relatively constant during the four phases and the maxima did not vary proportional to the applied load.	0.9342315533385062
The normal pressure distribution in the hip appears to be determined by the physiological incongruity of the articular surfaces and the inhomogeneous bony support of the acetabulum.	1.1486329507830422
During operative interventions this normal load transfer should be restored as accurately as possible.	0.6758741909243317
In spite of its serious sequelae, volatile substance abuse (VSA) attracts very little public attention in Germany.	0.8902008774493511
Our case report describes an adult male who inhaled propane for recreational purposes.	0.8780846718533148
Initially, he achieved short-lived euphoria and hallucinations.	0.8855982433800289
He compensated for the developing tolerance by increasing the dosage, finally consuming 5 litres of fluid propane daily.	0.8855810484662698
Getting such quantities was facilitated by his occupational access to propane.	0.6900983338783856
Since he abused the propane in an apartment house, he also exposed third parties to the danger of explosion.	0.8709053593653843
Clinical examination revealed disturbances in orientation, restricted perceptivity and concentration, reduced mnemonic performance, and psychomotor agitation.	0.9996992911399872
All these symptoms diminished during a 6-month follow-up.	0.7929395375616314
The relationship of his organic mental disorder to the abuse of propane was not clear, since he had also abused alcohol.	1.0522564216409336
Objectives The Marburg external patellotibial (Mpt) fixator is designed to temporarily protect a reconstructed distal extensor apparatus of the knee.	0.8312761391084392

The indications or ultrasound in the evaluation of pulmonary disorders are described.	0.8894688431832412
Clinical applications are several lung diseases in adults and especially in children.	0.9264260858532813
In specific, well-defined applications, the feasibilties of ultrasound are promising.	1.0597790602497115
Sonography provides important additional information to chest X-ray and is even superior to CT under special circumstances.	1.0354401890318108
Pulmonary sonography is a useful link between conventional X-ray and more expensive cross-sectional imaging.	1.2130379400631464
In the evaluation of pulmonary diseases at present the potential of ultrasound is not optimally used.	1.093686114081198
Traditionally oral surgeons and dentists have evaluated the jaws using intraoral films and panoramic radiographs.	0.778767090850071
The involvement of radiologists has been limited.	0.5965329461018007
In the past few years dedicated CT-software-programs developed to evaluate dental implant patients have provided a new look at the jaws.	0.9673647253294791
The complex anatomy is described and identified on human skulls and on axial, panoramic, and cross-sectional images.	0.9915849455775051

Suggestions to reduce these doses by simple modifications of the recommended procols are given.	0.8796996416906827
The debate on passive and active euthanasia has met a controversial echo both in the German-speaking media and in professional publications within recent years.	0.9171850408258471
This discussion, however, largely excluded mentally ill  patients.	1.021779796735201
Also, euthanasia advocacy groups have usually distanced themselves from  euthanasia in psychiatric patients.	0.8999902345501006
We report here two cases from our hospital in which in-patients with affective disorders committed assisted suicide during a hospital pass.	1.0910280000252397
We discuss these events under the assumption that these are cases of questionable active euthanasia in mentally ill patients whose judgement was considerably compromised by their disorder.	0.942578109618518
Definition of the problem: In Germany, the dissection rate of the deceased is distinctly lower than in many other European countries.	1.16252526666269
Although critics of autopsies use to put forward ethical objections and religious scruples, neither the Christian church nor piety stand opposite to the practise of autopsies.	0.7963593779201548
Currently undergoing a clinical trial a new miniaturized monoplane ultrasound probe potentially enhances the practicability of perioperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) without loss of echocardiographic quality.	0.8780263325746802
Methods: In the present prospective study, the nasally inserted miniaturized TEE probe was tested in 12 ventilated patients and compared with a conventional TEE probe.	1.3598591788478072
Echocardiographic quality was tested by two independent investigators by analyzing the percentage of the endocardium contour detection (<50%, 50-75%, 75-100%) in the left ventricular short- and long-axis views.	1.4137338852934886
Results: In 11 patients, more than 50% of endocardium were visualized continuously with both probes.	1.1435355471801307
Although the nasal TEE probe was inferior to conventional TEE in detecting lateral endocardium, automated endocardium detection compared well with both methods.	0.8887093680573581
Inter- and intraobserver variability in manual measurements of the left ventricular cross-sectional area was below 5% on average and differed non-significantly with regard to the method.	1.2484221792412071
In 2 patients, continuous monitoring was aggravated by repeated loss of contact between the miniaturized TEE probe and mucosa.	0.792928827072695
Conclusions: In comparison with conventional TEE, the miniaturized TEE probe provides practicability advantages without significant loss of information for cardiovascular monitoring.	1.2696123992442923
By means of modern color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) even very small vessels can be visualized.	0.8068939385505144
Maximum resolution nowadays is about 0.5 mm diameter of the vessel.	1.1633773782617074
We compared the use of CCDS and angiography in studying of acral perfusion.	0.9351233120895662
Besides morphologic criteria, hemodynamic criteria were recorded.	0.6574700505578744
Arteries in healthy fingers appear as long and straight vessels with a clearly defined border.	0.8316017666628953
The physiological maximal blood flow velocity exceded 20 cm/s.	0.6726702941447195
CCDS revealed tortuosity of finger arteries as typical finding in thrombangiitis obliterans.	0.7294720817277957
Segmental stenosis can either be identified morphologically or quantified by measurement of the flow velocity with poststenotic maximal systolic velocities of less than 20 cm/s or by the acceleration of the blood flow within the stenosis, as proven by angiographic examinations.	1.015060040871545
CCDS is suitable for evaluation of acral perfusion in patients suffering from secondary Raynaud's syndrome.	0.7364357895315417
Apart from diagnosis of disturbed acral circulation, other possible applications of CCDS are in in the surgical field, for example replantations in hand or finger surgery.	1.064544805347213
The discussion of the Osheroff vs Chestnut Lodge court case in the "American Journal of Psychiatry" raised the question whether individual psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is the appropriate treatment for severe depression.	0.9638811829635023
A summary of the crucial points and a review of the clinical and scientific implications of this case is presented.	1.1840030813751592
In addition, the difference between psychiatrists and psychotherapists regarding the assessment of depressive disorders is examined by analysing results of the ICD-10 research criteria study.	1.0518017186222457
In the case of one patient with dysthymia (ICD-10 RC: F34.1) psychotherapists tended more towards a reactive or neurotic etiology than psychiatrists.	1.0135416935746204
By contrast, the percentage of clinicians suspecting an endogenous etiology and thus, diagnosing a psychosis and starting a psychopharmacotherapy was markedly higher among psychiatrists.	0.9970930927919048
In conclusion, the integration of different conceptualizations and treatment modalities is emphasized as an essential task for both psychotherapists and psychiatrists.	1.0462530538882577
For certain patients, an integrated therapy may be more effective.	1.1141163026921548
A 43-year-old patient was admitted for severe claudicatio in his right leg, doppler ultrasound and angiography revealed an occluded right common iliac artery.	1.030802421178308
Using the cross-over-approach from the contralateral side, it was possible to navigate a guide wire through the occlusion, and after passage with an excimer laser an ipsilateral retrograde puncture with placement of a sheath was performed.	1.0852307457990622
In order to protect the the aortoiliac bifurcation, a primary stent implantation of the occluded side was carried out using the kissing balloon technique.	1.076626849375514
Afterwards three stents were placed.	0.5253222437524312
Subsequently the patient completely improved; treadmill exercise test and duplex sonography showed good results.	0.7774339582125258
Conclusion: Using the kissing balloon technique, laser-assisted recanalisation of iliac artery occlusions even involving the aortoiliac bifurcation compare favorable to other more invasive treatments.	1.0671566416570086
A surgical procedure can thus be avoided.	0.8876463042201219
The typical MRI features of the most common pancreatic diseases, such as pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, have been established.	1.224034150932843
However, even in these common pancreatic disorders, MRI correlation with the underlying pathology is limited for clinical reasons.	1.3047976704717563
We emphasize MR-pathological correlation of inflammatory and neoplastic pancreatic changes, including pancreatitis, adenocarcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, rare cystic and solid pancreatic neoplasms, and islet cell tumors.	1.0660438889168304
By highlighting the correlation of key pathological features with MR findings, a better understanding of the MR appearance of pancreatic pathology can be provided.	1.0149976379053878
In addition, MRI may prove a powerful tool in detection and characterization of pancreatic tumors.	1.0967448842362237
Background: The implantation of a femoro-popliteal bypass graft represents the gold standard in the management of arteriosclerotic occlusive disease in the femoro-popliteal region.	0.9629162781351293
Application of interventional techniques has permitted the development of a novel, endovascular implantable bypass system.	0.9273908147041049
The device is placed within the lumen of the superficial femoral artery.	0.6977076347706641
The present study investigated the technical properties of the new system in cadavers, with subsequent evaluation of its application in humans.	1.28304249802672
Methods: The endopass consists of a thin-wall polycarbourethane tube with a total length of 53 cm.	1.1222275489010791
The distal end is connected with a self-expanding stent prothesis 4 cm in length.	0.8310082647376262
Endovascular implantation is performed through a groin incision.	0.7199580381697892
Following antegrade ringstripper-TEA, the endopass is introduced into the femoral artery after placement of a guide wire.	1.026708667667754
The proximal anastomosis is performed surgically.	0.624127392728799
Results: The technical requirements and feasibility of the system were tested on 12 cadaver extremities.	1.2241308927298111
Implantation of the device proved technically successful in seven of eight extremities with significant occlusion of the superficial femoral artery.	0.9257661476662543
The most important problems included the complete ringstripper-TEA, the placement of the guide wire following the TEA, and the expansion of the endopass.	1.1391568351818495
Following approval by the ethics commission, the endopass was implanted in five patients between June 1997 and March 1998.	1.0571362010861494
In three patients, the endopass remained patent and has functioned well.	1.1074354574397216
One patient with poor vascular outflow suffered an early noncorrectable occlusion, while in the remaining case, perforation secondary to the ringstripper procedure forced us to abandon the attempt.	1.0847816047888308
Conclusion: Experience from the cadaver study and initial human applications confirm the feasibility of this method.	1.1524720897506395
Further development and methodological improvement, however, are necessary requiring additional, larger studies on patients.	1.0938886026570895
Introduction: There is no data available on the action of etomidate on ion currents in human neuronal cells.	1.2212247660475786
Therefore the effects of etomidate on a human neuronal delayed rectifer potassium current were investigated.	0.7832233877479445
In order to evaluate patients' exposure to radiation in computed tomography, dose quantities such as the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), multiple scan average dose (MSAD) and dose free in air on the axis of rotation are used.	1.0832415043302228
The CTDI and the MSAD, derivable from the CTDI, are a good measure for the absorbed doses in the examined volume, but they do not take the biological sensitivity of the organs into account and do not describe the radiogenic risk that is actually relevant for patients and doctors.	1.0525315327417861
The dose on the axis of rotation is not an accurate measure of the effective dose and the radiogenic risk.	0.9779887437280097
The declaration of a limit for the dose on the axis of rotation should take the different regions into account, in order to guarantee acceptable image quality on one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other side.	1.1515529706979188
As physical dose quantities, the CTDI, MSAD and dose on the axis of rotation are useful to characterize and differentiate between programs and systems concerning radiation exposure.	0.918196629886507
Prognosis of patients surviving acute myocardial infarction has substantially improved over the last two decades.	1.0938743295351898
However, stratification of patients at risk for death due to arrhythmic events remains a clinical challenge.	1.1949632582706584
Due to the important role of the autonomic nervous system in the genesis of sudden death, autonomic markers such as heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity have recently gained attention as risk stratification parameters.	1.0292514299449795
The present study reports the results of noninvasive risk stratification in 411 consecutive postinfarction patients treated due to contemporary therapeutical guidelines with a high proportion of patients discharged with a patent infarct related artery.	1.093925189990543
The diagnostic arsenal of risk parameters comprised heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and more traditional markers such as non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ventricular late potentials.	0.9577741690221554
Patiens were followed for a mean of 33  +/- 21 months.	1.0524802798869248
Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that left ventricular function, both autonomic markers, and the patency of the infarct related artery were independent predictors of the prospectively defined primary study endpoint, i.e., all-cause mortality plus ventricular tachyarrhythmic events.	1.0728421782900937
With respect to the secondary endpoint (ventricular tachyarrhythmic events), left ventricular function, heart rate variability, and infarct vessel patency were independent predictors.	1.1833770762290905
Ventricular late potentials and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia had no predictive value with respect to ventricular tachyarrhythmic events.	0.8496083979580406
These findings from a large prospective long-term study demonstrate the value of markers of cardiac autonomic tone in identifying infarct survivors at risk for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death.	0.9326417010612839
K+ Channels and Cardiotoxicity of Drugs: Implications for Drug Toxicity Assessment - The time required for repolarization of the ventricles can be measured as the QT interval of the ECG and is determined primarily by activation of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK), which consists of a rapid component (IKr) and a slow component (IKs).	1.190349002540552
Drugs that block cardiac IKr prolong the cardiac action potential (AP).	0.6405895512853066
Prolonged repolarization is detected as a longer QT interval on the ECG.	0.7849549356017309
During prolonged APs, increased inward currents induce early afterdepolarizations, which increase the risk of Torsades de pointes (TdP) cardiac arrhythmias.	0.9798675210199166
TdP arrhythmia is characterized by an apparent twisting of the electrical axis around the isoelectric line.	0.8469048734881249
It has a rate of 150 to 250 beats/min and it can occasionally degenerate into ventricular fibrillation that may be fatal.	0.9822098788409633
The incidence of drug-induced TdP arrhythmias is highest among class IA and class III antiarrhythmic agents.	0.8815124149900126
However, under certain clinical conditions, also several non-cardiovascular medicinal products induce QT interval prolongations in the ECG or TdP arrhythmias.	1.1367389836155324
Since all drugs known to cause TdP block IKr, an early evaluation of possible effects on APs of cardiac myocytes expressing IKr channels during the developmental phases of novel drugs seems to be recommended.	1.0596254447324998
If in-vitro electrophysiological studies show the new active substance to induce AP prolongation and/or K+ channel blockade in appropriate models and at relevant concentrations,  either further development of the new active substance may not be justified or the risk factors predisposing to TdP arrhythmias should be taken into account in further clinical studies.	1.1043288866041723
Carcinoma of the penis is a malignant epithelial tumor of ominous prognosis if not adequately treated.	0.9829561570777554
To a large extent the probability of positive lymph nodes is determined by the grade of the primary lesion.	1.0911993236527011
In turn the number of positive nodes greatly influences the survival.	0.8067416413820571
In the past the complications of radical ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy have decreased their timely indication.	0.9363294609766053
If delayed lymphadenectomy is performed, the survival rate is reduced by approximately 50 % as compared to the results of immediate lymphadenectomy.	1.1698103711766632
The modified inguinal lymphadenectomy described by Catalona leads to less complications.	0.689214725036417
If performed without delay it should lead to improved survival in patients with higher stage and high grade penile cancer.	1.011191068575764
Recently suggested employment of adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherpy may further enhance the survival.	0.7137857874653932
On the basis of existing models for psychodynamic diagnostic evaluation and psychoanalytic interview technique and of the theoretical concepts of the 5 axes of the OPD diagnosis, a new type of the psychodynamic assessment interview is presented.	1.1074885025585244
The examination is structured in 5 phases: the opening scene, exploration of specific examples for relationships, exploration of experience of self and others, of therapy motivation, and finally clarifying the preconditions for treatment and the ability for insight.	1.1650540764373465
The syndrome diagnosis according to ICD 10 is completed in a final phase.	0.8667806218871686
This psychodynamic-diagnostic assessment interview is recommended, apart from the use for OPD diagnosis, for use a clinical instrument.	1.0423746276487473
Cryptococcal meningitis is one of the most frequent forms of meningoencephalitis in AIDS patients.	0.8960225688467801
Before the introduction of triazol antibiotics like difluconazole, the frequency of this meningitis among AIDS patients was 5-10%, yet declined during the last years.	1.1624396422933325
Clinically, nonspecific signs of a meningeal inflammation predominate while focal neurological signs are rare.	0.9270509310385311
Rapid institution of high-dose antimycotic therapy is the keystone to improve prognosis and decrease mortality.	1.0742265658864794
Antimycotics of choice are amphotericin B, fluconazole, and flucytosin.	0.978866772456225
Diagnosis is established by detection of cryptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid, microscopic demonstration of cryptococci using India-ink, and cryptococcal cultures.	0.8579443854930465
Recent developments aim to improve antimycotic therapies.	0.7006172189980053
During the last years, life-long secondary prevention with difluconazole was established.	0.9066548222918805
Cryptococci which are resistent against fluconazole and amphotericin B are a special challenge, yet fortunately are rare.	0.8788938187822504
Longterm outcome of patients is determined by the progression of the underlying immunsuppression.	1.162159349308837
Therefore, combination of secondary prophylaxis with modern antiviral substances is important.	1.10332080239378
Clinical decision analysis in patients with suspected cryptococcal meningitis is presented using methods from evidence-based medicine.	1.0254019297696677
The effect of aprotinin (2000000 IU as a bolus +500000 JU/h until the end of the operation) on transfusion requirements and coagulation parameters in orthotopic liver transplantation (study group: n=9; placebo group: n=9) was investigated in a randomised, double-blind study.	1.0150988962993581
Coagulation parameters were monitored intraoperatively using a mobile laboratory.	0.8064032609690184
In contrast to the published results, no effect on transfusion requirements could be demonstrated.	1.146672149933632
