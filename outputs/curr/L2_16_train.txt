We need that because the various European Union bodies and all the Member States within monetary union have to be able to depend on one another.	0.7231269349588049
It is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons.	0.6859775285679007
Firstly, for the single market.	1.0530499806444875
It is most important quite generally in a single market to have reliable and directly comparable data and statistics so as to give an accurate picture of the situation and development trends.	0.8173176561629463
Secondly, for economic and monetary union.	0.9771876201886518
The regulation dating from 1993 on the application of the Protocol must be brought into harmony with the methodology of the European system of accounts at national and regional level.	0.7109330382539454
That is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits.	0.4949006035895496
This adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the Member States more precisely.	0.4531904495006555
These technical changes will have a very real impact on the actual position of the countries, since the data will automatically be amended in line with the public deficit.	1.013385633756118
I also welcome the fact that the estimates of the deficits for the 1999 financial year that are due to be published in March 2000 are already based on the new ESA, i.e. the analysis is based on consolidated aggregates that are economically relevant.	0.7325514672724472
Let me also briefly use this debate as an opportunity to urge all the governments and political parties to do their utmost to ensure that this procedure never has to be initiated for an excessive deficit.	0.7274561912854782
It is good that the procedure exists.	0.5755718703836241
We need it because it lends our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility.	0.38991595102845283
The citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met.	0.498883604888178
Thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously.	0.7231704484308124
Another important point is that we must do all we can, not just to prevent excessive deficits, but also to further reduce public deficits.	1.085162203551362
I know what I am talking about and I will conclude by telling you why I am so glad we are holding this debate!	0.7490623773996086
We are currently holding a debate in my own country on whether the former minister for finance actually gave us accurate information on the deficit.	0.7450522426784001
In my country, Austria, new elections had to be held in 1995 in order to meet the Maastricht criteria and persuade our political partner to rethink his approach.	0.6946408149795339
I must also tell you that in the year 2000, when there is so much talk about us, the coalition talks with the SPÖ failed - and unfortunately so - because the Socialist Party brought down the negotiated austerity and consolidation programme.	0.9633601087864068
That is a prime reason why the new government had to be formed in Austria; for the Austrian People' s Party, the ÖVP, wants to continue to act as guarantor of economic stability. The ÖVP wants to ensure that we continue to meet the Maastricht criteria and reduce the public deficit, as we have agreed here.	0.9896912241358107
Mr President, the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable.	0.8828721054811796
This is of great importance, especially in the light of European unification and the completion of the internal market.	0.7098482857881843
This is why this report is also so politically charged: a report, by the way, on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly.	1.2199380867792153
It also inspires a few political comments.	0.3653842786518591
The Stability Pact is a given in Europe.	0.5545540385384401
All countries participating in the euro have committed themselves, in the medium term, to striving towards a budget which is either balanced or shows up a slight surplus.	0.6914373771379012
This, of course, does not mean that, if the economic climate is less than favourable, the budget could not fluctuate up or down slightly. It means that, in the long and medium term, there should be a balance or surplus.	0.9832635482862814
The stronger the position of the participating countries, the stronger the euro will be.	0.6621809152563358
As a result, the three percent standard will rarely be exceeded, not even in a bad economic climate.	0.8144284858209684
This is the theory behind it, anyway.	0.6612476064095126
We have always been of the opinion that these criteria should be stringently met.	0.7632639835869525
That is of great importance in order to turn the EMU into a success, now and in the future.	0.8445084001216618
Strict compliance with the Stability Pact can thus contribute to a culture of stability within all EMU Member States.	0.595584269505778
Various Member States have taken one-off measures to be able to meet the criteria.	0.7682397069148083
We are of the opinion that the Member States' budget policy should be strictly supervised, to ensure that the measures continue to be taken in the spirit of the prescribed criteria at all times.	0.9192559842974728
A drop in standards should not be allowed.	0.5557823980777993
We are also of the opinion that a further reduction in the burden and reducing the national debt should be prioritised.	0.8080375016971534
Indeed, we still have not managed to stop passing on the burden to future generations.	0.7690362310695568
. (ES) Mr President, many thanks, first of all, to the rapporteur for his splendid work.	0.8602270840043756
It was a subject which called for a large dose of technical skill and I think Mr Knörr has handled it with great precision and professionalism.	0.7178440403275365
I would not presume to be able to summarise the content of our proposal better than he has done; I would just like to add one small point: in addition to adaptation to ESA 95, there are two small technical changes which Mr Knörr knows all about, relating to interest and the valuation of debt in foreign currency.	0.7295231187770616
I just mention that to complete the view of the process.	0.6763538962162344
Secondly, I would like to thank Mr Knörr for his speediness.	0.7950475591059495
He has done really good work in a very short time.	0.8228652316960919
This is an important subject for certain references which we have heard subsequently.	0.9724154827305342
What we are seeking with this legislation is not to make the statistics reliable and comparable - they already are - but to make them more reliable and more comparable.	1.0400333907916428
Obviously, the fact that Parliament has taken its decision so quickly will mean that the March figures can already be calculated on the basis of these new criteria.	0.7349068480051215
That being so, I believe the final result will be better.	1.0208445366647108
The figures will be more reliable and more comparable and I think the concerns some Members have raised about compliance with the stability pact can be better addressed.	0.7857355210775903
This regulation is purely instrumental.	0.4189535128869122
It does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised.	0.7572427782295181
But we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem.	0.779442968791719
The stability pact is in place and we will continue to press ahead with monitoring compliance by the various Member States, despite the fact that the results are clearly positive in all the Member States where we have analysed the position as regards the stability of the government deficit.	0.8597533232815835
But we see no reason to lower our guard.	0.4252102439865051
We must press on in that direction because we know it is vital.	0.8257716300270727
So, once again - and finally - I want to thank you for your help in allowing us to measure stability with greater technical certainty and better comparability.	0.8190967443190873
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	0.5686715436479425
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	0.21763534501096538
Increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting of the euro	0.29205043983905316
The next item is the report (A5-0020/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on a draft Framework Decision of the Council on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro (5116/1999 - C5-0332/1999 - 1999/0821(CNS)).	0.5748506306079036
.	-0.0
(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen (all the more welcome for being so few in number), one might have thought that it was an unimportant subject which was to be discussed at this hour, but that is not the case.	0.895322407097634
It is a definite and concrete issue. It is about our common currency.	0.9977930009479661
How many people here know that this currency is being counterfeited and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affairs?	0.9290826976747651
We cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited.	0.42031080726597486
The ECB, ECOFIN, Europol, OLAF and the Commissioner responsible for legal questions have therefore realised that common countermeasures must be taken quickly in order to close the loopholes left by the legislation.	0.6167122858591338
It is easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currencies for twenty years after the new currency has been introduced.	0.6337354505636521
It is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions.	0.8709698832885243
This is something which Parliament has said it wants to see added.	0.7698843664507448
The Council ought to have given Parliament the stipulated three-month period within which to consider, too, the last document produced on this matter, but we are all aware of how urgent it is to have these measures put safely in place.	0.8842505295149088
Because the issue is to be decided upon in March in the Council, Parliament has cause to adopt a position on the proposal now, so that the Member States have time also to take due account of Parliament' s points of view in the decision which has to be made in March.	1.0806028325827322
Any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency, and that country would be accountable, both morally and economically, if its actions were to contribute to a delay.	0.8278362008756133
A country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself.	0.6259571934356662
On 1 January 2002 the euro will be in circulation.	0.6905044577400883
The whole of the Union must have the same protection, a type of protection which prohibits counterfeiting, not only of currencies in circulation but also of currencies which will be in circulation.	1.0789352324582713
It is important that, in time, there should be a more or less similar-looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries.	0.9555496886997131
The Commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information, together with penal sanctions, preventive measures and the pooling of experience.	0.6651964771449522
These measures do, in fact, entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years' imprisonment.	0.6208632242119035
Trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences.	0.359409234754998
Quite simply, we are to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty.	1.0262060776427555
The denominations of the euro are well known.	0.587648796498653
Modern computer equipment can be used to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves.	0.701377331540405
Parliament has tabled a number of amendments to the present proposal, for example in regard to jurisdiction, the idea being that a person may only be prosecuted and sentenced in the one country for the same crime.	0.9390702644643428
There are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting, this being a measure which we would encourage.	0.8969310134220498
The new applicant States are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations.	0.5651790474079482
It has taken two years for the Council and the Commission to produce this proposal.	0.9710070444209329
It is essential that the decision should now be taken in March.	0.9299747573023573
To delay, or perhaps even risk damage to the euro, would be indefensible.	0.801425525516202
It would also be a betrayal of the people who will be handling the new, unfamiliar notes.	0.7875944916902756
In particular, it is believed that counterfeiters will turn their attention to countries outside the euro zone, where people are less familiar with the new currency.	0.6923621229609735
The protective measures cover these countries too, and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight.	0.709569138227215
The present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character, accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others.	0.5591424451958641
The Council must now convene in March and make the relevant decision.	0.6577815692543848
Thank you for listening.	0.6168728697700663
Thank you, too, those who contributed to this matter' s being dealt with swiftly. I am thinking in particular of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.	0.798202790987511
Mr President, first I want to compliment the rapporteur, Charlotte Cederschiöld, on drawing up this report, which is an excellent point of departure for increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro.	0.7906431049932393
The euro will enter into circulation on 1 January 2002 and will become one of the world' s most important reserve currencies.	0.6837154172975
Due to its importance on a world scale, the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery.	0.7776107175623149
This draft decision therefore lays down a set of minimum standards intended to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each Member State simpler and more effective.	0.6798148321012608
It also provides for the euro to be protected even prior to its circulation, which will fill a gap in legislation in some Member States.	0.7929356798230733
I expressly support the rapporteur as regards the need to extend this protection to national currencies which can continue to be exchanged after they have been withdrawn from circulation.	0.674942098429982
This means that every Member State must guarantee the establishment of effective, adequate penal sanctions, which act as a deterrent against the offences covered by the draft framework decision.	0.7485965471449945
As to the proposal to establish a maximum custodial sentence of not less than eight years, I do not think that this will raise any problems as far as my country is concerned, even though the maximum sentence for counterfeiting under its criminal code is currently five years in prison, as it has already expressed willingness to make this amendment.	0.9527994047695482
I also call on those few Member States still harbouring reservations to resolve them so that a decision can rapidly be reached on this matter, for the reasons our rapporteur set out earlier when she called for this to be done.	0.7499308418133974
Mr President, this draft framework decision represents the first time a common proposal on crime has been put forward, with legislation to be applied by all fifteen Member States at the same time.	0.9375294859779535
We are therefore making progress towards the aim of developing and confirming the status of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, as expressed at Tampere.	0.8206635421866652
Mr President, I need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points Mr Coelho made. All that is indeed very true and correct.	0.8498492661455782
It is easy to counterfeit the euro.	0.2925346665344399
We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history.	0.6516959069955385
It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already. Yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such, counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence.	0.8610874473922754
It is a highly complex problem.	0.8344424968238744
If we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschiöld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation.	0.6333117960855781
Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people.	0.5875563728202233
So what is the European Union doing about it?	0.8356309879003989
It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschiöld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschiöld, but more at the procedures that are being applied.	0.9405368230759779
The manner in which the Council, which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy.	0.7741035370250621
We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment.	0.9463971954791264
Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months.	0.8593006851965113
It is only thanks to the immense efforts of Mrs Cederschiöld and to Parliament' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages, that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the Council, so that the decision scheduled for March can indeed be taken.	0.9085577836543663
On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us.	0.563076854630455
So let me state quite clearly here, on behalf of my group, that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschiöld whether it is reasonable to work like this.	0.7330496764345965
We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure.	0.9386988120537348
This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress.	0.4822109377237268
Only, as Mrs Cederschiöld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited.	0.8970760496429054
One reason they have not been dealt with is that as ever the leopard cannot change its spots, i.e. in the case of this framework decision, which specifically relates to judicial cooperation, the Council once again prefers to adhere to the level of government cooperation.	0.8072550354752901
That is why, and I quote, this framework decision "is confined to supplementing the provisions of the International Convention of 20 April 1929 for the suppression of counterfeiting and its Protocol" , i.e. the provisions of a timeworn international convention that is a good 71 years old.	0.8821203006961549
That means that the legal basis we are now seeking to establish to protect the euro does not derive from Community legislation, as it should, but merely takes the form of provisions supplementing an international convention dating back 71 years.	0.9209207965432155
I leave it to the assembled company in this Chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a European Union based on judicial cooperation.	0.9670748510744466
Thank you for your attention during our night sitting together.	0.5448280060259835
Mr President, the launch of the euro could well be a heaven-sent opportunity for counterfeiters.	0.7475885755532649
The fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references, and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article.	0.8133647481734883
So the Council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions, primarily criminal, applicable in all the countries of Europe, against offences of this kind.	0.8374508561026832
No doubt the Council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that Member States adopt national legislation to that effect.	0.6400281704328382
That is what I would have preferred, personally.	1.1694074020561969
But, probably through lack of confidence in the zeal of certain members, the Council has preferred to implement a legal instrument which is more binding at European level: a framework decision.	0.9289448634253921
Now that is where the difficulties begin, because criminal law comes under national sovereignty and the Treaty of Maastricht contains no specific provision covering this situation for the euro - so as not to frighten the voters by over-egging the pudding.	0.7468201834478646
The draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this lacuna by referring to Articles 31 and 34(2)(b) of the Treaty.	0.5344700726759387
However, I find these passports inadequate.	0.9004826856179283
Article 31 only envisages minimum common rules for criminal acts in certain cases, specifically restricted to organised crime, terrorism and drug trafficking.	0.5529620077319196
Counterfeiting is not on the list.	0.34050336580065554
Article 34, a product of the Treaty of Amsterdam, only lays down the new form of a framework decision, and clearly this only applies to the existing powers of the European Union.	0.9451955414996329
So we come back to the previous problem.	0.708088965023564
In other words, the Council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis.	0.7761933464148763
In a way, this is deferred punishment for its lack of honesty, at the time, in presenting the Maastricht Treaty to the voters.	0.8817826752284693
I would also like to make a more general point.	0.8295071968297449
Not so long ago we were dealing with one or more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part-session.	0.7125331654405708
But there has been nothing for a year.	0.5572033779169815
Just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting.	0.48183958618164163
The Commission' s communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, which we have debated this week, contained absolutely nothing on this vast subject, except the reminder, in a single line, that the euro coins and notes are due to come into circulation on 1 January 2002.	0.861204517622858
However, there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved.	0.8766183867253884
Let us mention, for example, the disturbing lack of public interest, the definition of monetary policy objectives abusively reduced to the mere fight against inflation, the strange coupling of monetary federalism to a lack budgetary or fiscal federalism, the status of the present applicant countries, when they become members, vis-à-vis the euro zone, the confused reaction of the international markets to this currency with no homogeneous popular foundation, and so on. Do I also need to mention that investors who sold dollars to buy euros have lost 20% since 1 January 1999, 40% if they bought bonds, and no less than 55% if they sold yen to buy euros?	0.8038080358077906
Mr President, for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money.	0.6733914422887645
These are gigantic problems but they seem to be taboo here.	0.44196631031989825
I should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker.	0.8944825009172462
There are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions, because the point of departure is, of course, that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern.	0.8585008590162078
Criminal law is part of each individual nation' s own cultural tradition, and it is very difficult to arrive at common definitions of what is to be understood by these basic legal concepts.	0.8951603353257054
I appreciate Mrs Cederschiöld' s work, and my point of departure will be her search - in connection with the Tampere Summit - for common definitions and common regulations regarding what is punishable and what common sanctions can be applied.	0.8364645396282914
She would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the EU.	0.5563056755161359
But the problem is that there is no legal basis for this, and with good reason, because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction.	1.0259892696926889
In that context, I want to ask the following question of the Commission' s and the Council' s representatives: is the legal basis which has been invoked adequate?	1.1133070440598618
In my view, it is clearly in conflict with, and far exceeds the scope of, Article 34, paragraph 2, point b where a legal basis is established for so-called framework decisions which are binding upon the Member States in regard to the desired objectives, but in which it is left to the national authorities to determine the form and methods of implementation.	0.9363723047942538
What of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the Member States' obligations are laid down in detail. There is no freedom of choice regarding methods and implementation.	0.8430428955457151
In my view, this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis.	0.7968055793746969
I should like an answer from the Commission and the Council, for I consider it obvious that Article 31 does not supply the relevant legal basis.	0.8759174547335165
Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that, in her report, she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes, which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now, to supplement and improve the text.	0.8303400892487555
It is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to spoil this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting - and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made.	0.8934338896296199
We have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it.	0.568067016263817
So, in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting, to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions, the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do.	1.04913302222319
We are also concerned with the question of cooperation.	0.8865561434760612
We need to define the precise responsibilities of the ECB, the national central banks, the Commission and Europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro.	0.9292309184351092
I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work.	0.6241947149939392
In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities.	0.8136519052384922
Aside from the report, which we welcome, many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved.	0.951767442788356
I hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification.	0.7199170381516962
Mr President, Mrs Cederschiöld, ladies and gentlemen, how safe is the euro?	0.6893915129841829
That is, after all, a question the people often ask.	0.7242446212270095
And that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 January 2002, the date when they will have euros in their pockets.	0.7523697761689193
For the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but, in fact, also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	0.9851865252204208
That too is a concern of the people, for, as has rightly been said, this will be a new currency for them, new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used.	1.0770166600784512
Of course all the citizens of the EU Member States will also be faced with the novelty of a currency that is valid over such a wider area, and even beyond Europe, as a reserve currency.	0.9704044333174615
They will need time to get used to that too.	0.4619720468003327
So it is clearly necessary to ask what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting.	0.8636458906633188
And that is what we are discussing at this late hour.	0.9820837595848407
This really is a subject that is close to the citizen, so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour.	0.9904495012278823
But that cannot be helped.	0.36825818879504024
Of course, the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time.	0.8342455606302697
After all, it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting.	0.6407853176160624
As has also been pointed out, in summer 1998 the Commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken, such as information, further training - an important area, cooperation between the euro-states and of course even beyond them, and measures under criminal law.	0.8797250386409984
That is what this framework decision is about.	0.841366639784299
Mrs Cederschiöld, let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the Commission and, above all, let me also thank Parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time.	0.7902667746556733
I certainly appreciate that.	0.30842155716235664
The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences.	0.6733665454568423
Of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and, as was emphasised, what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced.	0.9403013111865982
Naturally, the Commission is also glad that the European Parliament' s prompt decision - and I hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now, so that we can begin to transpose it.	1.0745611843485672
For the Commission has been asked to report, as it will in the first half of next year, on the progress in transposing it in the Member States, on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action.	1.1638281696092894
It has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law.	1.0203764319123527
In that respect we must recognise this innovation, this step, even if, as Mr Schulz just pointed out, simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step.	0.9619717171974946
In reply to the question whether the Commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the Treaty, the Commission believes that the right basis is being applied here.	0.9686547982606606
The framework decision will, however, have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future.	0.7844108479943153
The Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with Europol.	0.8397898832970458
That proposal will establish a duty to cooperate, and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify Europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, so that effective measures can then be taken.	0.8709584480121288
On the question of coordinating the various measures, since early 1998, the Commission, followed now by OLAF, has been working with experts on the subject from the Member States, the European Central Bank and Europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance.	0.9273581305539785
As Mr Karas just pointed out, a few weeks ago the Commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro, to which it proposed allocating as much as EUR 32 million.	0.9105465848251101
That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	0.8586857926225979
I believe that this debate shortly before midnight will also teach a salutary lesson to all those counterfeiters who believe their hour has come, because they think the EU is no longer awake at this late hour!	0.7823690939622844
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.	0.5694357387495655
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	0.21763534501096538
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)	0.34014449817963394
Resumption of the sitting	0.25731927925140996
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	0.3276264714268111
Are there any comments?	0.1201495129830156
(The Minutes were approved)	0.0864398819752701
Mr President, I should like make a comment in connection with a meeting held last night by various Members of Parliament from all groups.	0.7870197508225862
The purpose of the meeting, which was attended by several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, together with the architects who designed this building, was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions.	0.7112873497875161
We discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you, Mr President, in fact conceals a huge window which, if the curtain were drawn back, would afford a wonderful view over the river.	0.7709363153370916
We were told that the curtain was closed so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the lighting during debates.	0.769111200104558
But what is to prevent us, before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting, opening the curtains and enjoying the apparently magnificent view behind you?	0.6078849103838637
I am more than happy for our House to be illuminated by the brilliance of our debates but a little real sunlight on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss.	0.4718666986179491
I think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the ushers.	0.7027819307873527
Thank you very much Mr Onesta, I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort.	0.7648626347676327
I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being.	0.7698817517440868
In the meantime, I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter, technically speaking.	1.0281862612534505
If so, then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the President sits with his back to the light!	0.8093764131826714
UCITS	-0.0
.	-0.0
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my hope that Parliament is prepared now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in Europe.	0.6896455648535029
As a new Member of the European Parliament, it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter.	1.102522240815615
I should especially like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their willingness to find compromises; the President and the Bureau for lending a sensitive ear to this complex issue; the Commission, and especially the Commissioner, for being such worthwhile contacts; the Council; and also the division responsible for servicing the committee, for its selfless work.	0.9848621179630536
There was a good deal of agreement within the committee, apart from on a matter which, too, I hope it will be possible to solve.	0.8956956154856568
The issue of UCITS may appear difficult, technical and a political minefield.	0.5910374799843312
I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stands for.	0.699102343989394
Allow me, however, to state very clearly that this is a question which really does affect the citizens of Europe in so far as it relates to how their savings are administered, what options there are available, how competition operates between countries in regard to different forms of savings, savers' demand for security, and the opportunities Europe' s citizens have to save wisely for their old age.	0.8119278313711269
It is a question of weighing demands for liberalisation in the interests of a better market and higher yield against investors' need for protection and security.	0.5568190868957523
In the course of the 1980s, most markets in Europe underwent drastic deregulation. As a result, the national money and bond markets in particular developed very quickly over a period of a few years.	0.7898238340399745
Collective investment undertakings became an alternative to saving with a bank.	0.42902849878281485
In my own country, more than 60 per cent of Swedes save with a variety of funds.	0.576202640375924
The security afforded by this type of saving is attributable to the broad range of investment vehicles in which the funds are placed.	0.6098828787659826
The capital and securities market has continued to be developed.	0.5810676239365403
The current Directive on UCITS has become antiquated and outdated.	0.3971023626162866
New types of funds have been introduced in the various Member States which are not permitted to market their units in other Member States.	0.7626770936294871
Obviously, this inhibits competition and innovation and restricts the public' s range of savings options.	0.534821897410063
The Commission' s proposal with which we are dealing today is in two parts.	0.868100249192409
The first concerns the product, that is to say the funds.	0.8565319042601915
The other concerns the collective investment undertakings.	0.5126341953992944
The main purpose of the first proposal is to extend the investment opportunities of collective investment undertakings by allowing them to invest in units in other collective investment undertakings, for example units in funds, standardised options and futures contracts and deposits in credit institutions and in certain types of money market instruments.	0.688453116762334
Special risk-spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments, involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria.	0.5594770612529619
In addition, the Commission' s proposal puts forward special risk-spreading rules for funds whose aim is to replicate a particular stock index, a so-called index fund.	0.6646765089258362
The committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the Commission' s proposal more stringent.	0.8282133390327656
To guarantee transparency and prudence, investments in non-harmonised funds should only be allowed on condition that qualitative criteria, for example a transparency requirement and investor protection, are introduced.	0.6362533525014865
In addition, quantitative criteria (risk exposure) should be introduced.	0.5047440568544769
Moving on now, then, to the point where there is (or, I hope, was) a lack of agreement, namely OTC derivatives.	1.1064001924614717
The Commission' s proposal makes a distinction between derivatives dealt in on regulated markets and derivative instruments not dealt in on regulated markets (so-called OTC derivatives).	0.46404771350530855
The Commission' s proposal takes it as read that OTC derivatives are not one of the general types of investment that UCITS deal in, but that they should only be used to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange-rate risks.	0.8073882714961914
In recent years, the derivatives market has grown very rapidly in almost all the Member States.	0.571987721750218
It is therefore important that regulation of derivatives is flexible so that the market is not tied down ahead of future developments.	0.7628605248472831
The definitions 'standardised futures contracts' and 'standardised options' should therefore be combined to form a new definition, 'financial derivative instruments' , which also covers OTC derivatives.	0.6934023805790531
Investment in OTC derivatives, however, should only be allowed on condition that both quantitative and qualitative criteria are introduced.	0.5560401525518563
They are very important in this case.	1.0650182195259705
They must be introduced to guarantee the protection of investors.	0.7552777160544387
The Commission' s second proposal focuses on the bodies which manage UCITS, that is to say management companies.	0.6832132072651581
The rules for management companies, for example the conditions for starting up and conducting business, are brought into line with the existing rules and regulations.	0.859322812811627
A crucial point is that rules are proposed for so-called simplified prospectuses.	0.6137882914736252
Relevant information must be given to prospective unit-holders in a fund in a language which is readily understandable to investors in the host country.	0.47459776890256067
In this regard, too, the committee is prepared to go further than the Commission.	0.9469358265337937
A question which has also been discussed in the committee is that of the capital contribution to be required from management companies.	1.039146037889754
There are different views on this.	0.5146334701350403
One of the most important things, for me, personally, is that the common regulations should not cause smaller companies to go under.	0.9214238274047624
During the months that I have been working on this report, one very clear demand has emerged, both from industry and from those who represent the consumer.	0.861077408862869
The current situation is not good.	0.904612579771021
Both savers and the industry need modernised regulations for the whole of Europe.	0.5829073322705075
I believe that today' s proposal strikes a good balance between liberalisation of the market and the desire for effective protection for investors.	0.8737697561298681
I just want to conclude by saying that a number of Members of Parliament think that the present proposal goes too far, while others think that I am not sufficiently liberal.	0.9985309191414317
To them I just want to say, as the English expression goes, 'You can' t have it all.'	0.7206644656680553
.	-0.0
Mr President, at the outset I wish to place on the official record of the House my thanks for the tremendous work undertaken by Mr Schmidt, our rapporteur.	0.9026914198319445
I was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous Parliament.	0.8555027360712386
We failed over the last six years to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter.	0.6704637313218891
In a short space of time Mr Schmidt has managed to bring it forward to this final stage within Parliament. I thank him for that.	0.8215741429451907
As the draftsperson for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I also wish to place on record my thanks to the secretariat of both the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee for their cooperation on this matter.	0.7530498760296837
I am speaking today wearing a number of hats: firstly, as the surrogate father of this report; secondly, as the draftsperson of the opinion; and most importantly, as one who sees the tremendous advantages which can be gained for the European Union from a harmonised system of UCITS investment to ensure that monies presently being earned in Europe but invested outside the European Union and not put to the benefit of the Union economy can be retained within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship, employment and also for guaranteeing future pension rights.	0.8691025945206661
There is little disagreement amongst Members with regard to the first proposal.	0.7006045013472451
It puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities.	0.7884673178797056
However, it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern.	1.1112975184058798
I have a number of ideas which should be put across.	0.8567878198515629
Firstly, the idea of an EU passport for management companies is to be welcomed; and the home-state approval rule is also to be welcomed.	0.9416863561327923
However, instead of imposing a new regime, we could have used the Investment Services Directive as the analogy for this regime.	0.7528675563210834
It seems unusual that we failed to grasp that opportunity.	0.4245056837076185
Many Members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries' national interests rather than improving the overall system for Europe.	0.6451490439787041
We will have to revisit this issue again in the near future.	0.6059179847137819
I call on Members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put Europe on a sound footing for the short term, if not for the long term.	0.8649489381716514
Mr President, I must firstly thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, my colleague, Mr Goebbels, and Mrs Villiers and Mrs Lulling from my Group. Despite their differing opinions on some points, they have consistently worked in an extremely constructive manner.	0.9949511215703539
As indicated by the rapporteur, we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this Parliament.	1.1225021771540404
Collective investment undertakings have for some time been the primary savings vehicle through which millions of ordinary citizens, without any specialist knowledge, have invested their life savings.	0.6728943379109947
This is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation, albeit in a prudent manner.	0.7738624114820646
I say this because the failure of a bank is a problem for which any government can find a solution.	0.6982813307604763
However, the failure and suspension of payments of this type of undertaking would create a political, social and personal problem with incalculable consequences.	0.7106039731354333
There is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings.	0.8249164872269775
I believe in a social market economy based on a successful market operating subject to certain rules intended to guarantee the general interest. Specifically, at the moment, this means the protection of investors.	0.829338120768233
This basic principle of liberalisation, increased competition and greater investment opportunities, together with prudence to ensure the protection which investors deserve, has determined and inspired my Group' s position on most of the controversial points which have arisen.	0.7088084167065487
Firstly, there is the problem of investment in non-harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive.	0.8163357436114624
It is clear that by extending the proposal under discussion, the options and the range of investments in undertakings for collective investments, those undertakings which remain outside the rules will be obliged to invest in high-risk funds.	0.7008858110400633
It would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments.	0.5869754607957754
Secondly, the problem of derivatives is one which has created the most divisions, both within my Group and between the groups.	1.0656116889752998
We have achieved a compromise solution.	0.6509211406383505
Everyone accepts that investments in derivatives must be legally limited in order to prevent a harmonised fund losing all its assets due to an investment in high-risk products.	0.6314880230475586
It is clear that this risk is greater when the investment is in derivatives not dealt in on a regulated market, namely the famous OTC derivatives.	0.615860052289377
We have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this, or so we believe, which I welcome.	0.9580697501925189
As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage, I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament.	1.0075697736617422
The texts before us today are old and were already old when they reached this House. This was because they were substantially amended during the Finnish Presidency.	0.7948662710416495
We are therefore faced with two options. We can either return the proposals to the Commission for the latter to present a harmonised text or we can continue the current process.	0.9707241182370213
This second option has won the day and I am pleased about this. However, in the future I hope that the coordination between these two institutions and the Council can be improved so that our work is more understandable and more productive.	1.038441199009741
Mr President, the Socialist Group supports the Commission' s efforts to implement the action plan for financial services.	0.8317142455316119
Obviously, in the wake of the introduction of the euro, we need to create an integrated European financial market which is similar to the American and Japanese markets.	0.8616006260346966
The debates on UCITS gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee.	0.702722913219107
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and also Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, for their constructive approach.	0.8513641622237272
The Socialists recognise the importance of the investment fund industry to the development of our economies and to the allocation of resources.	0.7937350454763257
But the world of international finance is a dangerous one.	0.7690812153592301
The capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses.	0.4679163225238719
There is at present a surfeit of cash looking for a home.	0.5656863245321371
In 1999, the increase in the means of payment in the world resulted in over-stimulated stock exchanges and an explosion in the volume of transactions, pushing up the prices of long-term financial and real assets.	0.6992375975247547
And as international financial activity speeds up, the risks increase.	0.6427496726137072
You do not need a Nobel prize in economics to realise that the current working hypothesis of the financial markets, which anticipate annual growth in profits of the order of 15 to 25% is quite simply unrealistic in the medium term.	0.7751565207002313
I adamantly believe that the main risk to the world economy in the foreseeable future is not inflation, but deflation generated as the speculative bubbles, created by what Alan Greenspan calls irrationally exuberant markets, burst.	0.7426451572377886
The legislature has a duty to contain the risk inherent in the continuing deregulation of the European financial markets.	0.6602659633846437
By definition, investment funds use other people' s money.	0.506672345404769
The legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses.	0.428104383951673
There is no freedom without rules.	0.6454493564316554
We have done away with so-called master-feeder structures.	0.5476328074567408
These feeder funds exist in the United States, which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system.	0.8672418289868906
The European market is still fragmented and such structures would doubtless cause problems.	0.45179936116751834
The Socialists, like the Commission, question the advisability of allowing investment funds to invest in so-called over-the-counter derivatives, i.e. products negotiated between professionals by private contract.	0.6411618420287051
As these transactions are generally not subject to prudential control, the risks are all the more obvious.	0.723195828700536
The Socialist Group has tabled amendments proposing both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clauses in order to contain the risks to investors.	0.5244025894906157
By adopting these amendments, Parliament will allow recourse to OTC derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors.	0.6043567902396729
Mr President, there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance.	0.7710469468751205
This principle should not only guide the public sector, it should also guide the private sector, especially financial undertakings.	0.9810103265820173
Mr President, our objective in setting a framework for unit trusts and other UCTIS is to secure the highest possible safe return for our savers, which is why I want to address the issue of derivatives in my remarks today.	0.819573921935477
I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure, safer, higher returns.	0.5419427869943018
Despite their image of danger, derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance.	0.36877024662197533
A contract that, for example, pays a substantial sum if, say, the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index falls, causes an extra payment by the investor if the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index rises.	0.4783586217026676
Is this speculative?	0.1692486622759503
Not at all.	0.34212614525551716
Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident: they have good management, good prospects and they are good investments.	0.7103730165291339
Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse, as it did in 1987.	0.7959222230622911
You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash, but that would be to waste your research into the winners.	0.8400021694250914
It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall.	0.43403363962438873
The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls.	0.4576905473789251
But even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheaper, perhaps insuring you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index, you would still have the portfolio and the shares, but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse.	0.6939921198270101
In exchange, you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets.	0.6744880941687109
In this case, which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers, you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk.	0.7662533524437473
That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund.	0.6205908270051588
History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation.	0.39633635540926265
Heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers.	0.6496540858971913
Pension funds which suffered from rules on where they could and could not invest, as required by of our government bonds, made returns of 5.2% a year, barely half the 9.5% annual returns made by free funds between 1984 and 1996.	0.5896871548502317
These are of course the returns after deducting all losses.	0.6436135140310916
Do not confuse a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off.	0.5945626145136726
This is what we should be concerned about here today.	0.9661691913359056
Mr President, the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in Europe, including the most sophisticated forms of investment.	0.829750259622507
We do not, in principle, oppose this industry.	0.6672605570992309
However, unlike Mr Christopher Huhne, we feel that a continent which has proved incapable of controlling its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may, in time, provoke the same type of crisis.	0.6445340911096529
We shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group.	0.5771540049321457
But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole.	0.7919133439178236
We shall also vote in the future against any proposals to deregulate the financial markets and we call on all the other political groups to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income is finally harmonised.	0.7403424405378657
For years certain countries, including Great Britain, have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens.	0.6806320968451575
They even reject the strict minimum, i.e. the Monti package proposed by the Commission in Brussels.	0.7899284525535116
This attitude is turning Europe into a machine which exempts investment income from tax and shifts the whole tax burden to commercial income, with all the social and even moral consequences which that implies.	0.5826351775689879
We must put an end to this.	0.5765430794676606
By blocking the demands of the financial industry, the European Parliament has the means to ensure that countries which have been turned into tax havens end up with their back against the wall.	0.9346567635435064
Mr President, the 1985 directive introduced a sort of European visa for certain types of UCITS which could be marketed throughout the Union.	0.6107886835274976
Since then, the capital market and transferable securities have not just continued to evolve; thanks to unbridled financial globalisation, they have exploded exponentially and without restraint.	0.6204107693669918
This brings us to the two proposals for directives.	0.7395567950971675
The second proposal, on which the report is excellent, does not require any particular comment.	0.9372740485278467
It aims to strengthen consumer protection and security.	0.5146155601091791
It is a step in the right direction, even if one wonders why in heaven, with what right and with what respect for our citizens, we are further bolstering the monopoly of the English language in all documents distributed throughout Europe.	0.7596336197007538
That is the thrust of an amendment which we have tabled; it favours all the languages of the Community and our agreement to the second directive will depend on it.	0.9843353636961921
The same cannot be said of the first proposal.	0.685722840643271
We might have been able to agree to the original text insofar as it was informed by a legitimate concern to update current legislation.	0.7369253272549864
However, we are unable to agree to the text of the report, although I welcome the work carried out by Mr Schmidt, for several reasons.	0.9950797991679167
First, it leans too far towards products based on indexes which have no bearing on the real economy; derivatives which will help to swell the financial bubble which Mr Lipietz referred to just now.	0.6464499836642557
Secondly, like him, I think that we should not promote excessive concentration in funds which, in the final analysis, will prove to be a Trojan horse for American pension funds.	1.034285984201904
There is, of course, no reciprocity in favour of European UCITS.	0.6303408768412311
We shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the Member States to increase to 35% ...	0.7252884148999702
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.07650392215616267
Mr President, this is a vital issue for Europe.	0.9410341937696348
A Europe that faces an impending pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their savings.	0.5484354998833959
I welcome many of the developments which Mr Schmidt' s report brings us.	0.593596117183369
UCITS are a success story within the European Union.	0.512229109754029
They are a safe product, traded cross-border.	0.500728268631632
But it is time for the legislation to be updated.	0.889795162462051
Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here.	0.38581325342304174
It is no secret that I would have much preferred Mr Schmidt' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through Parliament.	0.8663646222333509
But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach on this issue.	0.8255759269598556
The radical step taken by this report is to allow UCITS to use over-the-counter derivatives.	0.5592165292427944
I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS.	0.714911922672999
We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation. We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans.	0.7992462513400036
Mr Schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivatives.	0.610603325618421
We must not be afraid to go forward, to react to changes in the market.	0.9309034747091042
Yes, we need to continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumers.	0.8237217042224657
The report gives very adequate protection for consumers.	0.4641328684205328
But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives.	0.6148779881777472
I feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts, which can only help individual people around Europe obtain a high return on their savings.	0.6601386615505583
I salute Mr Schmidt.	0.1586841878054916
Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn.	0.5013724791811736
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an update for you on the curtain and window situation.	0.7503717731918184
If we open this curtain, then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away.	0.6869331424607934
We will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sitting. However, I will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies.	0.9904262123106593
Mr President, the UCITS directive has been an enormous success since it entered into force on 1 October 1989, mainly thanks to the excellent protection which it offers investors.	0.7401083145122767
The directive and the reputation which UCITS enjoy with investors have allowed the investment fund industry to multiply its assets in the European Union fivefold.	0.5093405376653632
There has been a strong increase in cross-border marketing of investments within the European Union and the directive itself is used as a model for legislation throughout the world.	0.8182942268781509
However, the directive is ten years old and, now that the markets have developed and more and more sophisticated financial products are available, it is somewhat outdated.	0.924533110377378
The Commission proposals being debated here will give it the face-lift it needs.	0.5611111388506342
I share some of the concerns expressed here, especially by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, but this face-lift would be even more successful if the funds which simply reproduce a stock exchange index, and which are therefore managed either passively or not at all, and the funds which use an index as a benchmark for an actively-managed fund were treated in the same way, if only to allow medium-sized undertakings listed on the stock exchange but not included in the stock exchange index better access to the capital market.	0.8078442766785474
In addition, investors often have better protection with an actively-managed fund.	0.39164017003249524
My Amendment No 47 is therefore a warning for amateurs.	0.6274958720069335
As far as the proposal for a new provision limiting investments in the same group to 15% is concerned, I would like to stress that, apart from the fact that this limit is too low, the text does not define the concept of a group. This concept does not exist under European law because it is impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice.	0.8748314065812068
I shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment.	0.8427336385666855
To conclude, Mr President, allow me to remind the House that the directive needs a makeover which will make UCITS even more attractive, but it does not need to be strapped into a European corset which will squeeze the life out of it.	0.7941374379916165
- (DE) Mr President, the introduction of the euro and the further liberalisation of capital markets has already produced a larger and deeper European financial area, which is helping to open up markets and create price transparency, but also to increase competition.	0.8054015369141841
At the same time, it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings, particularly those we are concerned with today.	0.8569575834901242
At the end of 1999 there were almost 15 000 investment funds registered as UCITS with a total value of in excess of EUR 2 billion, thereby accounting for roughly 75% of all funds assets.	0.6486331512881371
Hence the Commission rightly cited the economic importance thereof in its proposals for draft directives, and I must say that I actually have every confidence in the Commission' s proposal.	0.8624701197053577
We are all aware how difficult it is to improve a legal framework for investment funds, and how difficult it is to construct the European passport for management companies around particular standards which are to apply even-handedly across the board.	0.8128130115409119
This therefore represents a step forward in respect of the legal and supervisory stipulations for financial markets and financial products.	0.7822322248476877
It is also my primary concern to optimise consumer protection in this way and I think it is very important for this to be reflected in the Commission' s proposal and that of the European Parliament, as well as in the compromise motions.	1.0924242845881251
However, I do not believe that we can assess the risk associated with the OTC derivatives, and I also think that as a European Parliament it is our duty to inform and impress again and again on consumers - who expect investment funds to be comparable with a traditional savings agreement when it comes to long-term security, and indeed that is why they were known as investment savings - that these products do not bear comparison and that is why we need a minimum level of protection.	0.9877207846334481
Why do we not take our cue from the minimum level of protection afforded by the trade in transferable securities directive, Article 11 for example, which relates to good practice?	0.7551171491807792
I therefore believe that this is another step forward we can take and I think it would also be a positive move if consumers and investors could be made aware of a fund' s name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile.	0.8337129547949037
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions.	0.7492443560161297
The preparatory work has largely consisted of a viable balance between increasing the efficacy and growth of the European investment markets and preserving a sufficient level of protection for consumers who buy fund units.	0.634378803458004
The greater the trust consumers have in investment market operations, the more consumers will be prepared to invest on the open market.	0.6673688200762484
And the more consumers invest, the brighter the prospects will be in the European business money markets.	0.9641421814786911
It is quite clear that when businesses can more easily have access to their own capital-based finances their financial structure will be more firmly based, and, thus, opportunities for growth and investment will also improve.	0.7255990341056087
Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here.	0.49419632625808396
Although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment, the debate we had was not the easiest one.	0.8739630816929278
For me personally at least, difficulties were caused by the directive' s technical division into two different proposals, which certainly did not make it easier to familiarise oneself with this very difficult technical subject.	0.6669163526912445
However, I would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals.	0.8538961551246609
Firstly, I am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments.	0.9093101868370203
As regards derivatives, I consider the position adopted by the committee justified - unlike Mrs Randzio-Plath, for example.	0.9035830188982601
The directive should not treat over-the-counter derivatives differently from standard derivatives because they are used in many Member States and were also used before.	0.6596134234842369
With regard to Article 5g of the other proposal for a directive, the so-called Article on Delegation, I think the Commission' s original proposal on rules concerning authorisation was better than the one now approved in the committee, so I would support some of Mrs Villiers' amendments to this point.	0.9404993932616402
Mr President, I see two problems with this morning' s debate.	0.8147829406703705
Firstly, when I came to this Parliament many years ago I was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a Liberal.	0.8221695260066468
Now I have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the Luxembourg Members are in the Chamber at one time - and they are.	0.9028596734522342
Firstly, I welcome proposal No 1.	1.0556137327172805
It simplifies things and brings things up to date.	0.3545421739446326
I think many of the British Members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report.	0.9739704706485539
We support the Schmidt report on proposal No 1, but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks.	0.7809699918444032
We believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward.	0.8362061075833982
Secondly, we consider proposal No 2 to be very confused.	1.0510851587703824
It is difficult to understand, and we think the Commission would be well advised to look at it again.	1.0209291411516863
If further regulation is needed, we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive.	0.8030372699988366
In particular, we disagree with the proposal on capital requirements because if they are put too high they could actually drive some businesses out of the industry altogether.	0.7197475579694051
We ask the Commission to look again at these proposals.	0.7731342733610518
Finally, we would urge Members to vote in particular against Amendment No 41 on capital requirements, because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry.	1.0716531431118428
Mr President, money does not smell, as the Romans would say.	0.7703969891838863
The important thing is for money to generate more money.	0.4482099079863604
This is the only opportunity that we have to see to it that the interests of economists converge with those of people who want to earn money and have their mind set on dollars, like Disney' s Scrooge McDuck, who has dollar signs for eyes, except in this case the symbol is that of the euro.	0.8970305409386207
In this we are combining the interests of these citizens with the interests of pensioners who want to live life in tranquillity.	0.6235719427688408
For example, my brother-in-law, who lives in Rome, started drawing his pension a year ago and every day since - from seven in the morning when he wakes until midnight - he has checked the TV screen to see how the pensions funds and the securities in which he has invested are performing.	0.745162176754028
Pensioners will, in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal.	1.066729431447491
Indeed, whilst the young are penniless, the elderly have accumulated money and, since they are keen to turn it to good advantage, harbour great hopes for this directive.	0.7673545563748426
If national governments had in their hearts - as the European Union has in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earned during the course of a working life, the pensions time bomb would already have been defused.	0.8616697159241785
You too, in your role, Commissioner Bolkestein, have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and of pensioners, a future that I hope will improve once we have finalised this directive, by which I mean very soon, as has been proposed by Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi.	1.1432663120625757
. (NL) Mr President, could I first of all express my heartfelt thanks to rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has principal authority, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Brian Crowley and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, whom I would like to thank for their thorough and important work on the refinement and extension of the proposals.	0.8314516770203373
Since the approval of Directive 85/611, the investment funds sector has undergone lengthy development and it is now important to modernise the rules.	0.7141826938904693
The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors, which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro.	0.9701364740609069
Since the average European family puts its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and I would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk-spreading are concerned.	0.5997630584763611
The two proposals form a coherent whole.	0.4999462215051213
The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities' (UCITS) can invest.	0.5969176490852476
As already remarked in this session, UCITS are key players within the modern capital markets.	0.3788254874383503
Their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets, in which the principle of risk-spreading is taken into consideration, protected by appropriate supervision.	0.7046183394007715
Since diverse types of investment are permitted, private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques.	0.525769687148177
The second proposal expands the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the EU capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector.	0.656065410388432
By allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross-border basis, these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the Treaty of Rome, which they have been denied for all these years.	0.9396638541111113
The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas.	0.6573327946844426
The Commission will adopt Amendments Nos - and I am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 for the first proposal, and 23, 28 and 32 for the second proposal, since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements.	0.9041365280476845
I also value the ideas put forward in Amendments Nos 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20, although the wording needs to be adapted.	0.6797458545361051
I also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45.	0.42837575932789856
I can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of Amendment No 47.	0.8008772651024043
All the amendments I have listed so far pertain to the first proposal.	0.6463198252044355
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the ideas of Amendments Nos 24, 25, 29, 30, 41 and some parts of 27, which contain sensible suggestions, can be adopted, again formulated appropriately.	0.753150508431094
The Commission has suggested adopting the content of these, with certain changes in the wording.	0.9051142842574982
Moreover, I have taken note of the request made by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to codify the entire text, once it has been approved - Amendment No 7 of the first proposal and Amendment No 22 of the second proposal.	0.9889235493080847
The Commission is in favour of codification and will, in the foreseeable future, once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative, concentrate its efforts on drafting a codified version.	0.8242626873638333
However, I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands.	0.9281581146125373
The Commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal.	0.9881766927315795
This is why the Commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal:	1.042027317609341
Amendment No 8 because the proposed, general reference to assets 'covered by this directive' , instead of the more precise reference to assets 'mentioned in Article 19 of this Directive' , hinders implementation.	0.6266958641328397
This Amendment could also lead to different interpretations in the Member States, which might well look for similar instruments in other articles of the directive.	0.6554560087235949
Amendment No 16 jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms.	0.42466231793783976
Neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions.	0.5646898921267578
We cannot, therefore, adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason.	0.6143604868826421
Amendment No 42 relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive.	0.7160986677583151
I therefore cannot see any reason why Article 22, paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason.	0.6046934698833247
Amendment No 44 cannot be accepted because, if it is prescribed that non-harmonised funds are subject to rules which have been 'imposed by the directive' concerning lending, borrowing, selling from an uncovered position and the third party custodian, this will indeed lead to a situation where very few funds, for example Swiss funds, would be eligible for investment.	0.8149958075856076
This goes against the Commission' s intention to widen the scope of investments, and the wording thereof could contravene GATS agreements.	0.7085682591277803
Amendment No 47 is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first paragraph of Article 22a are concerned, because this proposal completely clashes with the spreading rules of Article 22, especially when the UCITS are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospectuses, as discussed in the Council.	0.817910108434287
The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes.	0.7185782462418444
The Commission points out that, according to the national legislation of some Member States, the use of OTC derivatives for general investment purposes is already authorised.	0.6431810052509529
However, the Commission will be suspending its position, given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments.	0.7994904565890094
I believe that OTC instruments could lead to problems, because they are not liquid, the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks.	0.839272674824942
It seems inconsistent to opt for an extremely prudent approach with regard to investments as non-harmonised funds or deposits and, at the same time, freely to allow investments in clearly more risky OTC instruments.	0.4859234158646253
By rejecting the rapporteur' s Amendment No 39, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has aligned itself with the Council.	0.6765782357519015
The upshot of this amendment by Parliament would be that funds are allowed, in theory, to invest in OTC instruments and to trade the rights of participation in their funds across the entire internal market.	0.7215113666997836
In practice, access to other EU markets for these theoretically harmonised funds which invest in OTC instruments can be blocked by applying different national legislative frameworks and protective measures against OTC investments. This would contravene the fact that EU legislation applies to all funds which invest in OTC instruments.	0.5273782626672415
Given this possibly negative effect on the internal market and the risks inherent in OTC instruments, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 15, 37, 38, 39, 43, 46 and 48 and parts of Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45 which pertain to OTC instruments.	0.6331638344237378
As far as the second proposal is concerned, I already mentioned that the Commission will take into consideration many amendments.	1.0640849737494338
Despite this, there are some amendments which the Commission cannot adopt: Amendment No 26, which does not seem to observe the order in which licences are granted and activities start; parts of Amendment No 27, especially the part where the prevention of conflicts of interests is deleted, the delegation of tasks is restricted to components of management decisions and the general decision-taking of Member States concerning delegation is repealed; Amendment No 31 because the Commission is of the opinion that the application of Article 44 of the directive in unchanged form has proved adequate for the trading in rights of participation in UCITS.	0.7681176777828632
The application of the provisions of the directive concerning the performance of services in the field of investments in securities, better known as ISD, is therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulties or confusion.	0.8273787291743309
Amendment No 33 is ambiguous regarding 'the language' of the guest member state, especially when there are various official languages, and it is questionable what will be gained from translations in two other languages.	0.7248197867254251
Amendment No 34 is unacceptable because a simple deletion of the reference to pension funds can create ambiguity as to whether or not a management company can carry out these activities.	0.6047133461999963
I think that pension funds could also benefit from this possibility, provided that management companies are not lumped together with pension funds, but may only carry out part of the management per delegation.	0.7373898834682672
Amendment No 35 cannot be accepted because legally, it cannot command any authority.	0.7157071536464816
Management companies which are denied access to a Member State would need to re-incorporate as a different legal entity in order to be permitted in another Member State.	0.6931625521592387
Amendments Nos 49, 50 and 51, which share the same basis, are not acceptable because they make substantial changes to the consistent approach of the Commission regarding the regulations of third party delegation, and do not offer sufficient security to the competent authorities and investors.	0.8858927736176201
I would like to finish off by commenting on the remarks made by a few Members this morning and, Mr President, with your permission, I will do this in English.	0.9851019293188148
First of all, regarding the remarks of Mr Crowley, who asked whether the second proposal could not simply consist in taking over a pure ISD approach; the objections of the Commission to that proposal would be the following: such an approach would pose difficulties which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authorities and non-consistent sets of rules; moreover there would be no provisions whatsoever on conflicts of interest.	0.7006583946568323
For example, a management company might be doing underwriting business and, if not able to sell, it would put the securities in the fund it would manage, or else there might be difficulties in which order business should be executed if the management company did brokering business.	0.7704188682841323
Furthermore the proposal put forward by Mr Crowley would require a change of the ISD which at present - as I am sure he already knows - does not cover collective management business.	0.8953925593492518
Lastly, his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render ISD activities.	0.6585489169443329
As regards the question put by Mr Huhne, his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations.	0.578147607547418
But hedging operations are already allowed in the existing Article 21(1) of Directive 611/85 on UCITS.	0.5023036408445695
So what Mr Huhne wants is already possible.	0.3411810309791876
A question has been put by Mrs Villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management.	0.5546202422572133
That is also something which is allowed under present legislation. I refer to the same Article 21 I referred to in relation to Mr Huhne' s question.	0.9102697325877379
In her question Mrs Kauppi asks why the Commission has prepared a package of measures distributed in two separate proposals. The reason is that the first proposal focuses essentially on the product, while the second proposal focuses essentially on the service provider, and on prospectuses for UCITS.	0.985774607889997
The separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of problems would facilitate the negotiating process in the Council.	0.6954194369931163
The Commission has not only to listen to Parliament and take into account parliamentary proposals but, as is well-known, must also deal with the Council.	1.1396757799701933
That is the reason why the Commission has put forward these two separate proposals.	1.0062951493654895
Lastly, Mr Balfe has complained that there are, in his opinion, too many limits in the whole proposal the Commission has put forward.	1.0953842586162856
It seems to us that these limits are justified: firstly, by the need to diversify investments; secondly, because of the vulnerability to the need to reimburse investment at any time; thirdly, in order to avoid an inordinate influence over the investment funds.	0.7999972405450009
These are the reasons why the Commission believes, because of the prudence that has to be exercised in this field, that these various limits are necessary.	1.0336431982559557
The debate is closed.	0.04146649521247962
The vote will take place at 12 noon.	0.5604071516729585
Mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States	0.18991452817732826
The next item is the report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union.	0.5542246395652995
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in letters dated 3 August 1999 and 3 December 1999, the Council called on the European Parliament, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty, to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the Member States aimed at guaranteeing improved mutual assistance in criminal matters.	0.779380127587718
It is thus, as you can see, a very important draft, that will effectively serve to provide the Member States of the Union with a more comprehensive and consistent instrument for mutual assistance.	1.1832696053521388
In actual fact, there are still certain differences of opinion within the Council over the type of convention, and over certain provisions contained therein.	0.8320189102612295
Some of these differences have already been ironed out, but others persist.	0.9503900882758727
The spirit of the proposal is nevertheless to equip those responsible for applying the law - primarily the judiciary, but also the citizens concerned - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime, which respects fundamental guarantees as regards defence and general principles of human rights.	0.880150063840187
It is for this reason that, despite the many omissions in the text, the provisions set out therein could - and I say could, Mr President - be accepted on condition that they are suitably amended in order to ensure they can be implemented by those responsible for applying the law and are acceptable to the citizens.	0.9730589772447532
The Commission has proposed various amendments to this end, all of which aim to systematically restructure the Council proposal by suggesting a series of technical adjustments that will render the text harmonious and consistent as regards the amendments proposed.	0.739845404913851
The amendments can be summarised as follows: they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence, introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible, and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications, an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various Member States of the Union.	0.6967194129275734
The proposal, as formulated by the Council and subsequently amended by the Commission, provides for a convention based on three titles: the first lays down guidelines for ensuring the consistency of procedures and formalities for letters rogatory; the second lists a whole series of specific requests for mutual assistance and defines the formalities and procedures which must be followed in relation to these specific types of mutual assistance; the third and last provides for and codifies the procedures via which telephone conversations conducted by citizens in a State other than the one instigating proceedings can and must be intercepted.	0.7386935891669367
Mr President, international cooperation is certainly needed in order to tackle both cross-border crime and crimes which are committed in one State, but the evidence for which is to be found in another.	0.8577788382155915
It is nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other, even more delicate issues into account: the whole issue of double jeopardy, that of specialities, and that of the credibility of one Member State of the Union in respect of the judicial authorities of other Member States of the Union.	1.0544180072664815
These are thus extremely important questions, which we hope that the Council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion.	0.9885763322176337
As regards other aspects of this subject, Mr President, I would refer you to my written report.	0.7811695668684411
- (ES) Mr President, I want to start by saying that I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party which I represent on this issue.	0.7967258282776568
I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Council is not present today.	0.9709497928505753
By contrast, I welcome the attentive presence of Commissioner Vitorino, as has consistently been the case since his appointment. This leads me to another point.	0.902664494496532
This House has only prepared one report on this Convention. It was in fact consulted on a text which was not the text being worked on by the Council and which did not contain points which had already been agreed.	0.9403353106531844
I condemn this, as well as the Council' s absence.	0.738043731850128
These are serious matters on which this House must act.	0.6022814607422442
We are about to advance into new territory where attitudes and symbols are of great significance.	0.3965445680125953
A political community is reflected in the justice which it hands out.	0.5140401207878795
This is why this report is so important.	1.068996515042616
It represents a step towards the area of freedom, security and, particularly, justice to which we all aspire.	0.9320491516189806
It is also an important step towards European natural justice. This will be built on mutual confidence between the Member States and their respective legal systems and on the confidence of the European people in any European court.	1.054328108079748
It will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular.	0.8122290394459557
It is in this respect that this House has significantly - and in my opinion rightly - altered the balance proposed by the Council by firmly and decidedly supporting a reinforcement of these guarantees of fair trials in all the amendments.	1.0545062165120263
Mr President, as the rapporteur said, this House has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the Convention.	0.9674311014245068
On behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have tabled an amendment to the motion for a resolution which asks the Council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible.	0.8685936157138606
The regulation of phone tapping in the Council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate.	0.6327809433556268
Yet a lack of regulation is also inappropriate and may lead to abuses in the telecommunications field. In fact, we are aware that these are already happening widely.	0.7755602921719499
The other point which I must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video conferencing with regard to accused persons.	0.7576368832395809
Again on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have asked the Council to produce a convention as soon as possible in order to clarify and supplement the regulation of this issue, which is frankly unsatisfactory.	0.9337786233566491
Apart from a few exceptions, the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party will vote in favour of the committee' s amendments, and of course our own.	1.006156267430882
Mr President, it is our opinion that one facet of the construction of Europe hinges on the construction of a common judicial system, for the Europe that we want to build, which comprises administrative law, civil law, both substantive and procedural, and criminal law, both substantive and procedural.	0.9964200866927587
The Convention on Mutual Assistance and Criminal Matters, which we are examining today, is but a stitch in the great fabric of the corpus iuris of Europe, which has its natural foundation in fundamental human rights and freedoms.	0.9107961451545702
Thus it is that legal cooperation and cooperation on criminal matters must also strictly respect fundamental rights, principles which lie at very root of our culture and our civilisation: I am thinking of fair trials, and more particularly of the rights of the defence, of the impartiality and integrity of judges, of the length of legal proceedings, for which my country, Italy, unfortunately has the worst record in terms of the number of sentences handed down, of the cases pending before the European Court of Human Rights.	0.8649814672590744
Restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law.	0.7575699017622194
The report that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has substantially amended with regard to its original formula, taking up many of the amendments we have presented, still leaves room for a certain confusion, in relation to the way in which the interception of telecommunications and video conferences are to be regulated.	0.878532522235793
The news received in recent weeks on the way in which modern technologies facilitate interceptions mean that greater attention must be paid to this issue: we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and troubled than the dark scenes depicted by Orwell.	0.6905264757832685
This is only the beginning of a great project in the field of law, which should advance hand in hand with the growth the type of Europe we want to see.	0.9144682947719649
Mr President, committee amendments and political group amendments may be tabled in plenary, but not amendments from individual Members.	0.7156177802853155
Mr Schulz should be aware of this.	0.540946211577128
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully understand the frustration of Mr Di Pietro who, in a short space of time, has had to carry out an extraordinary amount of work in order to be able to submit this report to us today.	0.8137226466218648
Crime in the European Union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step-by-step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs.	0.760357958760725
The European Parliament is certainly not to blame for this.	0.9344755068784064
It is the governments of the Member States who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree.	0.7388330589174409
As a result, the European Parliament is faced with an almost impossible task.	0.9125053106816192
One has to content oneself with the idea that all means, however slight, must be seized upon in order to set up better legal assistance.	0.8373569093976325
By way of paradox, I could say that it would be best if as little as possible was said about this report, for the clearer we make it that only very small steps are being taken, the more the world of crime will gloat and the more the acute imbalance between organised crime and the desperate lack of judicial cooperation will become obvious.	0.8524520904571532
I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council of Ministers to finally face reality, that is to say the fact that crime is developing faster than the law.	0.9089829368813159
The goal is, after all, to provide the judicial bodies - magistrates, in the first place, but also the citizens involved - with the instruments to fight crime without prejudice to the fundamental guarantees of defence and the general principles of human rights.	0.9236950424091593
If not, we will be fighting a running battle.	0.822993434482458
I therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the EU Member States in the first instance.	0.949810509528715
In my opinion, this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States.	0.8485455616849228
As long as this harmonisation has not been achieved, however, we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance.	0.9118013695639927
To this end, I had submitted an amendment stipulating that legal assistance can only be granted in the event of criminal prosecution instituted by the authorities based on facts which are punishable according to the national law of the petitioning party and the Member State petitioned.	0.8221772977724863
The content of my amendment is, in fact, echoed in Amendment No 43, which also stipulates this condition of accrual.	0.7911395339898561
This condition of accrual is essential since, in my opinion, the principle of nulla poena sine lege, legality in criminal law, must be observed.	0.6430520815191032
As such, any request for legal assistance concerning a hypothetical action which is not a crime in the petitioned Member State contravenes this principle of legality and thus the fundamental principles of justice in the petitioned Member State.	0.6731763854055495
Hence, it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted.	0.7136932080930615
Finally, I would like to reiterate that Mr Di Pietro has, in my opinion, delivered sterling work by submitting a report which, within the limitations, offers all possible guarantees for safeguarding individual human rights and fundamental freedoms.	0.676532402842804
If, however, we would like to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation.	0.8282271699309681
Mr President, my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs.	0.8148120942602805
The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government.	0.5936248477601047
The present proposal is complex, because it deals with agreements between Member States but has far-reaching consequences for the citizen-government relationship.	0.8032771258328809
It is precisely in the field of legal protection that the Council' s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired.	0.830241415974402
In the words of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro, the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings.	0.6961055550879836
Thanks to the agreement, it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests, whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different Member States.	0.7620033879724017
The chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court.	0.7306431513212991
Additional measures are hence required, such as the obligation on the part of criminal investigators to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used.	0.5369211592109498
The fact that the Council' s proposal rides roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my Group.	0.748882153262735
There are certainly no restrictions in its scope.	0.35003052254707995
As such, the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime.	0.7584528271371836
In fact, it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law.	0.7635479263605282
It is, therefore, conceivable that the European Union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will vanish in the dust.	0.7379136611508054
Mr President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters that we are examining today contains the minimum requirements for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies concerned.	0.7172110529867219
It pertains, among other things, to notifications, information exchanges, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of property, testimonies via video conferences, investigative activities and 'undercover' activities, and the interception of telephone calls.	0.669190031970821
This is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached, and it should immediately be said that if any amendments, such as Amendments Nos 32 or 81, or the revised Amendments Nos 70 or 71, were to be passed, the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped, and we would vote against it.	0.9640525723907095
I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments.	0.7175971834772515
The fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this Parliament.	0.7793824013391779
As Commissioner Vitorino will have noted in all the various speeches, the need has emerged to draw up a framework of common rules, which is to say that we cannot continue in this manner, with this disparate agenda, with these piecemeal agreements which relate to diverse sectors such as that of investigation.	1.0430517172106815
What is, on the other hand, absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the Community, and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible, and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement.	0.8656441919623418
My thoughts turn to what may become of this Community, of these conventions and judicial relations if, for example, a fascist country such as Turkey became a member of the Union. It would truly perplex me.	0.9856091108682931
We need a corpus iuris - as everyone has said - and common rules, especially procedural ones, which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the Community.	0.9564651007752742
It is clear that this is primarily an issue for the IGC and one that addresses an aspiration to which this Parliament can only make a limited contribution in as much as everything depends on the Council and the Commission.	0.9137268966826784
I believe that this first half of the year, in which we have a Commissioner from Portugal and Portuguese Presidency of the Council, provides an excellent opportunity to give an initial spur to this shared aspiration.	0.9656250055270446
It is precisely for this reason that we are in favour of adopting Amendments Nos 78 and 79, which already prefigure a minimum of set rules on interceptions and on video conferences.	0.8168023729299749
On the one hand, we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote, precisely so that this convention - which, I repeat, already sets minimum rules - is not stripped of all meaning, while on the other hand we are also looking forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the Commission with a view to definitively putting into effect this minimum Community law.	0.8571862475781068
Mr President, confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level, the Member States must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible.	0.6848039124748714
Indeed, they must set in place the institutional conditions needed to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law - a process that must nevertheless cover all the stages needed to prevent the untimely impositions that are detrimental to legitimate national prescriptions in the field of justice, over which Member States have sovereign powers, and above all to prevent impositions that result in riding roughshod over basic civil rights.	0.7482725117353903
We must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the Council which, as the rapporteur himself has underlined, now claims, after years of discussion, to have found a universal solution in the space of a few months.	1.0000951811691245
Furthermore - and I agree with the assessment made by Mr Di Pietro - the Council' s text would appear to be overladen with contradictions, inconsistent propositions and omissions.	0.814340077259055
It is clear that the justice sector, more than any other, cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner.	0.7937370898318469
It is the opinion of our Group that even the report, considered as a whole, would be the subject of much debate, notwithstanding the incorporation of certain corrective amendments that take into account the safeguarding of personal liberty and respect for national sovereignties.	0.8099197640069576
The report contains arguments that are too disparate, which do not link together smoothly, and everything thus hinges on approximations.	0.7315033719095603
We will, in conclusion, vote against this report, while stressing that the Europe to which we aspire is a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that call for gradual and responsible discussion, as well as very serious examination.	0.7784403832353194
We must first establish general rules and institutional certainties. Only then will we be able to institute actual conventions.	0.4868335200868799
Mr President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament on the Bonino List, I intend to confirm the position that we adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties and am thus also announcing our vote on their behalf. It is a vote against this report, or more precisely a vote against the convention on which the report is based.	0.9511217871738862
I would nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work. He listened very closely to our arguments at the committee stage, and particularly those on the issue of respecting the rights of the defence, both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of European mutual assistance.	0.8689475690686218
The committee and the rapporteur have incorporated nine of the eleven amendments that we presented, and these centred precisely on the rights of the defence.	0.8372939454706908
This spurs us to maintain that the European Parliament would have done sterling work in guaranteeing that civil rights and freedoms were safeguarded, if this were a lawmaking parliament and if we were, as part of this procedure, in fact co-legislators - which we are not.	1.0922759029417453
This is the problem, and it is for this reason that we are critical of the position adopted by the Council, which is one we find completely unsatisfactory.	1.1119449389409966
This is a task that has lasted three years, and on which we have been consulted, so to speak, as a matter of course, when this issue, as has already been stressed, comprises highly important formal and substantive facets, which called for a range of assessments, consultations, concerted actions and codecisions.	0.9161747171712885
It would seem to us that the Council has taken the various issues - those of legitimate interceptions, the rights of the defence, the rights of detainees and of the authorities legally empowered to request mutual assistance - a little too lightly.	0.9896474463352852
We should have requested and rejected the first version of the convention, and then requested another: the majority on the committee did not want this and it is for this reason that we will vote against it, even if we hope that the amendments, which nevertheless improve the text, can be incorporated by the Council - we doubt that they will be, but hope all the same that they are.	1.127354856887843
In my Group, there are undoubtedly different views of Mr Di Pietro' s report.	0.6945406703217188
I agree that it is - as has been said - a good and competent piece of work, which has been carried out under difficult conditions.	1.0499573274827994
The Danish Members of the Group cannot vote in favour of the proposal but will, on the contrary, be supporting a number of amendments, especially those tabled by the Greens.	0.9461559028262201
There are two reasons why we are saying no.	0.7844877319529064
Firstly, these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and, to my mind, the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty, which have not been fully realised. This is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support.	0.9918007773474522
The other main reason, however, is that, even though we are concerned here with a Convention (and therefore with international cooperation), there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal. And the trend is towards creating, in the longer term, a common European area of jurisdiction, common EU criminal law and common EU administration of justice.	1.0116439889070008
We would warn against that trend. We have this AFSJ mantra - Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - the full enormity of which lies in its establishment of EU systems which will play havoc with existing legal traditions relating to these sensitive and important questions which are overwhelmingly national in character.	0.6515494794013895
Mr President, I too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom, security and justice which Europe will hopefully one day become.	0.9444810599158364
It is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons, in which there are no frontiers to crime, but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime.	0.9531395597769061
A small step - I say - but nonetheless a welcome one, for which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has quite correctly wanted to prescribe further restrictions and guarantees in the name of the defence of the fundamental rights of the individual that are in force in the Member States and in the Union itself, even if these are not yet enshrined in a European Union charter of rights, which we hope will soon come into being: just restrictions and guarantees because, unfortunately, existing rights are, in practice, not always respected by every public authority in every Member State.	0.9321661075608741
Certain isolated passages in the Commission' s proposal perhaps err on the side of caution, as is the case when it is maintained that the detainee accused should be given the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of preliminary enquiries.	0.8145599441921423
I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation.	0.8298647502830598
Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link.	0.751650487318884
These are nevertheless minor flaws, which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote.	1.0038887234097391
The rapporteur has made laudable efforts, which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him.	1.0913652649362933
The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account.	0.7670726555717444
There is, as has already been said, one point still to resolved, which is also the most delicate one: it concerns article 18 of the convention, which relates to the interception of communications originating in one Member State, but which are directly performed by another Member State, without the assistance being requested of the State in which the interception is being carried out, something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology.	0.9848038384770489
This is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse.	0.6901376379409302
It could be maintained that in overall terms the legislation proposed is better than nothing, but to the Commission it nevertheless appeared insufficient and far from reassuring.	0.8232221177377829
It thus merits further reflection which, at a time in which the ambivalent reports on ECHELON are evoking shades of Big Brother, should probably go into greater detail on the means and methods to be used, on the one hand, to safeguard the rights of the individual, and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime.	0.8378772279704129
The objective is thus to achieve, as closely as possible, a fine balance between the fight against organised crime and respect for personal freedoms and the dignity of the individual: an objective which now specifically applies not only to the Member States, but also to the Union, which is aspiring to become a common area of freedom, justice and security.	0.888476483197237
This is a distant goal, but is one that can be attained in stages.	0.8907922621706906
The most important thing will be the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States, but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward, as it is a step in the right direction.	0.9450537511333511
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement.	0.7038500692774231
It points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal.	0.5458468688510091
The lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty.	0.6109195239457933
Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters.	0.7263265404197538
Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely, and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights.	0.7030445630706692
Article 18 allows interception in another Member State without its involvement.	0.4122946587505176
Not only should this be deleted, the whole interception title should be scrapped.	0.746116296595244
An initiative of the FBI drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation.	0.7330343377724635
The Council proposal containing those requirements, ENFOPOL 98 was approved by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report.	0.5854834841153621
Now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception, and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at.	1.0456489549112855
The requirements propose to allow the authorities access to the facilities of all service providers, that is, telephones, mobile phones, Internet, etc.; and given the current extremely shoddy drafting, this is open to abuse. I would also like to ask: given that the user requirements specify that the police has access to all service providers without exception, does this include Parliament' s in-house service?	0.7846534740482685
Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very, very shoddy grounds?	0.6722751989754454
Furthermore, in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences.	1.003131006530324
This leaves it wide open to abuse.	0.18350820204464838
Again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof, something which is recognised in international, fundamental law, the presumption of innocence is essential.	0.7157221735966739
That is not guaranteed.	0.7609777172979095
Neither the preamble nor the body of the text takes proper account of the rights of the defence, a basic principle of international fundamental rights.	0.756542665579981
This issue is extremely serious.	0.6179698198769454
We are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout Europe which are extremely concerned about these developments.	0.7426764759487178
Mr President, I am neither a member of the Legal Affairs Committee nor a lawyer, but like almost all of us, I understand the need for this Single Economic Area of Europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom, security and justice.	0.937914002135711
In that sense, the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important.	0.8546419671888781
What did I understand on reading the related texts?	0.3730395030493178
That it is dangerous to rely on the provisions made by the Council.	0.7224318679732225
The many contradictions and conflicting views over what Europe is and the many different legal systems could not only lead to confusion and inefficiency but also create dangerous situations.	0.5087387434486118
For example, the situation proposed by Article 18, to which many speakers have drawn attention, where each country, each large country if you will, each country with the technical ability, can enter another country and monitor its telecommunications without even securing the second country' s approval.	0.8468834169816248
In my opinion, the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur Mr Di Pietro have produced some very interesting work.	0.6891915457511837
It is a pity that this very well constructed explanatory statement by Mr Di Pietro could not be conveyed in the telegrammatic five minutes he had here today.	0.6521688598810196
Nevertheless, it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries, defendants and citizens, a path which I think must be pursued much more completely and much more boldly.	0.7765107044085262
I should like, however, to draw your attention to the fact that all this is taking place in a framework in which there is confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law.	0.8480101183790146
A child, a student or a pupil who smokes hashish in one country is dealt with in an educational way, while in another country he is treated as a criminal and locked up in the universities of crime constituted by the corrective system and the prisons.	0.636007807644748
How can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis?	0.5866922740920434
For that reason, in conclusion, I believe we should do something, particularly in the area of harmonisation of laws, not those relating to organised criminal activity, but those concerning punishable activities by the people which are more in the nature of social phenomena.	0.9999004594199398
On behalf of the TDI Group, I should like to take the opportunity afforded by Judge Di Pietro' s report on mutual assistance in criminal matters to refer to a case which is a tragic illustration of the way crime is eroding security in Europe.	0.8304145863335565
On 14 December 1999, a five year-old boy called Clément was found in a sleeping-car on the Calais-Ventimiglia train, crying for his mother who was taking him to visit his sick grandmother.	0.4871960193409007
Corinne Caillaux, who had probably been raped, was found with her throat cut and covered in stab wounds in the lavatories on the train.	0.5478128025826089
The presumed killer, Sid Ahmed Rezala, is also strongly suspected of having murdered the British student Isabel Peake, who was raped and thrown out of the train taking her to see her parents, and another young woman, Émilie Bazin, who was found dead in Amiens under a pile of coal in the building where he lived.	0.6185452847766357
Rezala should never have been in France. He arrived from Algeria at a time when, according to the authorities, immigration had been stopped and there was no reason for him to come.	0.7043859428395373
He should never have stayed in France, having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences, which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country.	0.7534840763125012
He should never have been free because 14 charges of theft, violence and rape had been brought against him, one of which was for the rape of a minor.	0.5798697854861516
He should never have been able to escape from France, but the officers pursuing him had no jurisdiction and European frontiers have more holes than a sieve.	0.5839304269705232
He should never have arrived in Spain, where he mugged a woman at knifepoint and yet was immediately released by the Spanish authorities.	0.5898548048259251
Today, thanks to the complex networks of sexual deviants, he is in Portugal.	0.6689589628677395
Portugal refuses to extradite him on the grounds that he would face a longer prison sentence in France than that provided for in the Portuguese penal code.	0.6037423266040698
I should like to ask the Portuguese minister, the President-in-Office of the Council, to put a stop to this scandal at once.	0.8137531094758051
I should like to ask the House to wake up, at long last, to the appalling situation of the victims of policies for which the establishment, not the yobs, bears full responsibility.	0.953766588384082
Mr President, this agreement deals with a sensitive issue: cooperation in the field of criminal law.	0.7606722749835134
It is therefore understandable that the Council finds it difficult to agree.	0.8098607618582014
Successful application of this agreement by the Member States requires unanimity within the Council.	0.6927358700011336
Only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice.	0.313512984880265
This, however, does not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously.	0.9852408940138945
Quite the reverse, in fact.	0.7788159633854512
The Council' s proposal must comply with legislation of the national Member States in the field of criminal law.	0.7698012776589397
The wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test.	0.6179818462275071
Careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but, above all, by the national parliaments, is therefore of key importance.	0.9988824044167732
Mr Di Pietro' s proposal to omit the current Article 18 regarding intercepting telecommunications, amongst other things, is understandable, although very strict.	0.6976600605400226
The text of Article 18 is ambiguous: he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a Member State in another Member State without the latter' s prior authorisation.	0.6521192680392767
In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State.	0.7283063486907125
Proposed additions, such as repeated references to the ECHR, the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of Member States to implement the ECHR, add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement.	0.748135667725377
I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text.	0.8470763345555684
The Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will, however, despite hesitation, not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote.	0.883078840854778
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation.	0.7780563583118798
This clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much-discussed European citizenship.	0.4803963441950018
On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting.	0.7911654492374893
Pursuant to Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union' s objective is 'to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia' .	0.7475842850842991
The creation of Europol represents one step towards achieving this objective. However, we must take the next step, which is to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to gradually establish a genuine European judicial area consistent with the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	0.7768698351686278
This draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application, at Member State level, of pre-existing conventions on other legal areas. The intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the Member States and in the European Convention on Human Rights.	0.8730768192753167
It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue.	0.7853426943265592
As for videoconferencing, more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded.	0.8037854251490355
The procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights...	0.7153723866109448
(The President cut the speaker off)	0.07650392215616267
Mr President, legislating in criminal matters is often countered, wrongly, with arguments of individual freedom and security.	0.6127468069921965
Is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed?	0.4750518015320269
Is one free when security is no longer assured?	0.5429523809802099
Modern criminal law revolves around the quest for a balance, a dialogue between security and freedom.	0.5607175170899271
And this dialogue is open-ended; it adapts to the demands of the day.	0.7038764927126819
Nowadays, certain forms of crime are cross-border crimes and it is, of course, in the interests of the Member States to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them.	0.76966199720565
But the Council' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts.	0.6054346526087366
First, the form: the draft convention is vague in the extreme, and this is totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society.	0.934698518648867
It is not just a question of style.	0.755894023644419
We are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter.	0.699290199653103
Then the content: the Council draft fudges the obvious difficulty caused by widely differing legal systems, varying practices and a total lack of legal public service standards in certain Member States of the Union.	0.5989241311932394
It makes provision in article 9 for prisoners held in custody to be transferred from one state to another despite the fact that guarantees differ.	0.5599515620993324
I should like to stress this point because it is paramount.	0.8863400097042701
We must not forget that several tens of thousands of people are currently held in custody in the European Union without having stood trial and that, in some states, custody is abused and used as a means of extorting confessions.	0.7666911196994411
It is nothing less than legal torture.	0.42338436360160336
Other European countries, on the other hand, do not accept confession as sufficient proof of guilt.	0.6536484464577826
It is this diversity in our criminal policies which we have to address and legislating properly means looking for genuine legal convergence criteria and facing up to the reality of prisons in Europe, which are often overcrowded places outside the law which are a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves.	0.7909650207306319
Mr President, as you know, all of our countries abolished the death penalty years ago, but with nearly a thousand suicides a year in our prisons, they have not really abolished it?	0.945108099937973
Mr President, co-operation in the field of law is without doubt essential in free market Europe, but it must hinge on the strictest respect for those principles which lie at the very heart of our civilisation: the fundamental human rights and freedoms, laid down in the European Convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.	0.7999774415908217
We can but thank the parliamentary committees, which have - via the introduction of numerous amendments - made far-reaching modifications aimed at providing guarantees to a report which, in its initial format, we did not find at all convincing.	0.9009516459516642
I turn to Mr Schulz in confirming that we always submit amendments not on a personal basis or for personal motives, but in connection with general political concerns.	0.7375095754680178
If it is then a question of listing the areas investigated or researching these, they can be found with the rapporteurs, among them the author of the report on this convention.	0.888588152186272
I thus believe that Mr Schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks.	0.3632609675873489
As I have said, numerous amendments have been incorporated which guarantee the rights of the defence - I am thinking here of the obligation for interceptions to be requested by a judge - or the prohibition on holding both an investigative and a judicial mandate as part of a joint investigation team.	0.8613995226972574
In brief, this Parliament wanted the convention to apply solely to criminal matters; the restrictions on freedom and on fundamental rights set out in the convention can but be limited to criminal matters.	0.7396857089354735
We need hard and fast rules.	0.17958361507088832
The Council has behaved in an unseemly manner, changing tack in mid-course, and is nowhere to be seen.	0.7926811326471076
We would, on the other hand, like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for attending the debate held in this Chamber.	0.881269729170501
As I have said, we need hard and fast rules if we are to have fair trials in Europe - without intrusion from interceptions, without the illicit use of video conferences - because we in Europe should no longer have trials run by magistrates who play politics rather than administer justice, and because punishment should be meted out to the real perpetrators of crime and not to innocent people who someone finds inconvenient.	0.8326074847309647
. Mr President, the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is approaching adoption by the Council.	0.7905434630706976
Most say it is about time.	0.6058072502034461
According to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the Council in April 1997, the work on the draft MLA Convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997.	1.0104907935401082
More time will pass before the Convention actually enters into force, given the fact that this requires Member States' ratification.	0.6585167858148754
Even with the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, foreseeing its entry into force once at least half of the Member States have adopted the Convention, I would like to urge the Member States to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this Convention.	0.772490891614397
Past experience with ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing.	0.5679630772113408
This Convention will not create a new or different system of Mutual Assistance.	0.6055855330584384
Instead it aims at building on tried and tested mechanisms that have been in place for a very long time, such as the ones foreseen by the Council of Europe Convention on mutual assistance of 1959 and the Benelux Treaty.	0.7336621609010529
The draft that the Council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several Members of Parliament.	0.8247999919426515
It is a considerable achievement of the Convention that where at all possible requested Member States shall comply with the formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting Member States.	0.6988946234259663
This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court.	0.6128743227489265
Furthermore, requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities.	0.5933171742995865
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of provisions: those that create an obligation to render assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences, controlled deliveries and on the interception of telecommunications; and those where no such obligation is created and only a legal framework is provided for Member States that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribed, for example, the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert investigations and the sending and service of procedural documents.	0.7433836902166536
The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime.	0.5778427582209282
It is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations.	0.6729799734477638
However, one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence.	1.0081390917435367
I very much appreciate that the report of Mr Di Pietro, whom I salute for the excellent work he has done in such a short period of time, includes the right of defence as one of its main points.	0.873739836926758
At the present time it is entirely up to the Member States to ensure that those rights are respected under the scrutiny of the Council of Europe' s Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.	0.956685911474271
It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights, work on which has just begun.	0.7392474068696105
We must recognise that Article 18 concerns what is clearly a controversial decision.	0.5986114134981404
The article was carefully crafted in Council in very lengthy discussions, in order to ensure that intelligence activities would remain effective and that criminal investigations will be covered.	0.5672318869752916
As far as criminal investigations are concerned, for which I am responsible, I take note of the invitation that was addressed to the Commission and the Council by several Members of the European Parliament to take this issue on board and to address it on a common legal basis, having regard to the relevance the interception of telecommunications may have as evidence before the courts.	0.9525501436314576
The Commission is fully aware of the fact that the draft we have before us is not perfect or ideal.	0.7806610420169184
However, we must be realistic.	1.1969480275010516
The text we have is the result of the mixture of the institutional set-ups foreseen for judicial cooperation in criminal matters under both the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties respectively.	0.5364492700738095
This is what we have, and only practical experience will show us in detail if and where there are shortcomings and what additional steps will have to be taken.	0.9405708097935771
I am quite aware of the fact that the further development of mutual trust and mutual confidence among the judicial systems of the Member States will ease the road we have ahead of us.	0.6219448148418412
Apart from that, the Tampere European Council has already indicated in which direction we, in the Commission, should go.	0.9535925528110231
Among the steps to be taken will be the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the setting-up of the Euro Just project.	0.8968831234038187
The Commission sincerely hopes that the European Parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields.	0.870942728839659

II. the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) with a view to regulating management companies and simplified prospectuses (COM(1998) 451 - C4-0465/1998 - 1998/0242(COD))	0.5396505745419979

(FR) Madam President, when a Swede, a Spaniard, a Luxembourgeois and a German have to negotiate in English, linguistic ambiguities will arise.	0.7087842593270789
I therefore propose, in agreement with the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, that the words 'issued by' be replaced with 'dealt with' throughout Amendment No 37.	0.8487951377960301
The words 'issued by' also need to be added after the words 'transferable securities' .	0.7331411509836799
The amended text will then read, and again I must read it in English, which is the lingua franca of our Parliament: 'transferable securities issued by over the counter derivatives dealt with' , etc.	0.6734914511046807
We must also ensure that Amendment No 45 by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil is amended if it is to be adopted, because the same problem will arise.	0.9398201694114964
Mr Goebbels, I am sorry, but I think you are jumping the gun; Amendment No 37 is an oral amendment proposing that the words 'with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale' be moved. You were asking for the place to be changed.	0.8232815886200299
Madam President, my apologies, I was looking at Amendment No 36, which logically precedes Amendment No 37.	0.9841477549597291
But, you are right, we are discussing Amendment No 37 and here too we have a similar problem.	1.1178552467816016
It is not the establishments but the instruments which should have a high rating.	1.0029404993710094
The text therefore reads: 'instruments with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation' .	0.4182134814299145

Madam President, I asked for the floor before the sitting started in order to say something solely intended for you as President of this House. We have a procedure for visits to be made to this House to report on certain situations.	1.075664551071761
I do respect and agree with this procedure, as I also agree with the freedom of expression for everyone. However, for the second time in a fortnight these visits have been used to attack individuals, political parties, including my own, and institutions.	0.9381885139009691
I feel that this behaviour, particularly in your presence, is unacceptable and totally repugnant, especially when we are on the point of an electoral campaign.	0.9713553870442511
Therefore, particularly out of respect for you, I must say that I do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this.	0.9504625341317053
I was told that this was a personal response.	0.7306900126868775
Note will be taken of it in the Minutes.	0.9226767695699827
Madam President, particularly out of respect for you, for myself and for this House, I did not want to explicitly refer to the issue in question. However, as a Member of this House, as general secretary of a party in the Basque Country and as an ordinary citizen of Spain, I will do so now because of the extremely serious accusations made against individuals and against parties like my own, which has a long democratic tradition, and which has scrupulously respected and defended human rights for many years.	1.0655918252920744
Madam President, I want to express my concern that this clear defence by Mr Knörr Borràs of human rights apparently does not prevent his government from cooperating in Parliament with a political group which not only does not condemn, but collaborates with and encourages, violence against people and property.	0.7415131623464284

I also want to mention the translation problems, of which I will give just one example, as we do not have much time.	1.2128102293268397
Correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts.	0.42879494672382

The term 'legale esterno' has been translated into French as 'avocat neutre' . I have no idea what an 'avocat neutre' is.	0.8112615299172734
It rather seems like a contradiction in terms.	0.23027241283306848

We shall address this problem and check all the translations.	0.5274318035160835
Madam President, I simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote started, to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar.	0.982007694967126
I should like you, Madam President, to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future.	0.8872126445036813

I hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this.	0.6882822874725956
The second sentence should read: '.., weshalb diese Hilfen' (which is why we have this aid), then 'ohne Bedingungen und' (unconditionally and) should be deleted, and it continues as follows: 'ohne Abhängigkeit von reziproken Anweisungen von seiten des Geberlandes gewährt werden müssen' . (and therefore that the aid must not be dependent on the reciprocal orders from the donor countries).	0.7891012353545072

Madam President, I would like, with reference to this report, to underline the problem of translation: reference should be made to the French or Italian version, since the text adopted by this Parliament will also be the authoritative one for the Commission.	1.0586445639695088
We have encountered several problems in some of the other languages, but have not been able to check all of these, and I would thus urge you to be mindful of problems of this type.	0.9972354571867503
Madam President, I voted in favour of the Schmidt report on the regulation of investments in transferable securities because, as I stated in this Chamber this morning, I consider it very important that the monies of the citizens of the European Union be put to good use.	1.0372983334078487
The vast majority of these citizens are elderly people and pensioners, who want a peaceful retirement and who, after the problems encountered during the course of their working lives, have at last found financial peace of mind.	0.7672016152167945
The regulation of investments in transferable securities, the vast majority of which are made by elderly pensioners, is thus a major step forward for the European Union.	0.8792320902018909
Report by Olle Schmidt (A5-0025/2000)	0.2819622247488192
. (SV) Olle Schmidt' s report is an improvement on the Commission' s proposal.	0.6661429375572724
I am not opposed to updating the common minimum regulations enabling a collective investment undertaking to obtain a so-called EU passport.	0.5575326653081579
However, I do not consider it would be appropriate to do this before all Member States have approved Commissioner Monti' s proposal for minimum taxes on capital.	1.0165209730464684
In its present form, the report will contribute to further liberalisation of the capital markets, in spite of the fact that what is most important is to restrain them.	0.9320332578405962
Like the whole of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I have therefore voted against the proposal to amend Directive No 1 and have abstained from voting on the proposal to amend Directive No 2.	0.8663755099661281
Brok report (A5-0029/2000)	0.2017956254120384
Madam President, there has recently been much talk of the importance of enlarging the European Union.	0.8816747015680955
We have before us Malta and Cyprus, which are two States keen to become members.	0.7131505842855524
Given that the complexity of the procedures has been greatly reduced, I voted in favour not only because this measure addresses the need for cohesion between these applicant States and the Union, but also because I believe that this should be taken as an invitation from Parliament to the Council and the Commission to ensure that Cyprus and Malta become fully-fledged members of the European Union as swiftly as possible.	1.0214575014788398
.	-0.0
(FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta, whose accession is vital to the future of the European Union in the Mediterranean.	0.8281673814450696
The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for Cyprus and Malta, starting in the year 2000 and lasting for five years (2000-2004).	0.7977114507704617
The proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire.	0.4747936073216907
This new move follows on from the step taken at the Helsinki European Council last December, when it was decided that Malta had made sufficient progress to warrant opening bilateral conferences in February 2000, i.e. by the end of this month, in order to commence negotiations on the conditions of accession to the Union and the adjustments required.	0.8056702635087171
As far as Cyprus is concerned, although the Council stated that a political settlement would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. It also stated that its decision on accession would be made without the above being a precondition, which I welcome.	0.871793470062811
I have, in fact, always thought that insisting on a settlement of the present situation, in which one-third of this republic' s territory is occupied by Turkey, before starting negotiations with Cyprus was quite unfair.	0.8190928598795633
On a more general note, it is true that the socio-economic situation in these two countries is far better than in other candidate countries.	0.812986417336684
However, they have received technical assistance and financial aid from the European Union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire.	0.9569793932398428
Until 1999, this technical assistance and financial aid was provided under the fourth financial protocols (B7-4011).	0.595030676702334
Both countries also qualify for financial aid under the MEDA programme (B7-4012).	0.43282074342907634
During the first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament stressed that the new 'pre-accession' heading (B7-0), proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget, should not be limited to the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe and should also be extended to Malta and Cyprus.	0.8868398978408069
However, because of the Council' s refusal to negotiate a review of the ceiling set for heading 7 (pre-accession) in the Financial Perspectives, the European Parliament agreed, by way of exception, and I stress that it was by way of exception, that this expenditure should be financed under heading 4 (external action) of the Financial Perspectives for the year 2000.	1.0116920977794328
At the same time, the European Parliament created a new heading: 'pre-accession strategy for Mediterranean countries' (B7-04), under which two new articles were created for the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus pending the Commission' s presentation, following the Helsinki European Council, of the necessary legal bases and a review of the ceiling for heading 7 of the Financial Perspectives.	0.8035033560875117
This proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases!	0.791087631839611
. I welcome Mr Brok' s report supporting with amendments the Commission' s proposals seeking to prepare Cyprus and Malta for EU membership.	0.8070824436141509
The package will grant around Euro 15 million in total for the two countries in the current year.	0.6349078641741158
It is, however, regrettable that the Commission has eschewed multiannual financing and decided instead to allocate funds on a yearly basis.	0.5860745538851657
This is bound to have an impact on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan spending.	0.6678463665056823
The funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the Community 'acquis' .	0.8102669768463063
Given the already advanced state of these two countries, compared to other applicants, this should easily allow them to be 'technically and administratively' ready for membership at the end of the 5-year programme.	0.7712115193207609
Cederschiöld report (A5-0020/2000)	0.19858582841935316
.	-0.0
(FR) As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the last parliamentary term, I welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increasing protection for our single currency.	0.8057800057296264
The Union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting.	0.4793503475430923
Consumers and traders are still not familiar with the euro and it would be easy for counterfeit money to be passed in supermarkets, bureaux de change and banks and not be noticed straight away.	0.6349164407886597
And the fact that coins are to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify.	0.5789408448211383
The European information centres, which are already playing a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency, should step up their campaigns to raise public awareness of counterfeiting.	0.7754588319173532
On another level, we must ensure that Community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting.	0.7228370439397741
As far as criminal sanctions are concerned, measures are needed to guarantee protection for the euro from the outset and this is the purpose of the draft framework decision on increasing protection by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting presented by the European Parliament.	0.8485472441158483
The purpose of the framework decision is to supplement the provisions of the International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency of 20 April 1929 and to facilitate its application by the Member States.	0.6969926135383204
Each Member State must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable.	1.0001645868390583
These offences must be punishable even if they relate to banknotes and coins denominated in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 January 2002.	0.4818909722600306
This is a basic element of the decision.	0.9316230653788049
I cannot but support the rapporteur in deploring the fact that the present national currencies from which the euro is to take over are not protected.	0.8079704899607407
We must bear in mind that national currencies could continue to change hands for another 20 years!	0.42070348498884447
They should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation.	0.5719401864691384
It would also appear to be in the Union' s interest for all Member States to help protect the euro, especially Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Greece, which will not be introducing the euro on 1 January 2002.	1.0480891628042002
Although this framework decision is a step in the right direction, it confines itself to increasing criminal sanctions by harmonising substantive criminal law in the form of minimum standards.	0.6844565612202959
There is still no uniform criminal legislation on counterfeiting and there are 15 different national systems.	0.6342853909909753
That brings us back to the more general need to approximate criminal law called for by the European Council in Tampere.	0.7788467427973828
.	-0.0
(DA) Mrs Cederschiöld' s report reflects an extremely peculiar form of logic. The EU introduces a common currency.	0.802290215975106
The risk of counterfeiting increases. Counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire EU; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State.	0.7585841584697488
The harmonisation of criminal law or the introduction of minimum legal standards should not be legitimised against the background of problems of one' s own creation but from considerations of reason and necessity.	0.5856809610064975
There is nothing to indicate that the Member States' legal principles, legal traditions and carefully tailored legal systems should be lost for reasons to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeiting. Nor, in the light of the international convention of 20 April 1929, can there be any confusion as to which country should deal with any criminal cases.	0.7271958455882381
We are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the abandonment of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such flimsy grounds. Instead, the focus should be upon preventing the real problem.	0.7489086244428603

Di Pietro report (A5-0019/2000)	0.24375598086882289
Madam President, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party, there have been many occasions on which I have stated, at the committee stage, that the European Union must intervene in regulating the lives of the elderly, and in the measures and rules on pensions, as is already the case, in coordination.	1.0428795623915523
Similarly, as concerns the field of justice and criminal law, which we have discussed today, I believe not only that the different criminal law, juridical and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated, but also that we must at last formulate common standards: an offence committed in Italy must also be viewed as an offence in Great Britain, Spain or elsewhere.	0.9553728399565269
I believe that we, the Parliament of the European Union, who are the elected representatives of the citizens, must give sharper impetus to ensuring that the European Union provides for the regulation of every facet of the lives of its citizens, including that of justice, and that of pensions.	1.0684247516498462

We vote against this report, because by allowing trans-border interception of telecommunication and reversing the burden of proof, the Convention will create the legal ground for large scale bugging operations in the EU.	0.7101228575621887
That means, making a European bugging system like the transatlantic spying operation 'Echelon' perfectly legal.	0.46925055907336216
This Convention will lead to gross abuses of people' s rights to privacy.	0.6190311082983637

Also the following points are unacceptable for us: joint investigation teams, controlled deliveries, undercover investigations, inaccuracy of the text on the scope of the convention, lack of respect of the principle of proportionality, lack of democratic guarantees.	0.6596956915251913

(FR) In its communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, the Commission repeats that Europe needs to become a 'global actor' capable of speaking with a strong voice in the world.	0.735374294245751
What should this global actor' s objective be?	0.5062982930498607
Doubtless our citizens would say something along the lines of 'to defend the countries of Europe better' , since that is the traditional and primordial purpose of political associations.	0.7090260031963483
And yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen.	0.4120551118398466
All we find are vague phrases about 'strategic partnerships' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of Europe would apparently bring with it.	0.5579748505629731
The omission of this principal objective is highly revealing.	0.3314096557017777
It demonstrates one of the main flaws in the European Union, a little-known, almost always implicit flaw, but one which goes a long way towards explaining our citizens' loss of interest.	0.8966217104167764
There is a highly revealing passage on this point in the work programme for the year 2000 attached to the strategic guidelines.	1.0009722658062392
Addressing the fundamental question of relations with the United States, the Commission mentions just one priority: 'we will endeavour to reduce and eliminate as far as possible the disputes in transatlantic trade' (page 4).	0.7758789432618666
While we are on the subject, where one would expect a firm declaration of intent to defend European interests in the numerous trade conflicts under way, one merely finds the desire to eliminate conflict, which hardly sounds like determination on the part of the Commission to fight its corner.	0.8055647139686043
How strange that the Commission should lose its instinct for self-preservation just as Europe is integrating.	0.6074206257003181
I think there are three reasons for this: 1) in their endeavour to transcend the nation states, the European institutions have lost touch with the people and, in losing touch with the people, they have become putty in the hands of foreign interests; 2) having lost touch with the people, the men and women working in these institutions have started to become used to reasoning not as the sole champions of the people, but as international officials in charge of regulating a global system; 3) integration may afford economies of scale and productivity gains; but it also causes far more to be lost because, when it breaks nations, it breaks subtle expressions of solidarity and, with them, the willingness to present a united front.	0.9328743002339849
. (FR) I share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction expressed during the debate.	0.5682485632392047
I do, of course, understand the constraints of the moment and I am prepared to entertain the idea of the risk of failure....	0.7902362505961793
However, experience has taught me that, in politics, modest ambitions are never the key to success!	0.748016451712989
I shall not keep saying that I am disappointed, because you need to hope in order to be disappointed.... and I have had no hope since the investiture debate.	1.0788868601787072
As for the future, given that the Commission has shown itself incapable of taking action against fascism in Austria, I am convinced that blocking measures to liberalise the single market is the only way of administering a salutary electric shock treatment to the heart of all the countries in the Union.	0.8970195130287062
- (IT) On behalf of the Italian Communists, I would like to express great dissatisfaction at the contents of the document, which was expected to define the strategic guidelines for Europe up until the year 2005.	0.8692099164585307
Employment: for many years now, the connection between economic growth and an increase in employment has not been borne out by reality, and yet, despite the fact that it has been proved to be useless, the same recipe is being put forward again as a solution to the acute problem of unemployment.	0.9485800240853401
And yet our President is a fine economist.	0.45147262841663655
Pensions: The document states that, 'Member States must remain responsible for modernising social protection systems' , and yet the Commission itself intervened in the case of Italy, repeatedly calling for swift changes to the pension system to reduce rights and decrease pension payments.	0.8061485919037501
And yet President Prodi himself gave firm guidance to the Italian Government during those years and is therefore aware of the nature and extent of the sacrifices demanded of our fellow citizens and which they made in order to sign up to the euro, and he is aware of the major role played by Italy in European development.	0.7679948554668075
