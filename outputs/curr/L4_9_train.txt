As a final result an unscientific era comes about, on which Karl Jaspers commented in 1945 that only this unscientific spirit had made National Socialism possible.	0.4148415428231509
Based on the good statistical results of German obstetrics compared to those of foreign countries, it is shown that our patients' demands for "gentle" obstetrics can be combined with the requirements of safe obstetrics.	0.6543424305139791
If the professional interests of doctors and midwives are joint together, "safe and gentle" obstetrics should result in the common goal of a healthy child and a happy mother.	0.5972506561576281
Objectives: Due to its unique pharmacokinetics, the new esterase-metabolised opioid remifentanil results in rapid post-anaesthesia recovery.	0.5409744498424327
The aim of this clinical investigation was to compare recovery times after remifentanil anaesthesia in combination with hypnotic concentrations of either propofol or isoflurane.	0.6736938407788129
Dosages used in the study protocol were based on recommendations by the pharmaceutical manufacturer.	0.7029981086123915
Methods: Patients (ASA status I-II) scheduled for elective arthroscopy were included in this trial.	0.6620034629860546
Without premedication in the morning, anaesthesia was induced identically in both groups: remifentanil bolus (1 µg/kg), start of remifentanil-infusion (0.5 µg/kg/min), followed immediately by propofol (ca.	0.677720507705553
For maintenance of anaesthesia remifentanil (0.25 µg/kg/min) was combined with either a propofol infusion of 0.1 mg/kg/min or 0.5 MAC isoflurane (=0.6 vol.%) in O2/air.	0.7306736269074446
Anaesthetic delivery was discontinued simultaneously with termination of surgery and recovery times were recorded.	0.4855761226106978
Results: A total of 40 patients were studied at random in two groups of 20 each with comparable demographic data and anaesthetic technique (Tables 1 and 2).	0.6533668434861388
In both groups emergence was very rapid.	0.5730548771495282
Recovery times were significantly shorter for remifentanil-isoflurane than for remifentanil-propofol (Table 3): spontaneous ventilation 5.1 vs 8.1 min (P<0.05), extubation 5.5 vs. 8.6 min (P<0.02), post-anaesthesia recovery score >=9 of 10 points 6.2 vs 11.3 min (P<0.01), and arrival at PACU 16.2 vs 19.2 min (P<0.01).	0.6532954201544432
Mild to moderate shivering was noted in 40% of all patients (9 cases following isoflurane, 7 following propofol).	0.7706245457873865
Conclusions: Using the manufacturer's recommended dosages, emergence after remifentanil anaesthesia is more rapid with 0.5 MAC isoflurane than with 0.1 mg/kg/min propofol.	0.7087154027001641
These results are most probably due to the different pharmacological properties of both co-anaesthetics, especially the applied dosages, and to different interactions with remifentanil.	0.8507063380573809
Present clinical experience suggests that a further dose reduction, especially for propofol, is possible.	0.8107517796950903
For both remifentanil groups emergence was remarkably rapid between return of consciousness and the awake state (on-off phenomenon), which might contribute to post-anaesthesia safety.	0.5983456660075859
Exposure of the skin to ultraviolet irradiation is an important risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma, with UVA possibly playing an important role.	0.8701340516637132

Frequent and non-random changes in certain chromosomes have been demonstrated in melanoma cells.	0.46940519883752174
These might contain sequences that control melanoma growth or melanoma suppressor genes.	0.23255079208196383
Especially the short arm of chromosome 9 is thought to contain one of these genes.	0.6114416429050744
This hypothesis is supported by a genetic linkage analysis in melanoma families and the demonstration of a germ line deletion of the locus 9p21 in a patient with eight primary melanomas.	0.6324524476820157
Changes in known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes have also been reported in melanoma, but no consistent sequence of genetic events is known.	0.6594208755422094
Neuropsychological studies could demonstrate increased risk for impaired attention and short term memory as well as a general reduced information processing speed in childhood's epilepsy.	0.5248931830102572
Up to now it is not totally understood if focal EEG-pathology represents a specific cognitive deficit strongly related to the corresponding hemisphere's functions or represents a less lateralized but more general cognitive deficit of both cerebral hemispheres.	0.5366912623787528
In a sample of 44 pediatric patients with epilepsy we studied sequential and simultaneous cognitive information processing.	0.3686935002427456
As a major result a general decreased function in cognitive information processing (more sequential than simultaneous) has been found.	0.5569887373563333
There was no correlation with the localization of an EEG-Focus nor with the hand preference.	0.6169625663665036
According to previous studies patients with an increased number of medical drugs or with presence of neuroradiological lesions are at greatest risk for cognitive impairment.	0.5530353869169766

The aim of this prospective and randomized study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reduced shock strength in transvenous implantable defibrillator therapy.	0.7481037685368517
So far clinical data concerning the safety margin of the shock energy in ICD therapy do not exist.	0.49277587263129885
The shock energy tested during long-term follow-up in this study was twice the intraoperatively measured defibrillation threshold (DFT).	0.672525008375249
A total number of 176 consecutive patients representing a typical cohort of ICD patients were evaluated.	0.49515984964883514
All patients received a non-thoracotomy lead system (CPI, Endotak 0070, 0090) and a biphasic cardioverter-defibrillator with the ability to store episodes (Cardiac Pacemakers Inc., Ventac TM PRx II, PRx III).	0.5473259928511276
The intraoperative defibrillation threshold (DFT) was evaluated in a step-down protocol (15, 10, 8, 5 J) and hat to be <=15 J for inclusion into the study.	0.7750287380940591
The lowest effective energy terminating induced ventricular fibrillation had to be confirmed and was defined as DFT+ augmented defibrillation threshold.	0.5101197286327666
The DFT+ value was tested immediately after successful implantation, at discharge, and after a follow-up period of one year.	0.8282845465735886
Prior to implantation the patients were randomized into two groups.	0.6553450390131178
The energy of the first shock in the study group was programmed at twice DFT+ and in the control group at the maximum energy output (34 J).	0.8084770761715553
The efficacy of the first shock and its reproducibility in DFT testings and in spontaneous episodes during long-term follow-up of the study group were compared to those in the control group.	0.8830623981521543
A DFT+ value was found to be <=15 J in 166 of 176 patients (94%).	0.4477114237440544
The DFT+ in the study group was 9.6+/-3.2; in control group 10.1+/-.35 J.	0.7357859304936498
The prohability of successful defibrillation at DFT+ level after one year was 84%.	0.32385530735662094
The success rate of the first shock meant to terminate induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 99.5% in the study group (217 of 218 episodes) and 99% in the control group (201 of 203 episodes).	0.8145049816578912
During follow-up of 24+/-9 months spontaneous episodes in the study group, 83/86 (96.5) monomorphic ventricular tachycardias (MVT) and 38/40 (95%) VF-episodes were converted successfully by the 2x DFT+ shock.	0.6739102786193247
In the control group the first shock was successful in 151/156 (96.8%) spontaneous MVTs and in 30/33 (91%) VF episodes.	0.7031059236829423
The efficacy of the first shock was not influenced by clinical data such as the underlying cardiac disease, left ventricular function, ongoing antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone, or the number of spontaneous episodes per day or by the DFT itself.	0.7893724099030542
At a mean follow-up of two years there was no significant difference between the two groups concerning the incidence of sudden cardiac death (2.4% in the study group vs. 3.8% in the control group).	0.9867773843398818
In conclusion programming the first shock with the ICD lead system used in this study at 2x DFT+ is as efficient as a shock energy of 34 J in order to terminate induced and spontaneous episodes of VT/VF.	0.5575452859844803
Thus, the safety of ICD-therapy is not impaired when programming the shock energy at the 2x DFT+ value.	0.6662503610880052
Culpable deficits of the preoperative information cause a complete illegality of the whole medical intervention and lead to liability for any resulting damage.	0.5589481847393108
In cases of controversy it's the physician's due to prove the correct preoperative information.	0.5567050259793325
To reduce these liability-risks a computer based information system has been developed.	0.47959945983865726
With its help an working sheet is provided which is individually adjusted for the patient.	0.3469940349370497
Based upon this record the real preoperative information takes place.	0.31486505697163697
After the patient signed the record the physician keeps it at his disposal for proving the contents of the preoperative information.	0.47271848992143645
The conception's use over many years shows that overlooking essential aspects and misunderstanding can grossly be excluded for the patient and a high quality of information can be reached.	0.6278884084652091
In vitro culture of peritoneal explants of neonatal rats after previous application of agents simulating wound antisepsis is a sensitive screening method for the determination of the tissue compatibility of local wound antiinfectives.	0.5667683450246137
Two test models are differentiated: (1) separated peritoneal explants as a model for chronic or deep wounds and (2) peritoneum in situ in the experimental animal with subsequent extraction and cultivation of the explants.	0.5093367187932514
Considering the present state of knowledge the following conclusions can be drawn regarding antisepsis of wounds: Lavasept (0.1 %) may be classified as the agent of choice for deep and chronic wounds, for drip-suck irrigation and for antiinfective lavage of body cavities inclusively for peritoneal lavage (0,05 %).	0.653216185091666
Taurolidin is antiseptically effective in long term application ( > 6 h), and because of its antitoxic effect as well as lack of cytotoxicity it is especially suitable for peritoneal lavage.	0.6720802137690498
Betaisodona solution is very well suited for superficial contaminated wounds and can be used in a dilution of 1 : 10 for short-term rinsing of deep wounds, including body cavities but not for peritoneal lavage.	0.7402463513376514
Ethanol causes no inhibition of explant growth and therefore retains its importance in wound antisepsis.	0.35855942902899485

Death may occur while a fleeing or resisting suspect is taken into custody by the police.	0.3483144413144912
We report about this type of acute death in two males.	0.6262468967303777
In both cases, a cocaine intoxication was taken as the cause of death despite an initial suspicion of a direct association between the death and police measures (e.g.	0.580998675615169
neck compression or "headlock", chest compression).	0.45527590043180904
From the Institute's autopsy material we selected another 12 cases with monointoxication by cocaine as the cause of death of as a secondary finding for comparison.	0.44136267445839605
Of the 12 cases 5 were gunshot injuries and 4 were classified as suicide.	0.45622465691551967
The analysis suggested an increased willingness to apply force against themselves or others under the influence of cocaine.	0.33647507009452565
In both cases, cardiac arrest occurred suddenly and unexpectedly for all those involved and who were unaware of any acute life-threatening situation because of the extreme attempts of the suspects to flee or resist arrest.	0.5356956567206433

Non-traumatic duodenocaval fistulae are rare, but may be the source of massive gastrointestional bleeding with associated fever and sepsis.	0.6537570814291837
These fistulae result from penetrating duodenal peptic ulcers or right nephrectomy and subsequent radiation to the upper abdomen.	0.36659040342881444
The outcome depends on early diagnosis and surgery before a potentially fatal hemorrhage occurs.	0.5228318502120014
The therapy of choice includes closure of the fistula and repair of the duodenum and inferior vena cava.	0.6260326375824432

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is rare but beset with a high mortality rate.	0.6234253714746518
In recent years, however, a trend towards higher survival rates has been observed.	0.5085690380395728
High inspiratory oxygen concentrations, large tidal volumes, and high peak inspiratory airway pressures applied during mechanical ventilation have been identified as harmful to the lung and can contribute to the progression of ARDS.	0.6722749034290809
This had led to reconsideration of the sequelae of ventilatory therapy.	0.32179718418620384
Mechanical ventilation and other adjunctive strategies in ARDS have changed from the conventional approach aiming at normalisation of physiological ventilatory parameters to an elaborated approach that intends to protect the ventilated lung, prevent oxygen toxicity, recruit the infiltrated atelectatic and consolidated lung and reduce the anatomical and alveolar dead space.	0.4333094446566374
This new approach consists of various forms of pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation with PEEP and permissive hypercapnia, body position changes, and inhalation of nitric oxide.	0.5801630659801194
Should these procedures fail to improve impaired gas exchange, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an additional therapeutic option.	0.42449904854934317

After an average of 11 weeks' follow-up, full recovery from the preoperative pain and neurological deficits could be seen in 6 of the patients.	0.6921876667382174
The confusion of scientific, economic, juridical and professional contexts is the reason for the present uneasiness within therapeutic culture.	0.523987985598863
The author pleads for autonomy of these contexts to defend the profession reasonably against powerful overdetermination by other contexts.	0.30219926806018976
The debate about EST ("empirically supported therapy") is being drawn upon to show that the list of criteria for differentiation of effective and ineffective therapies is not warranted.	0.6429860733047293
Scientific or economic dominance claims might have deteriorating effects in the professional fields, as well-known researchers meanwhile fear.	0.6383279333165792
In economic contexts the aim is efficiency, in professional contexts it is quality.	0.5782254778907522
To develop own quality measures has the aim to promote the profession as a learning organization.	0.4176717273574504
This could help to rise professionals' self-confidence.	0.29668254147388484
Procalcitonin is the propeptide of calcitonin devoid of hormonal activity.	0.28197866294044005
Normally, procalcitonin is produced in the C-cells of the thyroid gland.	0.42141449981924695
In healthy humans procalcitonin levels are undetectable (<0.1 ng/ml).	0.6899910655707814
During severe generalized infections (bacterial, parasitic and fungal) with systemic manifestations, procalcitonin levels may rise up to 100 ng/ml.	0.5932451712507731
In contrast, severe viral infections or inflammatory reactions of non-infectious origin do not or very moderately increase procalcitonin levels.	0.568870834368893
The exact site of procalcitonin production is not exactly known but even large amounts of procalcitonin released during infections do not lead to an increase in plasma calcitonin level or activity.	0.46102960741752774
In this retrospective study, oncologic and functional results of 24 patients treated for glomus jugulare tumor stages C and D are reported.	0.5990158028733397
The surgical approach used was a combined transmastoid-transcervical approach, which was modified according to individual tumor growth.	0.7025503603337335
As needed, this was combined with a transtemporal or retrosigmoid approach.	0.6958080233412615
Complete tumor removal resulted in a cure rate of 100%.	0.5252508689141778
Surgically induced cranial nerve palsies developed in 38% of the patients.	0.5162594416734407

Radical tumor removal was modified by efforts to reduce mutilating resections.	0.32829120509880605
These results show that individually tailored and combined multidirectional surgical approaches can allow total tumor removal to be performed with lower morbidity.	0.5661423774325839
Electron beam CT, which does not require mechanical movement of an X-ray tube, has a temporal resolution which exceeds that of conventional computed tomography by a factor of about ten.	0.6553773312445275
Axial images of the heart can be acquired within 50 to 100 ms with a spatial resolution below 0.5 mm2 and permit precise visualization of all cardiac structures.	0.5736323318768461
ECG-triggered acquisition of 30 to 40 axial images (3 mm slice thickness) in a short inspiratory breathhold allows one to sample a 3-dimensional volume data set which covers the complete heart.	0.6661951338621281
Overall acquisition times are approximately 30 to 50 seconds.	0.3046710109919816
While electron beam CT in general permits a complete cardiac investigation, including morphology, function, and perfusion, the method's most important application is non-invasive imaging of the coronary arteries.	0.7064704489846244
Without contrast enhancement, coronary calcification by EBCT currently constitutes the most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence even of very early forms of coronary atherosclerosis.	0.5428027642134888
Intraveneous injection of contrast agent during image acquisition additionally permits the selective visualization of the coronary artery lumen and detection of significant stenoses.	0.5484353802098814
This method is especially well suited in the follow-up of coronary interventions and coronary bypass grafting.	0.6396653715411436
Breathhold and movement artifacts, superposition of coronary arteries and veins, as well as severe coronary calcifications currently constitute the method's main problems.	0.48888514337086886
In spite of these limitations, electron beam CT has been shown to permit clinically valuable non-invasive investigations of the coronary arteries, which may be further refined as technology progresses.	0.7018203436236614
Despite the availability of diagnostic modalities such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging up to 30% of patients with acute aortic dissection remain undiagnosed before death.	0.6293521798423403
A novel immunoassay of serum smooth muscle myosin as a potential diagnostic tool for the detection of aortic dissection.	0.5696106390592476
The immunoassay was applied in two patients with an acute chest pain syndrome but no initial suspicion of aortic disease.	0.7340539149799253
In both patients myocardial ischemia was ruled out by laboratory, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examination.	0.48861429828247926
In the first patient both dilation of the aortas and long-standing arterial hypertension were known; however, it was not before 48h until dissection was suspected and a spiral-CT was performed demonstrating a localized ascending aortic dissection.	0.665399933344897
At this time (48 h after onset of symptoms) the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain concentration in the serum was close to normal.	0.7186020815356394
In the other patient there was neither a suggestive history nor any clinical sign of aortic dissection.	0.5362393212842971
Widening of the abdominal was the key to the incidental diagnosis of a clinically unsuspected type B dissection.	0.6603803236858397
The serum test 12 h after onset of pain revealed elevated (diagnostic) serum levels of smooth muscle myosin heavy chains.	0.48432618525919396
Recurrent abdominal pain is found in 10-25% of school-aged children, thus being one of the most frequent complaints in childhood.	0.7569688477229988
Despite that, our knowledge about this syndrome is still very incomplete.	0.6690517639570962
Following oral surgery, there are sometimes disturbances in wound healing.	0.6450321100631656
It was the aim of this investigation to look for relationships between the composition of saliva and disturbed wound healing.	0.6062092393368463
Resting as well as stimulated fasting whole saliva was collected from 96 patients (19 to 53 years of age) prior to oral surgery.	0.5452504311866178
Flow rate, pH, standard bicarbonate, total buffer bases, peroxidase, lysozyme, thiocyanate, secretory immunoglobulin A, lactoferrin, total protein, tissue type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor were determined.	0.5190118897111935
The salivary data of eight patients who suffered from disturbed wound healing were compared to the data of 20 randomly selected patients with normal wound healing.	0.738184846343067
Patients with disturbed wound healing revealed increased activities and secretion rates for peroxidase in resting saliva.	0.34973113985225934
In stimulated saliva, decreased secretion rates for thiocyanate and total protein were found.	0.39915963195057497
Not a single salivary factor was able to discriminate both groups of patients with sufficient accuracy, but with a combination of tissue type plasminogen activator, peroxidase, plus secretory immunoglobulin A measurements from resting whole saliva a clearly improved and acceptable discrimination of the two patient groups was possible.	0.572620667615794
A discriminant function including six salivary factors could be used to completely separate both groups.	0.4531527387965955
Nuclear imaging methods provide noninvasive indexes of myocardial function, perfusion, and metabolism and are well accepted in clinical cardiology.	0.6247237206883959
Advances in prevention and treatment of cardiac disease have resulted in decreasing cardiovascular mortality in industrialized nations.	0.5298132638069644
The improvement in therapeutic options has increased the demand for diagnostic tests that might guide clinical decision making.	0.4532502115159203
Information beyond the pure anatomic characterization of coronary stenoses is required.	0.36596458254562986
Nuclear imaging can be used for early detection and monitoring of the severity and extent of disease.	0.8870695258157792
The prognostic potential of such functional testing is being increasingly appreciated and used to guide therapy, thereby resulting in improvement of the quality and cost-effectiveness of the workup of patients with cardiovascular disease.	0.7556544150298614
Extensive clinical validation has resulted in growing acceptance of these techniques.	0.5060050746287558
Furthermore, ongoing improvement of imaging techniques and development of new radiopharmaceuticals will pave the way for disease-specific, molecular-targeted cardiac imaging in the future.	0.6593331669172826
Epidural anaesthesia for elective caesarean section can have advantages over general anaesthesia.	0.37980142753545115
The anaesthesiologist can avoid endotracheal intubation as well as fetal depression following placental transfer of systemic anaesthetics.	0.3994216501351281
However, despite reaching an effective blockade preoperatively, intraoperative discomfort and pain may occur during epidural anaesthesia with local anaesthetics alone, necessitating supplemental systemic analgesics or even conversion to general anaesthesia [21].	0.5699119001458826
Addition of epidural fentanyl has been shown to improve onset and quality of perioperative analgesia without evident side effects for mother or newborn [24].	0.5029506317508544
Nevertheless, administration of epidural opioids before cord clamping is still hotly debated, some fearing maternal and or neonatal depression [6, 26].	0.5687447485813081
The aim of the present study was to investigate the quality of analgesia, associated side effects and the resulting maternal and neonatal plasma opiate concentrations after a single preoperative addition of 0.1 mg fentanyl to epidural bupivacaine analgesia in comparison to epidural bupivacaine analgesia alone.	0.7285306881569776
The quality of the morphological analysis of myocardial and coronary alterations depends essentially on the method chosen for the heart dissection.	0.5328145167843599
Even if previous postmortem coronary angioplasty is not feasible, the best results are obtained by transverse sectioning of the ventricles in a bread-loaf fashion subsequent to formalin-fixation and serial cross-sectioning of the coronary arteries, with decalcification in addition if necessary.	0.6053721595503433
The distribution pattern of disseminated myocardial necrosis, the longitudinal, circumferential and transmural extent of infarction, its age and sequelae and its correlation to the coronary supplying areas can be evaluated with better accuracy than by dissecting the heart chambers according to the flow of blood.	0.6499604950546463
Cross-sectioning of coronary arteries with preservation of their luminal shape allows proper examination of the degree and extent of luminal narrowing, plaque hemorrhage, parietal and occluding thrombi and the effects and complications of angioplastic procedures or bypass surgery.	0.5527537773504199
Transverse sectioning of the heart is a prerequisite for adequate examination following sudden cardiac death and short-term territorial ischemia.	0.6350301889052682
Full-thickness samples of the ventricular walls, taken systematically with respect to coronary narrowing and coronary supplying areas, enable identification of early myocardial damage.	0.5614754989311604
Total hip replacement is one of the most successful procedures in surgery.	0.7808860221737759
In Germany there is a great variety of cemented and uncemented implants with different principles of fixation.	0.577308028173636
We reviewed the different principles, with particular reference to long-term clinical outcome, and discuss the most popular systems available in Germany.	0.6845603213991349
Despite many new developments which have been made in the field of cementless hip replacement, cemented total hip arthroplasty will remain the "gold standard" until prospective long-term data (>15 years) of cementless systems become available.	0.6585245701591508
To summarize current knowledge on surgical therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis).	0.5014329588928315
Procalcitonin is a propeptide of calcitonin.	0.25787363173512307
It is usually not detectable in healthy volunteers but appears in high concentrations in the serum of patients with severe bacterial, parasitic or fungal infection.	0.7002163835617221
In contrast, procalcitonin levels do not or only moderately increase during viral infections or during non-infectious systemic inflammatory states.	0.5614398335040839
Because of these properties, procalcitonin has been proposed to serve as a marker of severe infections and sepsis.	0.7408285282426464
Increased procalcitonin levels have recently been shown to indicate the severity of systemic infection with increasing specificity.	0.5982383923890846
Normally, procalcitonin is produced in the C-cells of the thyroid gland.	0.42141449981924695
The origin of the high levels of procalcitonin in septic conditions is not fully understood.	0.5765788292608399
Although procalcitonin has drawn attention as a marker of severe systemic infections, a recent study suggests it may also be a mediator of sepsis.	0.6371607687146641
More studies are needed to uncover the nature and pathophysiological role of this molecule.	0.44639606671929305
Fractures of the hand sceleton are common injuries.	0.621713358788512
These are or are associated with phalangeal fractures.	0.3763874006244104
Kirschner wires can be used for osteosynthesis, but can cause lesions of periphereal finger structures.	0.7532768905974367
The aim of our study was to record the incidence of lesions in peripherial structures of the fingers caused by retrograde crossed inserted Kirschner wires of 1.0, 1.25, 1.4 and 1.6 mm diameter into the middle and proximal phalanges of the long fingers and the proximal phalanx of the thumb of 120 fresh cadaver hands.	0.8827858802207783
We found an increase of insertion attempt frequency and an increasing number of lesions with increasing Kirschner wire diameter.	0.5658313439513429
Because of these findings Kirschner wires of 1.0 or 1.25 mm diameter should be prefered to prevent the periphereal functional finger structures.	0.656360819791892
Fucosidosis, a rare lysosomal storage disease due to nearly complete deficiency of -L- fucosidase, was diagnosed in two unrelated male German patients who exhibited typical symptoms of this disorder including mental retardation, dysostosis multiplex, vacuolization of lymphocytes and progressive neurologic deterioration by the age of 3.2 and 4 years, respectively.	0.6896772425328026
In both cases, activity of -L-fucosidase in leukocytes and cultivated fibroblasts was negligible.	0.5195947193012966
DNA analysis revealed a nonsense mutation (G401X) in exon 7 of the fucosidase gene; this leads to a premature stop codon and C-terminal deletion of 61 amino acids from the protein.	0.5541670049537719
Discussion: On account of the mutation a unique PFlMI restriction site is obliterated; this simplifies molecular diagnosis of the G401X mutation.	0.526084578652351
So far, the mutation G401X has not been found in any other population.	0.6592159851423132
The main reason for posttraumatic secondary brain damage is cerebral hypoxia.	0.39808033536301063
Both, severity and duration of hypoxia are crucial in determining wether irreversible cerebral infarction will occur or not.	0.4288453809822751
For the clinical routine, the diagnosis of hypoxia is indirectly made by low CPP, low jugularvenous oxygen saturation (SjO2) or low tissue PO2.	0.6586179612028323
To minimize misleading false negative SjO2, the CT-Approach for the side of monitorig and calculation of arterial-jugularvenous lactate content for detection of anaerobic metabolism is recommended.	0.5710489611192404
Targeted treatment of hypoxia according to the underlying cause is mandatory.	0.6268927923578295
Primary goal is to increase cellular oxygen delivery by correction of low arterial oxygen content and elevation of regional CBF.	0.511496921611332
Within the autoregulatory range decreasing CPP causes vasodilation and increasing CPP vasoconstriction with increasing or decreasing cerebral blood volume respectively.	0.3664858148323721
Initially elevation of the lower autoregulatory threshold often requires CPP 70 mmHg.	0.5265456025229956
Targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension must avoid decreasing CPP.	0.37006836390725745
In the early postrautmatic phase prevention of cerebral hypoxia relies on management of CBF by means of CPP and cerebral vascular resistance.	0.47505226466505024
Thereafter targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension caused by cerebral edema and hypervolemia are increasingly important.	0.40288561106454307
Today, orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for the end-stage of various liver diseases, and a 1-year survival rate of 80 % and a 5-year survival rate of 70 % in elective patients without tumor are reported in international surveys.	0.9924726238720798
The liver transplant programme of the Inselspital in Bern is small compared with international centres, which may raise questions about the results and the justification for such a programme.	0.657234176151124
Over a period of 66 months, 62 liver transplantations were performed in 60 patients at the Inselspital.	0.59966664404421
The hospital mortality was 3.3 %, and the 2.5-year overall survival rate was 92 % for elective cases without tumor.	1.0114277417604527
After a median follow-up of 30 months, 68 % of all patients were re-integrated in housework or full- or part-time in their profession, and 83 % were independent from the help of others.	0.8414165466692726
We conclude that a small liver transplant programme based only on routine resources can achieve results comparable to the international standards.	0.4804847383376455
Accidental hypothermia (AH) can be defined as an unintentional decrease in core temperature below 35  °C during cold exposure by individuals without intrinsic thermoregulatory dysfunction.	0.4516561292734113
Pathophysiological changes can be attributed both to the severity of hypothermia and to co-morbid factors such as trauma, submersion, intoxication and underlying diseases.	0.47823948127990323
In trauma victims stratified according to the Injury Severity Score, the factor hypothermia is considered to be a poor prognostic sign for survival.	0.6559369601593524
In these patients rewarming therapy should be applied as soon as possible.	0.6353158599490291
In the Utrecht University Hospital, adult patients with AH are managed according to an algorithm based on their presenting hemodynamic conditions.	0.5103314053467961
Patients with perfusing cardiac rhythms and systolic pressures over 80 mmHg will receive continuous arteriovenous rewarming (CAVR).	0.328663973515178
Arrested and hemodynamically instable patients are treated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	0.3701934397046383
In a 3-year period, 22 patients with AH were admitted to the emergency department.	0.8282138487264324
Fourteen patients had a trauma as the cause of hypothermia.	0.5624579655540259
Twenty patients were treated according to the algorithm (CAVR n = 18, CPB n = 2) and two patients were alternatively managed.	0.7961310155539854
Mortality in the CAVR group was 28 % and total mortality reached 32 %.	0.6748093514115517
Complications of CAVR are related to placement and removal of vascular catheters and may be severe in these patients with impaired coagulation.	0.624737668551339
CAVR permits a good access to the (trauma-) patient and rewarming can be continued synchronously with diagnosis and treatment of various injuries.	0.7031491799267973
The grading of long-tubular-bone pseudarthrosis depends on the biological reaction or lack of reaction in pseudarthrosis or non-unions.	0.5304316597221648
Hypertrophic and oligotrophic pseudarthrosis belongs to biologically reacting non-unions, whereas non-reacting non-unions are necrotic pseudarthrosis and defective non-unions with partial decline or complete destruction of cortical substance.	0.47044028146145256
Pseudarthrosis is a serious disturbance or disorder within the regulation cycle in fracture healing, which consists of osteoregeneration, osteovascularization and stabilization.	0.4638154921426423
The causes and underlying reasons for disturbance of this regulation cycle are primarily massive destruction of the biological and functional very important unity of periost, cortical substance and medullary space.	0.5164888468655299
This can occur from trauma, but it happens more often from surgical procedures that do not take the biological principles of bone-healing into account.	0.6999253688637892
Surgical strategies and interventions that respect the importance of periosteal tissue, cortical tissue and medullary space do fill the biological principles of fracture-healing and fracture union.	0.49132558072889393
Background: Clonidine, an 2-receptor agonist, has been reported to prolong the blocking actions of local anaesthetics.	0.7314186005004424
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of spinally injected clonidine on the duration of spinal anaesthesia by mepivacaine and on the postoperative demand for analgesics.	0.5817958027576892
Differentiation of an elevated, repeatedly determined platelet count (>=500x109/l) includes the discrimination between reactive causes generated by a variety of underlying conditions and a neoplastic myeloprolifera-tive disorder (CMPD).	0.5044083627643264
In addition to clinical findings, the evolution of laboratory data during follow-up and histology of the bone marrow exerts a significant diagnostic impact.	0.7714089603527567
Characteristic features are not only expressed by hematopoiesis, but also by the myeloid stromal compartment.	0.7368659043461534
While the megakaryocyte-rich subtype of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and the 5q- syndrome (MDS) are dominated by abnormal micromegakaryocytes, in polycythemia vera (PV) this cell lineage reveals a pleomorphous appearance.	0.5509551734742439
In essential thrombocythemia (ET), a prevalence of giant megakaryocytes with deeply lobulated (staghorn-like) nuclei may be encountered.	0.46373577857000636
A clear-cut discrimination of ET from early (hypercellular) stages of idiopathic (primary) myelofibrosis (IMF) presenting with thrombocythemia becomes possible, provided the conspicuous atypical features of megakaryopoiesis characterizing the latter entity are taken into account.	0.49058320085394325
Moreover, CML displays a predominance of the granulocytic lineage whereas PV shows a panmyelosis or trilineage proliferation, involving erythropoiesis, in particular.	0.5535959381755359
In contrast, erythropoiesis is markedly reduced in CML and to a lesser degree also in IMF.	0.509366288679321
In CMPDs extreme values of iron deposits may be found, ranging from a total lack (PV) to minor amounts (CML) and a normal staining reaction (ET).	0.6461759488117632
Similar results are exhibited regarding reticulin fibrosis, which is usually not present in ET, rarely observed in PV and detectable to a variable degree in CML and IMF.	0.5798397226199191
Nevus cell aggregates in lymph nodes are uncommon.	0.4829923083505834
This benign phenomenon may be difficult to differentiate from metastatic neoplasia.	0.48253336612213493
We report the case of a 56-year-old patient who underwent breast biopsy, followed by radical mastectomy including lymphadenectomy.	0.6313558155998953
Histological examination revealed solid cell aggregates as foreign tissue in the capsule of 1 of 11 identified lymph nodes devoid of any keratin immunoreaction.	0.45796697638197736
Strong immunohistological staining for the S-100 protein confirmed the diagnosis of nevus cell aggregates.	0.5543197255662252

Cramp-like abdominal pain and a subileus were the first symptoms.	0.5756692754533993
Enemas did not relieve the symptoms, and the following laparotomoy with Tenckhoff catheter explantation was performed which did not reveal any pathologic abnormalities.	0.5870966385133961
Two days after the beginning of abdominal pain an unspecific papular rash developed.	0.4917098911959418
Further twelve hours later skin vesicles appeared and varicella-zoster virus was isolated from their fluid.	0.35375692124031977
Despite high dose administration of aciclovir and varicella-zoster immune globulin further visceral dissemination occurred and finally lead to liver failure and intravascular coagulopathy.	0.34643823194282536
The patient died 18 days after kidney transplantation from multiorgan failure.	0.5459623321422995
The unconscious patient presents an challenging emergency in the intensive care unit.	0.2970743167562977
Patient evaluation and treatment must occur simultaneously.	0.2997301291699748
After checking vital signs, deciding about cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation, an intravenous line must be established, blood samples collected and glucose and thiamine should be given.	0.5506939407197806
The physical and neurological examination should be performed in a efficient way and must consider the following eight points: best reaction to loud commands, best motor reaction to noxious stimuli, respiratory pattern, size and reactions of pupils, eye movements, corneal and blink reflex, meningismus, muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes.	0.5468013834029011
With this approach it is possible to formulate a working diagnosis, and the appropriate diagnostic steps can be performed.	0.7406779034969996

In any atypical alcoholic delirium, especially with focal neurological signs, partial seizures, or decreased level of consciousness, CNS diseases like meningoencephalitis, intracranial hemorrhage, or central pontine myelinolysis must be diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) scan and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) tap.	0.6122646962012709
The diagnostic and prognostic value of CT scan and CSF analysis was examined in 32 persons with alcohol withdrawal syndrome or delirium tremens.	0.6036902666182709
Neurological complications and cerebral convulsions at the beginning of delirium tremens appear to predispose the patient to a protracted clinical course and necessary mechanical ventilation.	0.5557397178024431
Blood-CSF barrier permeability is increased in 70% of alcohol withdrawal patients and that also seems to be a marker of a prolonged clinical course.	0.6913199518572349
Cerebral atrophy as shown in CT scan does not play a role in predicting clinical course.	0.452361966124247
In our experience, CT examination or lumbar puncture is not necessarily recommended if clinical signs are typical for alcohol delirium.	0.5805826853181988
Recently, an implantable hearing aid for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss has been developed.	0.6380488849678089
One component of the device is the microphone for implantation into the posterior canal wall.	0.5503094259381075
The membrane of the microphone can be covered by skin, cartilage, or fascia, avoiding reduction in sound transmission at the same time.	0.5966776842664101
In the study presented here, the microphone was implanted into 50 cadaver specimens of human temporal bone.	0.71475360419903
Localization of the microphone was determined by the anatomical situation of the facial nerve.	0.8848120484337396
The microphone and the piezoelectric transducer could be implanted in 78% of the temporal bones after total mastoidectomy.	0.6999087377918826
In the final version of the microphone, the size was 4.5 mm and total weight 400 mg.	0.8877191896533604
Collagen vascular diseases, representing systemic soft tissue disorders, may cause a broad spectrum of pathologic changes of the respiratory tract.	0.7341238092474598
The type and extent of manifestations can vary considerably among individuals and entities.	0.4163850820478871
This survey describes the chest radiographic and, in particular, high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) findings of individual lesions of the respiratory tract.	0.694656535484491
It includes fibrosing alveolitis (alveolitis, interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis) and bronchial (bronchitis/bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis), pleural and vascular manifestations, as well as lymphadenopathy and abnormalities related to therapy.	0.4958257967758211
We present typical patterns of changes in progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS, scleroderma), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD, Sharp syndrome), Sjögren syndrome, overlap syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).	0.4633003767998372
Furthermore, we describe findings which are specific for individual entities such as esophageal involvement in PSS, acute pneumonitis and pulmonary hemorrhage in SLE, lymphoproliferative disease in Sjögren syndrome and necrobiotic nodules in RA.	0.5376352697110662
The psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders, or "hysterical" symptoms are increasingly understood as ways of coping with traumatic experiences in childhood or adolescence such as abuse or violence.	0.5992717266898854
Dissociation with induced depersonalisation, derealisation, and personification of objects as only good or only bad is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.	0.48421250800780563
Unassimilated memories of traumata have a retraumatizing effect and call for defence through eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harming behaviour, or social acting-out.	0.44698220095533475
Against this psychodynamic background we describe a method of trauma-therapy which uses experiences of hypnotherapy and of Guided affective Imagery.	0.48418483234698273
In the preparatory phase a secure inner space and contact to inner helpers are established in the imagination using a resource-oriented approach.	0.4360324641282618
The actual trauma-therapy consists of a gradual leading-up to the traumatic scenes through consistent, minimally retraumatizing confrontation, followed by consolation and the ability to let go.	0.5869688893082946
In the final phase there is a return to resource-oriented creativity and concrete life planning.	0.579200513120186
All patients of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Erfurt Hospital with odontogenic pyogenic infections have been analyzed in a retrospective study over a period of 10 years, from 1987 to 1997.	0.6031827522286815
This included questions concerning frequency, seriousness and treatment of these infections, social changes in the environ prove effects about the referral behaviour and the course.	0.6576582500742547
Odontogenic pyogenic infections are mixed infections.	0.2533837849998838
Aerobic agents such as hemolytic streptococcuses and staphylococcuses as well as anaerobic bacteria and  fungi can be involved.	0.3489732941385331
Cephalosporine, aminobenzylpenicillin in combination with -lactamase inhibitor, alcylaminopenicillin and lincosamide are recommended based on analysis of infection resistance as first choice medications with carbapeneme as a reserve antibiotic.	0.4096661367359692
Hospitals are competing with each other for the limited financial resources available in the health care sector.	0.4738517957329885
Comparison of hospitals is legally required (BPflV § 5) to improve financial efficiency in the health care sector and make competition between hospitals keener, while also objectivizing it.	0.5785897523846943
If comparison of the hospitals is really to enhance profitability or efficiency, and not just to reduce the prices for hospital stays regardless of quality, it must extend to far more than the global figures in the compilation summarizing performance and calculation and the hospital statistics (no.	0.6566770177077313
of cases, days of care, length of stay, case lump sums and special fees).	0.4896928642038214
Documentation of particular features of the patient population, the potentials of the hospital and description of the treatment processes yield valuable information on capacity and performance level.	0.821416217640598
With rising costs, the danger is growing that the quality and risk dimension of the actual medical treatment will not be promoted with the same enthusiasm by those offering the service.	0.6358087341777547
Hospital audit does not only allow a check on the hospital's own situation with regard to performance, quality, efficiency and patient satisfaction, but can also provide a basis for structural planning.	0.635069215962822
The fact is that all efforts made and steps taken by the responsible persons in the hospital to improve the quality of structures, processes and results can only be successful if they are also perceived by the patients, the doctors who refer them and the visitors.	0.6319870618959902
If hospital audit is restricted to the bed occupancy and the invoicing data, it is only realistic to expect cuts in performance level.	0.4729822485174942
This would be bad for the patient and, in view of the consequent costs, also for the overall costs in the health care sector.	0.8037109307767337
Against the backdrop of a future performance-related system of remuneration instead of the principle of covering one's own costs that has been in place hitherto, openness about treatment results gains in importance as a competition parameter for qualified hospitals.	0.4955154956362336
Laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in 120 patients scheduled to undergo either radical perineal prostatectomy or radiation therapy.	0.5570356309990697
On average 13 lymph nodes were resected in each patient, and 21 patients were found to have metastatic disease in 1-9 lymph nodes.	0.6798367745478723
After an initial learning curve, mean operative time was reduced significantly, allowing laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical prostatectomy to be performed as a one-stage procedure.	0.820495330232239
The overall complication rate was 10 %; open revisions were necessary in only 2 of 120 patients.	0.6063889023938434
Postoperative hospital stay was 2 days in patients undergoing laparoscopic lymph node dissection only.	0.7018197634023153
This minimally invasive procedure is particularly beneficial to patients with lymph node metastases not undergoing radical prostatectomy, as well as to patients planned to be treated by radiation therapy.	0.7060537575482475
The combination of laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical perineal prostatectomy avoids an abdominal incision and thus shortens both the hospital stay and the period of convalescence.	0.5998773183100904
Taking the concepts of psychic structure and internal representation as an example, three different ways of relating psychoanalytic concepts to neurobiology are presented and discussed: the localizing, the metaphorical and the modelling relation.	0.6554147732473589
The need is stressed not to mix up the different levels of description and explanation too early; at the same time it is argued that - after the dismissal of the old metapsychology - this way of relating offers a new chance to integrate neurobiological aspects in the concept of psychic structure without falling into the traps of biologistic reductionism and individualism.	0.5376760037932462
Following augmentation of the upper extremity muscles necessitated by damage to the brachial plexus, special post-operative care programs are required to provide the patient with the best possible results.	0.8170871921431742
Proper care requires cooperation between the orthopedic surgeon, physical therapists and nurses.	0.4568167268556337
Only then can postoperative rehabilitation and functional control of the extremity improve.	0.5174131560836296
We describe interdisciplinary postoperative care programs for augmentation of the deltoid muscle with trapezius transfer, arthrodesis of the glenohumeral joint, biceps augmentation with the latissimus dorsi transfer, Steindler flexorplasty and augmentation of flexors/extensors muscles in the hand.	0.424590973264764
The prevalence of type I allergy against latex was investigated in dental students by questionnaire, prick tests and the determination of specific IgE antibodies.	0.5839169155263065
Positive prick tests against different latex fluids were found in 18 (8.7%) of 206 students, with clinical relevance in 11 cases.	0.8374620988435816
When the total number of students in each semester was taken into account an increase in the minimal prevalence of clinically relevant latex allergy from 2% in the second semester to 10.4% in the tenth semester was seen.	0.7606589695045065
A history of glove intolerance presenting as a wheal-and-flare reaction was associated with a type I allergy against latex in only 50% of the affected subjects.	0.6067481232587898
Atopic diseases and hand eczema of different causes proved to be risk factors in 16 and 5 of 18 students with latex allergy, respectively.	0.5075901158841872
A high-ammonia accelerator-free latex fluid proved to be a very reliable test medium compared to the less sensitive determination of specific IgE antibodies to latex.	0.6386119989090647
Gastrointestinal obstruction is a frequently observed emergency with tumor patients.	0.3797857070930442
In addition to tumor relapse, the development of a second tumor or intraperitoneal tumor spreading, and benign alterations in advanced tumor stages (radiogenic stenosis, adhesions) may also be the cause for the obstruction.	0.7730409200865004
The main objective of therapy is an attempt to eliminate the intestinal obstruction through surgery.	0.6202270303953118
If this is not possible because of advanced intra-abdominal tumor expansion, several endoscopic or interventional radiology methods, and drugs are available, that are used on an individual basis and based on prevailing experience to relieve the patient's condition.	0.750598029947095
The case of a 60-year-old female patient with a supraglottic larynx carcinoma (T3N2CM0) and bilateral enlargement of the laryngeal sacculus is presented.	0.7236610064670529
On one side, the sacculus opened atypically into the left vestibular fold.	0.48698937078400806
The sacculus is a physiologic part of the roof of Morgagni's ventricle, the size of which can vary greatly.	0.6124121076334375
These canal-like structures can be the point of origin of cysts, laryngoceles, mucoceles, and pyoceles.	0.5028411406123573
Adverse effects of resuscitation due to closed-chest cardiac massage are common, and the incidence is increased when an incorrect technique is used.	0.7056652621753909

An overview of the 30 years history and developement of documentation and information systems in the Orthopedic University Hospital Heidelberg is presented.	0.5205078490008941
Since the foundation in 1967 four developmental phases can be described: first initiatives of medical doctors, establishment of a basic documentation system for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning and realisation of information systems with the possibility of controlling in medical areas and thereby steering of the services.	0.5253611627093167
Planning and realisation were accomplished within the framework of the masterplans and concepts of the university clinics of the state of Baden-Württemberg.	0.5743121649765481
The treatment success of nCPAP therapy (nasal continuous positive airway pressure) depends partly on the relief of symptoms and partly on long-term patient acceptance and the related avoidance of complications.Nasal complaints constitute the most frequently reported side effects and, together with problems of mask application, are among the primary factors causing an nCPAP-therapy to be prematurely discontinued.	0.619673723906148
The foramen ovale is anatomically open in 25 % of individuals, but functionally closed by the higher pressure in the left antrum.	0.7367847092120837
Right-to-left shunt and subsequent paradoxical embolism may occur when pressure in the left antrum rises, for example, as a result of pulmonary embolism.	0.7423527044102041

The mainstay of pharmacological therapy is preoperative treatment with oral phenoxybenzamine.	0.40975678431777157
This drug irreversibly alkylates alpha-1-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle and renders them nonfunctional, thereby causing vasodilatation.	0.5089916301361116
The duration of action of a single dose is approximately 24 h. Therefore, postoperative hypotension is a hazard of therapy with phenoxybenzamine if adequate plasma volume repletion is not provided.	0.5956113205251895
Prazosin, a short-acting, competitive alpha-1 blocker, has been used preoperatively, but has been criticized for its failure to adequately prevent perioperative hypertensive episodes.	0.7610796776801039

The use of the Kaufman-Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) was evaluated with a sample of 50 mentally disabled adults in a wide age range, as there exist no special tests for this group of patients.	0.7326664279071288
Intercorrelation- and factor analyses, and correlations with the German adaptation of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (HAWIE-R) proved the use of the K-ABC to be valid.	0.6729416466680084
As an assessment battery for children designed for the wide age range from 2-6 to 12-5 years is more adequate to the capability of intellectually impaired adults, the K-ABC delivers results on individual strengths and weaknesses, based on a neuropsychological theory.	0.6043957126377424
Thus the individual cognitive abilities can be assessed with more differentiation, and that gives an important base for intervention, partial remediation, and placement.	0.6730032195365678

The high rate of recurrence after the treatment of adhesive obstruction demands special prophylactic treatment.	0.5794979408776811
In a 13-year period, 52 out of 95 patients with major adhesions were provided with a long nasointestinal tube for intestinal splinting intraoperatively.	0.5935965415496719
The was being left in situ on an average of 6.6 days.	0.7010703683176653
After an observation period of at least 36 months a recurrence was seen in 2 of these 52 patients (3.9 %; causes: volvulus after 6 months/fibrinous peritonitis on the 6th postoperative day).	0.6811686279593762
Amongst the 43 'non-splinted' patients, recurrence of adhesive obstruction was documented in 8 cases (18.6 %; causes: adhesions after 0.3-136.9 months).	0.6014084957158413
In the course of aftercare abdominal complaints were significantly fewer in patients who had been splinted.	0.5989943256067716

AV-synchrony and rate-responsive pacing are known as major factors to increase the maximum working capacity in patients with chronotropic incompetence.	0.4946296121758598
However, their importance throughout low-levels of exercise is poorly evaluated.	0.5689750787139048
We studied 11 patients with implanted dual-chamber pacemakers (Telectronics, META 1254) concerning oxygen uptake kinetics during serial treadmill exercise testing at a constant workload of 35 W (LITE protocol).	0.4318350448079557
Each patient was tested in VVIR-, DDD-, and DDDR-mode.	0.6231816573694834
All AV delays were constant at 160ms.	0.1967469897588745
The oxygen deficit (O2D), mean response time (MRT) for oxygen uptake, and a oxygen deficit index (O2Di) were determined.	0.7650091006840117
In addition, the heart rate (HR) and bloodpressure were monitored.	0.613897727117799
Results: Significant differences (p<0.01) were observed in HR and O2D when comparing both DDD- to VVIR- and DDD- to DDDR-modes.	0.7687686187501916
Comparing the randomly synchronous VVIR- to the DDDR-mode, only the MRT of oxygen uptake demonstrated a significant decrease in the DDDR-mode (p<0.05).	0.6666496145314422
There were also significant decreases in O2Di and MRT in the DDDR-mode, as compared to the non-rate responsive DDD-mode (p<0.01).	0.5232706923056775
Stress testing in PM patients with an appropriate chronotropic response to low intensity exercise demontrates that AV synchrony is of much less influence on oxygen uptake kinetics than the rate-adaptive pacing.	0.4664767566996032
Purpose: This paper discusses the role of different imaging modalities in the diagnostic work-up of Crohn's disease (CD).	0.7792026340228732
Introduction: Results of animal experiments have demonstrated that the osseous integration of non-cemented prostheses can, at the very least temporarily, be impaired by the application of non-steroidal antiphlogistic agents (such as diclofenac).	0.6118606990360652
It is the objective of this study to examine whether there is a direct influence of diclofenac used in usual clinical dosages (3 times 50 mg daily) on bone cells and their progenitor cells which would explain the observed slow integration of the prostheses.	0.8205630292550617
Methods: To investigate this, cultivated human in vitro osteoblasts and stromal bone marrow cells were incubated with increasing doses of the medications.	0.6160722692131232
Our study focused on the effect of diclofenac application on proliferation and functional metabolism in both cell lines.	0.4027578785973346
The measurable maximal plasma concentration 2h after the application of one tablet Voltaren 50 reached 1.6µg/ml.	0.30380249463677883
This correlated with diclofenac concentrations between 1 and 10 ml found in our experiments.	0.426707151986329
The detected values were correlated to the control group (0 µg/ml diclofenac).	0.6454428985861281
Results: The drug effect upon osteoblasts was higher than on progenitor cells.	0.5196604087103626
The proliferation of in vitro stromal bone marrow cells, compared to untreated cells, was found to be decreased.	0.7568614799996244
We observed a decrease to 82% at a diclofenac concentration of 1 µg/ml, Osteoblasts exhibited a decrease to 97,5% at the same concentration.	0.806710489765196
The DNA synthesis increased to 118% in stromal bone marrow cells, in osteoblasts to 144%.	0.592924584574647
In contrast, we detected a neglectible decrease to 92% in the collagen synthesis of osteoblasts compared to untreated cells.	0.6530896836326628
The synthesis of osteocalcin by osteoblasts increased to 119%.	0.2861927525141544
The alkaline phosphatase activity was found to be decreased to 88% in stromal bone marrow cells and increased in osteoblasts to 111%.	0.5883312882514117
Conclusion: Temporary inhibiting effects on osseous integration in non-cemented prosthesis by diclofenac could be caused by a disturbance in the anabolic bone metabolism, exhibited by an increase of osteoblastic osteocalcin expression.	0.5333306914007782
Osteocalcin as a known negative regulator of the osteoneogenesis is most likely inhibiting the collagen matrix deposition.	0.40298522201539466
Recent investigations have controversially but convincingly interpreted the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (arteriosclerosis).	0.41663358814683876
Atherosclerosis can apparently be the result of ultrachronic, persistent infection by Chlamydia pneumoniae and not the result of heterogenous risk factors.	0.5047948359293714
The main arguments for chlamydial genesis are: Correlation of coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic diseases and antibodies against Chlamydia pneumoniae.	0.47687639308638596
(2) Chlamydia pneumoniae could be detected with different techniques (PCR, ICC, immunhistology, electromicroscopy, culture) in a high percentage of atheromas from different sites.	0.692636572859827
(3) According to three successful international studies with macrolides in coronary heart disease.	0.36364469660587645
(4) Target cells of atherosclerosis (endothelia, macrophages, muscle cells) can be infected by Chlamydia pneumoniae in vitro.	0.47007503808259793
(5) Provocation of arteriitis in animal experiments.	0.30369537528755575
(6) The reduction of incidence of atherosclerotic diseases since the 1960s, probably due to advances in antibiotic treatment.	0.6062521081280247
(7) Elevated levels of acute-phase proteins and other inflammatory signs (CRP, WBC count, fibrinogin) briefly before cardiac infarction occurs.	0.517605539178385
There are good arguments for intervention studies in coronary heart disease and other manifestations of atherosclerosis.	0.5195295778148021
The relevant antibiotics are available for chlamydial infections and are inexpensive and safe.	0.4873586598732645
Meticulous protocols and long-term monitoring of patients should be developed.	0.541131948070248
The pre- and postoperative symptoms of zygomatic bone fractures were examined in a follow-up study to prepare a classification proposal.	0.8154323447525905
A differential indication for minimally invasive therapy modes was looked for with respect to this proposal.	0.4097349623080666
Therapy of isolated zygomatic bone fractures consisted in repositioning with a hook and miniplate fixation across the frontozygomatic suture.	0.3642570952291172
The aims of this study were clinical and radiological assessment of the repositioning result in terms of aesthetics and stability and quantification of the postoperative remission of disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve.	0.7239195456914639
A total of 52 patients were examined.	0.7466437473851693
After the operation (on average after 3.5 days following the trauma) they were followed-up postoperatively for 12 months according to a strict schedule.	0.8058616406335081
Preoperatively, 49 patients reported disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve.	0.47423054487405664
Other symptoms, such as periorbital haematoma and flattening of the zygomatic prominence, were observed in 49 patients and 45 patients, respectively.	0.6290836574215859
All fractures were repositioned well as assessed clinically and radiologically.	0.49700218604395074
The aesthetic result was evaluated as symmetric and durable in all cases.	0.4485417395249789
Six months postoperatively 41 patients reported normal sensitivity in the area of the infraorbital nerve.	0.42550727594169563
In only five patients (10.2%) was the sensitivity loss persistent throughout the entire follow-up period.	0.787715991703531
Patients with primarily lacking diplopia developed neither eye motility disturbances nor postoperative enophthalmus in the following period.	0.4101574293017448
It can be concluded that the treatment of an isolated zygomatic bone fracture which satisfies aesthetic and functional requirements is possible by reposition and fixation with one miniplate at the lateral orbital rim.	0.5907798752258738
An additional osteosynthesis at the infraorbital rim or at the zygomaticomaxillary crista is not necessary.	0.4235442573473913
A routine revision of the orbital floor is only indicated in cases of preoperative diplopia.	0.5370499495334765
A zygomatic bone fracture connected with diplopia should be classified as combined zygomatic-/orbital floor fracture.	0.494490006489581
Chronic primary headache has a considerable impact on the quality of life.	0.48420418025138534
To date, this impact has been evaluated by measurements of the general pain specific impairment of the quality of life.	0.689162963933927
Headache specific measurements of quality of life or of disability caused by the headache are still missing for the German language.	0.7141808836446459
In America, a headache specific questionnaire, the "Headache Disability Inventory" (HDI), has been evaluated which is used in the presented study to create a German version, the "Inventar zur Beeinträchtigung durch Kopfschmerzen" (IBK).	0.7120941575789881
94 consecutive patients with a primary headache disorder (59 female, 35 male; mean age 40 +/- 12 years) were examined.	0.8747543460038716
Cronbach's alpha was a=0.90, the test-retest-reliability after three months was r=0.87.	0.41637924023593376
An analysis of subscales for emotional and functional disability showed similar values for the internal consistency and the test-retest-reliability of these subscales.	0.43340599455562384
The scores of the different headache types did not differ significantly.	0.6837139948252454
In post-hoc-analyses, however, cluster headache showed higher disability scores than migraine both in the total scale and in the subscales.	0.5101429504401314
The total score of the IBK was significantly correlated with the number of headache days per month (r=0.41; p<0.0003) but not with the duration of disease or other demographic parameters.	0.5795660131892547
The IBK is the first German headache specific measurement of certain aspects of the quality of life in chronic headache patients.	0.7199757925566554
It can be used in clinical settings to evaluate the current state of the patient or to monitor treatment and it can be used for scientific studies.	1.0398493288815776
Age and menstrual cycle have an important influence on the breast.	0.5763762146088154
This well-known fact is experienced in the daily routine of gynecologists and radiologists.	0.5086456532647703
The number of publications addressing the effect of these influences on imaging, however, is surprisingly low.	0.5889542336824466
The aim of this work is to describe the influences of age and menstrual cycle on the breast and to address their clinical relevance for mammography and MR mammography.	0.6886432981573302
Therefore, own data are presented concerning the age and menstrual cycle influences on breast parenchyma in dynamic MR mammography.	0.4639515329438532
Literature data are used to correlate mammography and MR imaging findings with these influences.	0.5924994238349376
The changes of the breast due to age and menstrual cycle have important direct implications on performing and reading conventional mammography and MR mammography.	0.504527037989755
The knowledge of these changes is also helpful in the interpretation of findings when comparing different methods.	0.564031883840345

Appendectomy is one of the most frequent surgical procedures.	0.5717991044269464
Accuracy in the clinical diagnosis of acute non-specific appendicitis, however, suffers from the fact that the symptoms and clinical findings of acute appendicitis can be mimicked by many other abdominal diseases.	0.7211434419551674
The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis, therefore, can only be definitely confirmed by pathomorphological analysis, the criteria of which are reviewed in this paper.	0.7665721390305968
Special emphasis is given to distinct variants of acute appendicitis and the significance of neuroappendicopathy.	0.62205801460114
Extra-articular interventions by osteotomies to correct the axial malpositioning of the joint (genu varum or valgum) are treatments proven over many years.	0.5794247792374558
The middle and long term results shows many patients are very satisfied.	0.5976265467917143
Unfortunately a uniform critical examination is lacking because the investigators used no scores.	0.31264896094206057
The good results by infra- and supracondylar osteotomies - some of them for 15 years and more - have to be achieved by prosthesis first.	0.7673619981609405
The important facts for gonarthrosis of the knee joint are the axial malpositioning, the miss load, and the instability of the joint; these facts are the cause for the complaints and for the restriction of functional efficiency.	0.7803961239457657
Therefore, indication of infra- or supracondylar osteotomies is not limited by the age of the patient.	0.712248851189153
The most important fact is the condition of the joint, especially the quality of bone, the instability of the joint, and the loss of bone.	0.9418036066921442
Given the right indication, the treatment of genu varum and valgum by osteotomies is an important factor in preserving the joint.	0.5904748832921
Also, there are still chances to do another operation, such a prothesis.	0.8706483784412515
A prothesis can be implanted if the osteotomy has no chance to preserve the joint.	0.43460579514988623
Psychic trauma may be followed by a variety of unpredictable reactions by the subject, which differ individually and are dependant upon the situation.	0.5403422347646433
Differentiation between psychic crises and psychiatric emergency situations (PES) is often difficult as the first might proceed into the second and definitions of the two tend to blur.	0.715983686019942
This article aims to overview the different psychic and psychiatric disturbances which are relevant in preclinical emergency medicine.	0.3836033864061004
A definition is offered to outline PES that require immediate medical intervention and crises due to psycho-social reasons.	0.3544329187997364

Acute pancreatitis is a multietiologic entity with rather diverse clinical courses.	0.3302692670748374
Whereas edematous pancreatitis has a mortality of less than 1%, nowadays; still approximately 20% of all patients with the necrotizing form succumb to the disease.	0.7646612297143245
To further improve therapeutic results a standardized approach should be used.	0.5456847252524231
For effective treatment the differentiation between edematous and necrotizing pancreatitis is crucial.	0.4612918710376406
All patients with signs of pancreatic necroses during abdominal ultrasound and patients with organ insufficiencies should undergo a CT-scan to define exactly the nature and the extent of the disease.	0.6604862660709442
Primarily all patients are treated conservatively.	0.7169061335257373
Main indications for operative intervention are signs for infection of pancreatic necroses and an acute abdomen due to local complications of acute pancreatitis.	0.6237141175845645
In cases of biliary origin an elective cholecystectomy has to be performed during a free interval to prevent a recurrence.	0.6687961281434474
Objective: Diagnosis of osteomyelitis is difficult in early state of disease.	0.582556276548183
Usually, characteristic X-ray findings cannot be obtained during the first week of disease.	0.7945375370120404
Sonography, scintigraphy and magnetic resonance tomography were compared at clinical manifestation of osteomyelitis.	0.5510653358894054
A 73-year old female patient is known to have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) since 1989.	0.6772217497538241
After a transmural anterolateral myocardial infarction with the development of a large apical aneurysma of the anterior wall, a previously measured gradient of 11 mm Hg in the LVOT is no longer detected.	0.694899449734102
As a consequence of this casuistry, "pseudo-myectomy" caused by myocardial as an example of an uncommon spontaneous course of HOCM.	0.6863364617009805
Aim: Intensified insulin therapy is the therapy of choice for patients with diabetes Type I.	0.7027398616740972
Intensified insulin therapy includes an basis-bolus insulin injection regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, several times daily blood glucose self-monitoring, self-adaptation of insulin dosages by the patients themselves and a far-reaching liberalization of nutrition.	0.45460006103373485
The patients learn selfmanagement of diabetes therapy in a structured treatment and teaching program.	0.45476481835258464
The effectivity of this program is evaluated in the routine care.	0.595167074877877
The treatment of idiopathic scoliosis over 40  ° (Cobb) during the growth period is under discussion concerning the indication for conservative or surgical treatment.	0.6672638076827012
Curve progression depends on the degree of the frontal and sagittal deformity, vertebral rotation, rigidity of the curve, the skeletal age, the age and sex of the patient, the familial frequency of scoliosis and the location of the curve.	0.744510454107641
In scoliosis over 40  ° progression is fast and the possibilities for successful conservative brace treatment are reduced during the growth period.	0.48915462620758926
Progression occurs more frequently in thoracic and double major scolioses, especially in young patients (Risser sign 0 and 1).	0.615682073721434
The purpose of this study was to evaluate low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with an open system and to correlate results obtained with the experience of the radiologist.	0.8298405312624608
Between August 1995 and May 1997, 75 patients at the Unfallchirurgische Universitätsklinik, Mainz, Germany, with an acute trauma of the knee joint were operated on arthroscopically after clinical examination, X-ray and MRI imaging.	0.7219735415445951
MRI analysis was performed by two independent radiologists with varying MRI experience without knowledge of the patient's history.	0.7421102702057454
The sensitivity and specifity of the more [U1] and the less experienced [U2] radiologist ranged from 83 to 100% (U1) and from 61 to 100% (U2).	0.6657235539638839
Positive and negative predictive value ranged from 83 to 100% (U1) and from 58 to 100% (U2); accuracy ranged from 92 to 100% (U1) and from 77 to 100% (U1).	0.5938699293688585
We conclude that the results of low-field MRI are comparable with those of high-field MRI and that differences in the results of the experienced and less experienced radiologist can be established.	0.8655159992437753
In intervention trials it was without exception possible to influence the development of atherosclerosis by a reduction of the LDL-cholesterol and an increase in HDL-cholesterol and to reduce complications like myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, angina or heart failure.	0.5708489810655978
Changes of lifestyle can be effective, but are rarely accepted and are difficult to communicate.	0.6595604062778595
Dermatosurgery has been gaining in importance in recent years.	0.3283550223358015
In departments of dermatology German-speaking countries the total number of operations increased by 58% from 1984 to 1991.	0.5815651803400301
The increase in the number of operations of moderate and extreme severity was especially marked.	0.5334822202135239
Out-patient dermatosurgery was also performed mainly by dermatologists as opposed to other specialties.	0.42220959157176813
From 1988 to 1992 dermatologists in private practice recorded an increase of 40.6% in the number of operative procedures they performed.	0.6289977584028507
The importance of dermatosurgery in hospital and private practice can be expected to continue increasing in the future; dermatologists must therefore prepare themselves for the present and future challenges inherent in surgery of the skin.	0.6440565813550093
There is evidence that diastolic function is a major determinant of overall cardiac performance.	0.5236479248281155
Intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) enables Doppler measurement of mitral inflow pattern (E/A ratio).	0.4663077438186224
The E/A ratio is suggested to be a reliable index of changes in myocardial relaxation.	0.6063195884345155
In the present study we compared the time course of the E/A ratio and the time constant of myocardial relaxation () assessed by direct left ventricular pressure recordings in patients before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).	0.7233146665193184
After ethical approval, 12 patients undergoing CABG surgery were studied.	0.5200819087543366
Measurements of the E/A ratio and  were performed after induction of anesthesia (I), immediately prior to CPB with the pericardium open (II), 5 min after CPB (III), and after sternal closure (IV).	0.6866781896334707
Time constant of myocardial relaxation was calculated as the reciprocal value of the slope of the left ventricular dP/dt and left ventricular pressure plot.	0.6524342423592449
The E/A ratio was significantly decreased at the end of surgery (IV).	0.41898094453241475
In contrast,  was increased immediately after CPB, but decreased after sternal closure (IV).	0.5470342015760834
Cardiac index and heart rate both increased after CPB.	0.4255754661098864
The results of the present study demonstrate that diastolic dysfunction occurred immediately after CPB, as indicated by an increase in the time constant of myocardial relaxation.	0.7613604950172913
However,  improved rapidly to pre-CPB values.	0.6620720475693097
The E/A ratio alone failed to detect the initial post-CPB alteration in left ventricular relaxation.	0.4239340488944112
Acute exercise is followed by a mobilization of white blood cells, mainly induced by increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol.	0.5407869409036965
NK-cells react the most intensive, they can increase fivefold after intensive exercise.	0.49443609736245997
Additionally a weak acute-phase reaction occurs.	0.3275718695526269
Most of these changes normalize during twenty-four hours.	0.6203934170445328
Parameters of the humoral immune system may be different from the pre-exercise levels up to seventy-two hours.	0.5548259557027413
Repeated physical exercise, which is typical for sports, is followed only by small changes of immunologic parameters under conditions of rest.	0.6701406521148295
Epidemiological studies give clues that the rate of upper respiratory tract infections in athletes can be described by a j-shaped curve.	0.5292446329290899
Moderately active subjects have the lowest rate of infection.	0.3621757828349371
For this influence of exercise on health mainly functional changes seem to be important.	0.49928395092419225
Especially after exccentric exercise immunological cells can be seen in the muscle tissue, which remove destructed tissue.	0.611368306310862
Not very much is known about the role of the immune system in the regeneration of tendons and other bradytrophic tissues.	0.6056379353766018
To achieve septoplasty without compromising the surgical goal of attaining a straight and solid septum, even in cases of marked deviations or severe post-traumatic deformities, we now use a new technique in which the septal reconstruction includes the placement of a resorbable implant as a "compound graft".	0.6888009393360998
For this purpose the entire septal cartilage is removed, and the severely deviated part is divided into straight sections that are reconnected to each other to form a straight and solid plate.	0.5886310851066023
As connecting material we use a polydioxanon (PDS) foil.	0.3132286272700182
The sections of cartilage are sutured to the foil with PDS suture material.	0.29680561804368955
The compound graft thus constructed consists of the septal cartilage and resorbable alloplastic material and is reimplanted into the nose.	0.4351188539084738
The PDS and suture material are usually resorbed within 8 months, excluding long-term complications.	0.5274603535030253
During the past 2 years this method was used in treating 38 patients.	0.737595621162846
The surgical goal was attained in every case, and no immediate or long-term complications occurred.	0.8128525449299957
This method of combining septal cartilage with a resorbable implant leads to a better, significant correction of even severe septal deviations.	0.5922534180923967
Two types of corticosteroid receptors have been identified in the brain and pituitary that play an important role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis.	0.5231326850305489
These glucocorticoid hormone binding receptors are the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).	0.4989195654155549
Evidently, a tight control of the concentration and function of these receptors is of prime importance for maintaining and regaining homeostasis after stressful challenges.	0.5664118928638019
Here, we describe a novel mechanism revealing a rapid upsurge in MR density in the hippocampus (a limbic structure highly involved in HPA axis regulation) after an acute psychologically stressful challenge.	0.6518731512795942
This rise in MR is accompanied by a stronger MR-mediated inhibitory control of the HPA axis.	0.51260383703657
Thus, an acute stressful experience results in a reorganization of the HPA axis involving a principal role of the hippocampal MR.	0.6293778205073132
This novel mechanism may be of significance for increasing our understanding of the etiology of stress-related disorders.	0.6706715328243067
The wide variety of therapeutic effects make neuroleptics potent drugs in the treatment of pain.	0.5275837856183285
Until now there has been no proof of their analgesic potency; in spite of this fact, neuroleptics are used to treat chronic pain states on the assumption that they do have analgesic potency.	0.6827646297006497
A metaanalysis was performed and 48 publications reviewed.	0.5220523708623143
Thirty-four, the majority of the studies, are case reports, retrospective analyses or non-randomised cohort studies.	0.7545327619259863
Most of these reports attest to a positive effect.	0.6642365214880886
However, only ten out of fifteen studies with a higher statistical study power describe a possible analgesic effect.	0.5687101850353234
None of the studies could differentiate between the effects of analgesia and sedation of the drugs used.	0.6078031153339958
The metaanalysis provides no evidence of intrinsic analgesic properties of neuroleptics for their use as adjuvant analgesics.	0.39809229358913784
Studies into the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke have indicated that treatment options are likely to be optimised when early signs of stroke are recognised and treatment is initiated within 3 hours from symptom onset.	0.5467475000125601
For most patients there is a long delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.	0.7209489040915797
Many factors are responsible for this time delay: signs and symptoms often go unrecognised by patients, relatives and bystanders and stroke is not given a high priority by medical staff.	0.49188603999448544
Although a small number of stroke patients is treated as emergency and attended to by the emergency medical services within this time window, this number could easily be increased by intensified public and emergency personnel education.	0.5732902085592954
For the future, we hope that emergency medical services (EMS) will be able to initiate therapies which must be administered within the first few hours of acute stroke.	0.6086362577336536
Standard of care by the EMS personnel includes maintenance of oxygenation, treatment of cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension as well as hyperglycemia and hyperthermia.	0.6198240452757884
Early notification by the emergency medical services about stroke patients would enable stroke teams to be present at admission, thus improving the likelihood of a better outcome for patients.	0.5588848883546794
A decrease in compliance of the ascending aorta caused by prosthetic replacement or "wrapping" may lead to a partial loss of the arterial Windkessel-function.	0.6342199888008128
The following study investigated the effects of this intervention on aortic input impedance.	0.5355591284306263
In 8 pigs, the wall of the ascending aorta was wrapped with a prosthesis.	0.6127507747137054
This approach was chosen to minimize additional influence of extended operative procedures on the ascending aorta, like extracorporal circulation, cardioplegia or blood loss.	0.5206878005745581
Flow and pressure were recorded before and after the intervention, and following Fourier Transformation, the aortic input impedance was calculated.	0.6929578194757421
Mean pressure, mean flow, and total peripheral resistance were unaltered, while there was a significant increase in blood pressure amplitude and characteristic impedance in response to the "wrapping" procedure.	0.7199630282892057
Thus, it becomes obvious that even the loss of elastic properties of the ascending aorta only leads to an increase of left ventricular load.	0.7727761741774233
Cervical lymphadenopathies are widespread diseases in otorhinolaryngology.	0.2330037353602138
There are many differential diagnoses which have to be considered when swelling persists.	0.7103406875384654
To gain further information it is advisable to perform sonographically controlled fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNP).	0.42336498960043817
If there is no reliable result, it is necessary to remove a lymph node.	0.679372282701424
We report on the rare case of isolated histiocytosis X in lymph nodes.	0.6957690076055885
A 63-year-old male had noticed a swelling of the right side of the neck about 6 weeks previously.	0.7607348365089506

Microcallus formations are demonstrable in nearly all cancellous bones by means of suitable preparation techniques.	0.3919492927923055
Histologically, these structures are immature fibrous bone formed in local overloaded parts of the trabeculae.	0.4659959271333215
Using a preparation technique that allows combined two- and threedimensional analysis, 26 normal human spines and 11 osteoporotic spines were investigated for microcallus.	0.5476809266617384
Microcallus formations occur frequently in people over 45 years of age.	0.36512023580033864
They are mainly localized in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine and occur significantly more frequent in females than in males.	0.6288094992335129
The number of microcallus formations depends more on the microarchitecture of the cancellous bone than on individual trabecular parameters.	0.35564175345163856
In about 33 % of cases microfractures are demonstrable in the centre of the microcallus formation.	0.6804949404831004
In noninvasive studies the bone mass could be misinterpreted due to microcallus.	0.3164395977128903
Although it indicates instability of the bone structure, microcallus formation is not a purely negative mechanism.	0.6738958514582624
It stabilizes and regenerates the bone tissue.	0.20161231616608444
Furthermore, complete new trabeculae can be formed due to bridges of microcallus between residual trabeculae.	0.40198104085391434

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral leukoplakia (OL) in HIV-positive patients and to evaluate the clinical and histopathological features and the presence of Candida hyphae and viral infections (HSV 1, 2, HPV, EBV and CMV) by immunocytochemical methods using mono- or polyclonal antibodies.	0.7917769976874701
A total of 269 HIV-seropositive patients, (222 men, median age 36.7 years and 47 women, median age 32 years) were registered.	0.7377782771026192
OL occurred in 20/269 (7.4%) patients (men, smokers, median age 38 years); the non-homogeneous form was observed in 11%.	0.6555146859310796
A lesional biopsy specimen was obtained from 8/20 patients.	0.38314194748920566
Specimens did not show signs of epithelial dysplasia.	0.43511532583290646
Candida hyphae were evident in 2/8 cases.	0.4438266742459698
Two patients tested positive for HPV and CMV; antibodies against EBV, HSV1 and 2 were negative.	0.3538446326402741
In conclusion, the prevalence of OL is comparatively high in this group of HIV-seropositive patients (7.4% vs. 0.9-2.2%).	0.8099183474659751
Moreover, the mean age of the study group at the time of diagnosis for oL was lower (38 years vs. 60 years).	0.9220269377513771
Damage/dysfunctioning of the heart forms part of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in sepsis and SIRS.	0.6154140255020487
This acute septic cardiomyopathy is often underestimated in degree and relevance, although about 10% of all sepsis fatalities are due to intractable heart failure.	0.6076025806962563
This potentially reversible cardiomyopathy is characterized by a considerable pump failure, not primarily ischemic, with coronary blood flow being normal or even enhanced; the left and right ventricle is enlarged as a consequence of an increased ventricular compliance.	0.6368322090745644
Damage of the heart can further be aggravated in case of additional right ventricular impairment due to pulmonary hypertension in ARDS.	0.5630399475296046
SIRS-cardiomyopathy in non-infectious MODS has common traits with acute septic cardiomyopathy.	0.4382430981155647
The pathogenesis of heart disease in sepsis and SIRS is multifactorial, the endotoxin/TNF/NO/ cGMP-cascade representing a main negative inotropic axis.	0.5059989480097161
Therapy of acute septic cardiomyopathy and SIRS-cardiomyopathy at present is still mainly symptomatic (volume substitution, inotropic/vasoactive agents); causal therapeutic principles are, however, put to test in the context of a comprehensive concept of causal sepsis treatment.	0.509265422857864
Fractures of the distal metaphysis of the tibia often include an extension into the ankle.	0.6789504286544181
Intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis should reduce the high incidence of soft tissue and ankle problems and should be an alternative to open plate fixation, with good ultimate functional outcome.	0.6767394764962811
Between January 1993 and December 1995, a prospective study on 49 patients with distal metaphyseal tibia fracture and involvement of the ankle was performed.	0.7238756524284599
All the fractures were treated with intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis, and plate fixation in cases of fibula fractures.	0.6171217160486085
There were 27 men and 22 women with an average age of 46.4  +/-  12.7 years (range 21-90).	0.7835959676496451
In most studies of the use of intramedullary nailing in distal tibial fractures the classification has been inadequate.	0.4843894516912924
Therefore a new classification according to Robinson et al.	0.44964048520724564
(1995) was used: 10 fractures were type II B (20.4 %), 13 were type II C (26.5 %), and 26 patients suffered a combination of type II B and type II C (53.1 %).	0.7460748607872896
This fracture type was defined as type II D for use in this study.	0.5567384221761252
The severity of soft tissue injury was recorded using the Gustilo system in case of open (n = 19) and the Tscherne system in case of closed fractures (n = 30).	0.5822853238119663
In 31 patients distal tibia fracture was accompanied by a fracture of the fibula, which was first stablized using a plate.	0.7460902481321376
For reconstruction of the distal articular surface, covered screw osteosynthesis was done.	0.6086413615683355
At the next step intramedullary nails were inserted and were statically locked proximally and distally.	0.4296549536045968
From January 1993 to February 1994, the reamed AO standard nail was used.	0.4822116920679845
After introduction of the unreamed tibial nail (UTN) all fractures were treated by this implant.	0.6665958454688269
Full load on the operated leg was allowed after 8 weeks.	0.4528461685634304
Union of the fracture was assessed by standard radiological and clinical criteria.	0.7818065070338076
Misalignment was defined as more than 5  ° of angular rotation.	0.6961882535389216
Further surgery due to a valgus deformity in the ankle joint had to be done in three cases.	0.7395477197803303
There were no deep infections.	0.5541741150864393
Three patients had a superficial infection in the ankle area, but surgical debridement was not necessary.	0.8918317732265064
A leg shortening was found in 4 cases, but it was less than 1 cm in every case.	0.9295437360945937
Therefore, surgical correction was not done.	0.6293002177458031
Patients were reviewed at intervals of 2, 6, and 12 weeks, and after 6, and at least 12 months.	1.0731737007090676
All 49 patients were finally reviewed after an average time of 15.7 months (range 12-38).	0.752739533360003
Bone fusion was reached 12.8 weeks (range 9-21) after the operative treatment.	0.8286278277442889
A specific assessment of the ankle symptoms was made using the score of Olerud and Molander (1984).	0.5828550835066344
In 29 patients excellent results were recorded.	0.33660798827704097
A satisfactory result was attained with 17 patients and just 3 patients were found to be unsatisfactory.	0.5184494156973407
Although proximity of distal tibia fracture to the ankle makes the treatment more complicated than for fractures of the tibial diaphysis, closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a good alternative to open reduction and plate fixation.	0.5689755647304382
The major advantages are closed procedure and simplified interlocking techniques.	0.32586363681366864
Therefore, closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a safe and effective method of managing this type of fracture.	0.5799901016581619
Laryngeal candidiasis is very rare in the absence of other more proximal diseases in the aerodigestive tract.	0.5370782221241599
The lesion shows pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia or acanthosis and, given its rarity, may be confused with cancer.	0.5665412816823007
In the present paper we report on a 56-year-old male patient who presented with hoarseness.	0.8120346499038824
Physical examination of the larynx revealed a hyperplastic lesion involving both vocal cords.	0.48996526397707935
The clinical aspect and the risk factor profile of the patient (ten bottles of beer and 40 cigarettes per day) generated the clinical diagnosis of laryngeal cancer.	0.7223344548713964
The histopathological examination of the specimen excluded a squamous cell carcinoma; however, it could not provide a clear diagnosis.	0.7106826646272489
Laryngeal papillomatosis and tuberculosis, which had been suspected, could be excluded.	0.7112572269893048
As the lesion progressed, further biopsies led to the diagnosis of candidiasis.	0.6036571062954049
Systemic antimycotic treatment with fluconazol and amphotericin caused a complete remission.	0.37734077283389716
Lymphatic spread of bronchial carcinoma can reach any part of the mediastinum, irrespective of the localisation of the primary tumor.	0.5659007925369429
Metastatic spread may not affect al topographical lymph node positions, but this is unpredictable.	0.5540562052633173
The number of lymph nodes in each position varies.	0.5486348867964251
Therefore, systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection includes all ipsilateral compartments of the mediastinum.	0.4551629411085178
It is also possible to reach contralateral sites.	0.7337770941286492
In right-sided thoracotomies the lymph node dissection is standardized.	0.623785479218561
Mobilizing the aortic arch and the large vessels also allows complete mediastinal dissection by a left-sided approach.	0.46721134963519617
The surgical technique is described.	0.6674574247138416
Perioperative morbidity does not increase.	0.32360614961008727
Systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection is the gold standard for evaluation of an exact pN stage.	0.5811849128793926
The stage-related survival rate is significantly improved.	0.684101739833335
Therefore, it should be required that systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection be standard in the surgical treatment of bronchial carcinoma.	0.7884781631878254
In the diagnosis and treatment of acute scrotal pain and swelling it is important to differentiate between testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis.	0.7406458777254622
A special case of a thirty-eight-year-old male asylant from Nepal was presented in the urological service with acute scrotal pain.	0.5635938005862593
To exclude testicular torsion, a diagnostic exploration of the scrotum was done with the findings of an acute funiculitis with abscess formation.	0.7000157723526498
Under surgical drainage of abscess together with medical treatment the acute inflammation disappeared.	0.3814587386788419

We studied 10 patients with Parkinson's disease and 12 patients with Parkinson-plus-syndrome, trying to improve patients' gait by application of various external rhythmic stimuli, including metronome stimulation (96 beats per minute=middle andante).	0.593224040249439
The test course of the patients was 4x10 meters and 3 U-turns.	0.7594155651382601
The patients' gait quality under stimulation was compared with their free walk (velocity, number of steps, number of freezing episodes).	0.5735307545707313
Metronome stimulation significantly reduced the time and number of steps needed for the test course and also diminished the number of freezing episodes.	0.5835054340101175
March music stimulation was less effective and tactile stimulation (rhythmically tapping on the patient's shoulder) even produced negative results.	0.48365691474860306
The positive effect of metronome stimulation was also found, when the tests were not performed inside the hospital building, but outside in the hospital parc.	0.7087081790534878
Metronome stimulation was comparably effective in both patient sub-groups examined in this study (M. Parkinson, Parkinson-plus-syndrome) and seems to be an important additional help in the treatment of these patients.	0.7736573673349704
Electronical metronomes are not expensive, easy in handling, and portable.	0.5087328953381969

In 14 patients with acute LBP the effect of manual therapy was examined.	0.6909633344715376
The examination was conducted with the Triflexometer, which is an electromechanical measuring instrument for examination of the posture and function of the spine.	0.7511656952769108
This instrument makes possible the measurement of the spine in resting as well as in moving positions, and it is also suitable for recording local disturbances of the movement.	0.8060376795269009
In our study we measured the spine from C7 to S2 in the sagittal and frontal planes.	0.5698272325476826
Improvement in movement was detected in all patients following manual therapy, as well as in ante-, retro- and lateral flexion on both sides, and local functional disturbances also disappeared partially or totally.	0.6820030883993587
Our study shows that the Triflexometer makes it possible to record the effect of manual therapy in acute LBP.	0.5940822831197787
The proof of the local functional disturbances after manual therapy indicates that these patients have a higher risk of new episodes of acute LBP or perhaps of chronic LBP, and because of that there it is necessary to use other treatment forms.	0.6394084865609451

All patients gained weight and reported less complaints after antibiotic treatment with metronidazole.	0.37391548812684755
Discussion: Small bowel bacterial overgrowth has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of failure to thrive, especially in cases with preexisting intestinal disease.	0.730247192062195
The diagnosis may be substantiated by a combination of indirect methods.	0.42758145672853315
Direct bacteriologic analysis is difficult.	0.16672631615399588
Usually, antibiotic treatment leads to a good weight gain after a short period of time.	0.5541458122610013
In contrast to carotid endarterectomy, the indication for vertebral surgery is not standardized.	0.6679707462385438
In a prospective study including 44 patients, it was investigated whether extended diagnostics help in making the decision as to whether operative treatment should be given.	0.8015150561415831
The diagnostic procedures included DSA, CCT, MRI, 24 h ECG, otoneurological, and neurological examination, and ultrasonic flow measurement.	0.6253407618346465
We compared the diagnostic results before and after surgery with the subjective symptoms of the patients.	0.7040712744933793
Two different surgical procedures were used: transposition of the vertebral artery to the CCA or graft implantation between CCA and atlas loop.	0.5453197472044622
In the follow up period (6 - 9 months), 72% of the patients had improved or were without complaints.	0.9691652544023225
The validity of the applied diagnostic parameters relating to a successful operation were disappointing especially the ultrasonic flow measurement.	0.4718757483721774
In our opinion, exact anamnesis and sufficient angiography are decisive for the indication of vertebral surgery.	0.49941741631870723
It has long been a goal to develop a means to measure squint angles in three dimensions simultaneously.	0.48331969007688214
A three-dimensional binocular method is naturally needed especially with surgical procedures that affect three dimensions of ocular motility.	0.459192692166263
In situations of depressed myocardial function, the role of immunological mechanisms has been studied recently.	0.5447966634800693
In different pathophysiological situations, such as chronic heart failure, open heart surgery with extracorporal circulation, cardiac transplantation, myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, patterns have been described with elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and reversible myocardial dysfunction, which may represent a final common pathway.	0.7415003743788678
The available data suggest a modulation of important determinants of pump function, i.e., contractility, preload, afterload, and heart rate, by cytokines.	0.6271268555181287
Potential mechanisms include the -adrenoceptor- and nitric oxide pathway, as well as a direct impact on intracellular calcium homeostasis.	0.6769984787359993
Interventional strategies based on this understanding are beginning to emerge.	0.40953616396800113
A prospective randomized study was designed to determine the effect of postoperative water contact on tissue healing.	0.6006480884115438
A total of 121 patients undergoing open hernia repair was divided into two groups.	0.4286019199546875
The first group was permitted to shower postoperatively, allowing the wound to come into direct contact with the water, the second group was instructed to keep the incision dry.	0.5410226266555695
Water contact, wound healing and patient satisfaction were assessed.	0.4827654689581055
There was no difference in wound healing between the two groups and no manifest infection.	0.7099161374999639
In children and adolescents motor/vocal tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior are known to be closely related.	0.520989581973972
Thereby, a continuum of symptoms ranging from single tics to a mixed picture of tics/rituals/obsessive-compulsive traits to clinically relevant obsessions and compulsions could be described.	0.4268540348057752
As neurobiological substrates dysfunctions in corresponding cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits (sensorimotor circuit in tic symptomatology, orbitofrontal circuit in obsessive-compulsive behavior) were postulated.	0.4002915657861054
For both disturbances behavioral therapy can be used to improve control mechanisms to counterregulate tics and obsessive-compulsive behavior, respectively, and psychopharmacological agents can be administerd to compensate dysbalances in neurotransmitter systems.	0.567984386663055
In case of a mixed symptomatologic picture it is necessary to include interventions for both pols of the symptom-continuum in the therapeutic programme to achieve extensive improvement as a basis for a further positive development of the patient.	0.6165031394154695
As laparoscopic cholecystectomy becomes more established, interest in legal aspects increases.	0.3927723669550506
The legal cases dealt with in Germany since the introduction of this laparoscopic method in 1989 were studied to determine the legal consequences of complications.	0.45093099399346587
Of 40 cases, 16 were judged to be cases of malpractice, whereas 24 were not.	0.5402479427751222
The most common cause was injury of the common bile duct (26 cases).	0.7169015173892015
Seven of these 26 cases were judged to be cases of malpractice, 2 of these as grave errors.	0.5456464695499479
The main reasons for the acceptance of a case as malpractice were delay in changing to conventional cholecystectomy, delayed revision, laparoscopic revisions and not reverting to conventional cholecystectomy in unclear situations.	0.5964870570292427
Purpose of this review is, to highlight key issues in transplantation medicine today and to summarise basic information on current state of perfused organ transplantation.	0.5949449671704025
There is special emphasis on ethical and legal considerations with regard to living donor transplantation, brain death concept, donor consent and organ allocation.	0.5161678477765016
Transplantation frequencies and the impact of whole organ transplantation on the treatment concept for patients with end stage organ disease is heavily dependent on donor and organ availability.	0.5465818102936298
Organ donor rate of 25 to 30 donors per million inhabitants per year seems to yield sufficient organ supply for patients on renal replacement therapy.	0.3966012945451813
15 to 20 liver transplantations per million inhabitants per year, my be sufficient, to cover the need of organs for non malignant end stage liver diseases.	0.5479240842497448
This frequency my be achieved by increasing donor rates and employing "split techniques", where one liver is used for two recipients.	0.5541948184166651
One year graft survival in kidney transplantation can be expected to be between 85 and 90 %, one year patient survival in heart and liver transplantation can be expected to be beyond 80 %.	0.6618356677732644
The risk of organ failure is highest in the first year, long term results are dependent on incidence of chronic rejection, comorbidity of the patient and original disease.	0.8864381210152592
Patient- and/or graft loss after the first year is in the order of 1 to 5 %.	0.820046670438597
Whole organ transplantation for kidneys, hearts and livers are considered routine procedures, lung transplantation is reaching standard phase, pancreas and combined pancreas kidney transplantation is well established technically, but its indication is still controversial.	0.5352271962174836
Laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) is a promising method of treating different types of tumors.	0.5968601704859263
To increase the effectiveness of LITT, a new thermo-controlled application system for minimal invasive intervention was designed.	0.6344698570130024
This laser system consists of a laser applicator 3 mm in diameter, insertion equipment and an Nd:YAG laser source.	0.4986561710011819
The power of the laser source is controlled dynamically by thermosensors in a water-cooling system of the laser applicator.	0.579012807384005
In in vivo experiments in five pigs, within 10 min we found homogeneous coagulation regions in the liver that were of 3 cm and 5 cm in diameter.	0.6092189960663267
Via ultrasound we observed in real time the increasing coagulation zone that appeared as a hyperechogenic halo.	0.4375979083723742
However, due to perifocal edema, the real coagulation area was smaller than detected by ultrasound.	0.5137436149547459
Macroscopically and microscopically, the coagulation zones showed well-demarcated borders of the coagulation lesions, and the surrounding tissue appeared vital.	0.7509001881610734
The reparative reaction after irradiation was early fibrosis.	0.23245133227313522
In the course of 4 weeks, the surrounding scar capsule, containing fibrocytes, biliary ductules and collagen fibers enlarged.	0.5318642977997909
As a result, the coagulation necrosis became more and more fragmented between collagen fibers and was largely resorbed.	0.5630643981629946
The absence of complications in our animal experiments suggest that the technique of thermo-controlled laser light application is safe and useful in therapy for metastases that are not resectable.	0.6003807693556363
Attachment theory, originally developed by John Bowlby, becomes increasingly relevant in the field of psychotherapy (research).	0.4648018595449423
This review starts with a definition of central concepts and hypotheses of this theory and summarizes results regarding the development as well as correlates of attachment, mainly from research in developmental psychology.	0.4974408208939449
Related to adults, attachment theory has to be reconceptualized which is done in another part of this paper.	0.5855413888625428
Finally, some common methods for the assessment of adult attachment are described which play an important role in clinical studies (these will be the content of the part 2 of this review).	0.7428832871360876
Inflammation-mediated osteopenia is an animal model for bone mass reduction following chronic inflammation.	0.4565563620189954
We found a reduction of calcitriol serum concentrations during the inflammatory process, in addition cytokines are increased.	0.754072063767873
Treatment of the animals with calcitriol is able to prevent bone mass reduction and to preserve bone formation.	0.5313274235593773
Anxiolysis with drugs and psychoprophylaxis are both recognised methods of preoperative preparation.	0.29378220238259617
The beneficial effects of anxiolytics, however, appear to be difficult to prove.	0.49266363570157595
In this study a comparison was made of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol levels.	0.7533927887146747
In group I 19 children recieved only psychological treatment, while in group II 21 children received 0.2 mg/kg midazolam orally.	0.7088132138474555
Measuring points were directly before medication, 30 min afterward, and at induction of anaesthesia.	0.716548932635809
During the observation period the patients (5-10 years old) remained calm.	0.7921769766215471
At the beginning of the study the parameters of all patients were within a normal range; 30 min after premedication the HR and BP were significantly higher in group I than in group II.	0.9170542718758894
In contrast to group I, epinephrine levels in group II were lower at the beginning of anaesthesia than before premedication.	0.639997246082174
In both groups, norepinephrine levels were the same at induction of anaesthesia as before premedication.	0.48243685245363527
Cortisol decreased only in patients who received midazolam.	0.8325894421517925
HR, BP, as well as humoral stress parameters indicate that midazolam in a dose of 0.2 mg/kg orally is sufficient to reduce preoperative stress in children.	0.5348244011702499
A case of isolated right ventricular myocardial tuberculoma with pericardial effusions is presented.	0.49927184972737265
The diagnosis of myocardial tuberculoma was initially suggested by echocardiography and later by magnetic resonance imaging.	0.5424449676113712
The diagnosis of cardiac tuberculosis was confirmed by demonstration of tubercle bacilli in the pericardial fluid.	0.4223778066012091
This is a very rare condition which is usually diagnosed only by necropsy.	0.7005222420226419
Myocardial tuberculoma should figure on the list of intraparietal masses visualized at echocardiography.	0.27879113687655505
The incidence of hepatitis A infections has decreased due to improved hygienic conditions in Germany.	0.5026569644423973
However, hepatitis A is one of the most important diseases imported to the country.	0.6989286129365492
Currently, more than the half of all registered hepatitis A infections are acquired in foreign countries.	0.632150446064591
According to the decreased morbidity over the past few decades most younger people (age below 50 years) are not immunized and, subsequently, this age group is at higher risk during exposure in foreign countries.	0.7651396629911521
Therefore, a hepatitis A vaccination is recommended before travelling in countries with a higher incidence of hepatitis A (Southern Europe, Africa, South America, and Asia).	0.6081316903429613
Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are a group of Gram-positive organism, which have in common a fermentative metabolism with lactic acid as the major end-product.	0.7180716614231587
Except for bifidobacteria, the LAB are phylogenetically closely related.	0.46975754867681574
They directly contribute to human well-being as they are the most important germs in the production process of fermented foods which constitute one fourth of our diet.	0.5904939318722913
They are, furthermore, an essential component of the mucosal flora and especially of the intestinal flora.	0.7240462716455034
The genus Streptococcus contains highly pathogenic species which can be clearly differentiated from the useful germs.	0.4594838974982501
The intestinal flora contains such species of the genus Lactobacillus that are also important in food fermentation and species which are strongly adapted to the intestines and therefore, can be found exclusively in this ecological niche.	0.5300809788880094
A special status characterises bifidobacteria and enterococci.	0.32478791877558194
The former are located in a separate phylogenetic branch and also occur virtually exclusively in the intestines.	0.47415196464683146
Enterococci are rather ubiquitous, participate in indigenous food fermentations, are found in the mucosal flora and are counted as opportunistic pathogens.	0.48573245813800797
To influence the intestinal flora and to achieve health promoting effects LAB are isolated from the intestinal flora, grown and employed either as pharmaceutical preparations or additions to food (usually fermented milk).	0.4619543235840925
These bacteria are termed "probiotics".	0.2980795777330747
The exposition of consumers to high numbers of germs belonging to one or a few species needs an evaluation of their safety for human health.	0.4357749868728233
In this process the traditional experience with the safe nature of the species can serve as an important criterion.	0.6482743570008227
In front of this background, LAB in probiotics can be considered to be especially safe, nevertheless some restrictions have to be made.	0.588319531550495
Generally, the germs used should not contain genes encoding transmissible resistance to antibiotics.	0.44201554004053134
In addition they should not produce biogenic amines (e.g.	0.23945942179894578
histamine, tyrosine or phenylethylamine) and should not degrade mucine.	0.5246600158978414
The assessment may also include the following: absence of a potential for deconjugation of bile salts, induction of platelet aggregation and binding to fibrinogen and fibronectine.	0.47472555996243765
These examinations may be required as certain LAB have been identified in clinical isolates.	0.5729385967571939
The isolates were, however, obtained in the most majority of cases from debilitated patients.	0.5310841196919336
The germs were components of the body flora as well as of the environment, organisms deliberately employed in food fermentations or probiotics have never been isolated.	0.5975099112260186
Dural sinus thrombosis is not uncommon.	0.28716215814999163
Due to the nonspecific symptomatology, as well as the manifold etiology, clinical diagnosis may be difficult.	0.7265640324890059
In these cases imaging procedures are frequently crucial in deciding how to proceed and how to treat.	0.522609761823919
The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of helical CT in the detection of dural sinus thrombosis.	0.6218241203667185
In 20 patients with clinically suspected thrombosis CT angiography was performed.	0.658682148505603
In 6 patients dural sinus thrombosis was diagnosed.	0.48336569647322036
In order to acquire also arterial vessels, a short delay of about 22 s after the onset of the application of contrast medium was selected.	0.7036753908397045
By this method we found an occlusion of the MCA in two patients with clinically suspected sinus thrombosis.	0.789183488495169
In all patients the transverse slices and the multiplanar reconstructions showed filling defects or an "empty delta" sign.	0.5226727341976205
With irregular outlines the thrombus could be depicted over the complete course of the sinus.	0.5347328765153252
The MIP reconstructions were particularly helpful in the evaluation of the vessel anatomy and the pathological collateral venous drainage.	0.5424967752263834
In three patients MR angiograms were available for comparison.	0.5354665084021526
The smaller veins, such as the v. vermis inferior, were less clearly depicted than in CT angiography.	0.5919177407763158
CT angiography is a fast and reliable method to exclude or verify a sinus thrombosis.	0.5042644847392611
It can be performed immediately after non-enhanced CT.	0.6565327472601112
According to our present experience CT angiography is sufficient for the diagnosis of a sinus thrombosis.	0.7508123876389031
Coronary angiography ist considered to be the most important component in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.	0.7776346964627023
Only the lumen may be visualized using contrast radiography of the coronary arteries, however.	0.5755841157835366
With intravascular ultrasound, on the other hand, pathological changes in the vascular wall can be recorded.	0.638483312103542
Despite typical symptoms, an angiographical image of the coronary arteries is sometimes unable to show unambiguous stenotic lesions of the coronary arteries.	0.6290513183472777
In such cases, intravascular ultrasound provides a new complementary diagnostic tool for detecting even early forms of arteriosclerosis or angiographically underestimated coronary findings.	0.4797302082601795
Two cases are used to illustrate this.	0.6206735788199724
In those, angiographic visualization of the coronary arteries was unable to produce an unambiguous finding despite typical clinical symptoms, yet intravascular ultrasound could detect considerable arteriosclerotic wall changes.	0.4952412288778671
Purpose: The pontine micturition center plays a central role in regulating the micturition reflex, but the precise neural mechanisms are unclear.	0.6434452249105956
The cerebral cortex is involved in coordinating micturition but there is little knowledge on specific evolutionary higher brain regions.	0.4586056265258027
The present study aimed to investigate whether cortical activation during micturition can be demonstrated by EEG power spectra patterns and to explore whether specific cortical regions involved in the interaction of inhibition and release during the micturition reflex can be discerned.	0.5539515623883349
We also aimed to test whether intravesical electrostimulation (IVES) therapy in patients with micturition disorders has an effect on patterns of cortical activity.	0.527693230805619
Background: Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy represents a severe, potential vision-threatening disease process that requires close interdisciplinary cooperation for treatment.	0.43149215672804847
In general, any therapy has been dis-cussed controversially in the literature.	0.4473276045710671
Based upon experiences with spinal cord trauma, high-dose steroid therapy is recommended initially to minimize secondary consequences following orbital trauma.	0.573286942019343
The usefulness of surgical decompression of the optic nerve has been confirmed in several studies but is still not recommended in principle.	0.6812685123973373
In recent years there has been an increasing incidence of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) in otherwise healthy adults.	0.6681893916805072
It is characterized by fever, rash, hypotension and early shock with consecutive organ failure and a mortality rate of about 30 %.	0.5536159525324791
This paper describes the history of two patients with severe streptococcal TSLS.	0.7367346429379803
Various aspects of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapy are discussed.	0.9059960730437013
Only early, aggressive and repeated surgical debridement can reduce the bacterial load and decrease circulating exotoxins and thereby, in combination with antibiotic therapy, decrease the high mortality of this entity.	0.6395007666898702
Purpose: To test, whether axial, coronal and sagittal MIP and MPR reconstructions of diagnostic quality can be obtained from 1-mm collimation MSCT data of the chest for the evaluation of thoracic anatomy and pathology.	0.6883739296602105
The risk to health posed by a sedentary lifestyle is a problem of our times.	0.43947748781515994
In contrast to the previous assumption that only fairly high-intensity sporting exercise undertaken over a minimum period of 20 min produces health-related benefits, recent studies have shown that even everyday activitites (climbing stairs, brisk walking and cycling) can have a benedicial effects on health, particularly in those who take little exercise.	0.6057679512847198
So now the recommendation is: exercise of moderate intensity lasting 30 min at least 5 times a week, corresponding to an energy consumption of about 150 kacl/day or 1000 kcal/week.	0.40255334958000977
The results of experimental studies on sport and arthritis and sport and osteoporosis point to the advisability of taking up or maintaining an active sporting lifestyle.	0.4747786226336524
