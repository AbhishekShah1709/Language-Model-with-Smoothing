So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully.	0.7908405121553852
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents.	0.9403009662342371
The Treaty of Amsterdam, Mr President, has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe.	1.3570956435438133
Mr President, I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution, which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible.	1.3394790543313468
In any case, this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon.	0.9990398083226547
I think that, under the present rules of the Treaties, the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation.	1.4737626154985695
On the contrary, we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms, in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposals are worthy of note.	1.3001362596885808
We must use dialogue at every political level, including of course dialogue with the national parliaments.	1.244021658976957
That way, we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms.	1.387833108829962
Parliament' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that, with the Union' s institutional changes, we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union.	1.45277398483483
They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone.	0.89642091517992
The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive.	0.9362859744358485
It may be easy to come up with solutions, but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term.	1.1278913501465413
I will mention two point that may create tension.	0.8960574960197303
One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries.	0.9988752781560135
Europe is not, nor can it become a classic federal state.	1.1308659421239071
The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union, which is a union of states and peoples.	1.1473798311700683
The other area of conflict is more difficult.	0.779969939727489
Owing to the imminent increase in membership, the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective.	1.435606149236401
This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly.	1.0778248568751085
By its very nature, however, the European Union is, and will remain, a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution.	1.3882626782447611
Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist.	0.630842461747331
Of course they do, but they are not unlimited.	1.3044696379325635
If the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness, then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer.	1.312485599557895
I am, however, optimistic.	1.2194104828043595
Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened.	1.1523072463009476
The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union.	1.2498686381818804
It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union, which will, however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned.	1.4030638080948825
The Commission' s former president, Jacques Delors, has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation.	1.4618707757232887
He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions, for the sake of clarity.	1.3902565924196586
The Commission' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines.	1.5250038974405897
Last November, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe: the onion skin model.	1.106976098221454
In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility.	1.44218211963227
Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party.	1.177748843489587
My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand.	1.1950612204086126
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions.	1.295042162595231
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about.	1.2579451796929346
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament.	1.0690137421427948
A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly.	0.9049780377888523
If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality, six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants, you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales, which is a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom.	1.2325472752668465
Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in this House at the moment; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen.	1.6311754825000422
Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700, bring in 26% more population over time, and then adopt the Commission' s, I think ill-considered, proposition, that there should be a European list of candidates.	1.341579403349939
What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here?	1.2630784616587747
It will become totally invisible!	0.7042559856098999
Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones.	1.2875153921280769
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view.	0.8043585605787733
Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times.	1.7040296881087886
This time, however, it is true.	1.3147962952896644
We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement.	1.653654670812756
The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not.	1.2980029111169855
Will we enlarge with or without deep reform?	0.6275086447899537
That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method.	1.5252957472905904
It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place.	1.4343649139838197
That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand.	1.3083597059460172
The Council must realise that, if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further.	1.5211458598345
The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion.	1.21743179293783
We want an Intergovernmental Conference, but not this one.	1.3501414865724988
Must there be an IGC?	0.6791059371677179
Of course there must, but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference.	1.2622784290705404
The agenda must go much further. We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic.	1.4064249688335169
Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes, more - its ability to take the initiative.	1.4714563033589527
We must clearly set firm objectives.	0.7064407338213823
The functionalist approach is over, for better or for worse.	1.185932531519754
The functionalist approach has brought us to this point.	0.6939566665672442
Have we achieved results?	0.49028025598046127
Yes, but the point is to make a qualitative leap and, speaking in political terms, this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment.	1.3434471752239108
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi.	1.3370368645315567
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency.	1.3787337159066881
As far as we are concerned, after producing the opinion expected from the Commission, according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated.	1.3129936498525747
We know, I know myself, that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us.	1.4882065779137468
I would just like to make a few comments, after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups.	1.413007275116111
Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda.	1.3693642245488507
I understand this anxiety, this fear that the agenda may be too limited, and yet I feel, as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki, that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate.	1.6422245710659644
Indeed, it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate, which the Commission framed for its own opinion, but using all the terms thereof, plus everything between the lines.	1.4824838737479642
We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label.	1.3391141637210258
I do not like the term 'leftovers' any more than Richard Corbett does.	1.1345488023494854
It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects, and difficult, so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth.	1.2838997410351063
As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects, even though I do consider them as priorities, and consider that they must be dealt with now.	1.4157038566299887
They are the first but they are not the only subjects, Mr Seguro, that the conference must deal with.	1.630414011435416
We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference, if the Portuguese Presidency firstly, and then the French Presidency, so wish, in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement.	1.550575786991001
We are ready for it, whether it is a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which work has started, the CFSP and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations, or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work: reorganisation of the Treaties.	1.405509298870291
I have heard many comments on the Commission' s opinion, which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth, with specific indications of new draft articles, but no one has said that we were going beyond the Helsinki mandate.	1.5475439063193097
This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate, by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers.	1.1918478333471798
As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceedings, I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me, on the basis of our shared experience, in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok, are going to be working.	1.3968099262787232
Of course, the final trade-offs will be made, as in any institutional negotiations, and I think this is no bad thing, at Council level, especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government, who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands.	1.5638282915146426
Let me point out, in passing, that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is also a Council member, and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role, alongside the Heads of State and Government, particularly during the final period.	1.4118761299368423
However, these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared.	1.3911883533195755
This preparatory work, this fine-tuning, must not be omitted, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful, and that it will not just be limited to technical details.	1.5757823713486108
I think that all of us, the personal representatives of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, your two representatives, and myself, as a representative of the Commission, will be going into matters in detail, but it will be afterwards, at a different level, one in which we will also be participating, that the last trade-offs must be made.	1.6336035974194631
Throughout this conference, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important, but the quality of what they will be saying.	1.404481620239221
And once again I should like to point out in this House, in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament, prior to Amsterdam, the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations.	1.415780297225628
I am sure that the situation will be just the same and, as far as I am concerned, in my current position, I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations.	1.5097967824830227
I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be.	1.7698441720145501
We now await, therefore, with great interest, ladies and gentlemen of the House, your next opinion, in which you will specify Parliament' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations.	1.4749247653444328
It is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negotiations, the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other, alongside the Council members, explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continually, every day, what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as European institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest.	1.410770162141565
In the coming months, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation, on good terms, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok, in order to reconcile our points of view, if need be.	1.3310120670461605
Quite probably, our points of view and our positions will not always be the same. There will probably be differences of opinion, that would be only normal.	1.5408971440666832
The important thing is that we are consistent, and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner.	1.3583810726341186
Our concern and our ambition, therefore, on a large number of subjects, is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully.	1.323883494399756
This will not be a matter of chance, since, let me repeat, I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union.	1.3926523777410649
Finally, I should like to make three additional comments, quite briefly, Mr President.	1.369458500696136
Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate.	1.5475347406242743
Such dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important.	1.330549755593919
I have said, furthermore, that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments.	1.2554536806341623
Tomorrow, I shall be in London.	1.2878969807906389
In a fortnight' s time, I shall be in Berlin.	1.3067380472865406
In three weeks' time, I shall be in Paris, and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another.	1.4383144425692806
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive, and I should like to thank you for taking it.	1.353914999973764
My second brief comment is to thank the Portuguese Presidency, particularly Mr Seixas da Costa, for his proactive approach.	1.4175345389315248
Indeed, the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own: the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency.	1.2557496394734164
It will have to initiate these negotiations.	0.8112391153602434
We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency, in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000.	1.2742701197475244
Not only that a conclusion can be reached, but that a successful conclusion can be reached, which is not necessarily the same thing.	1.2834424507726934
Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully.	1.2400841789853478
The handover will have been made, but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made, by yourself, Mr President, and by the Portuguese Presidency, are going to be extremely important, as is the nature of this handover.	1.5881845500189975
It is all the work which is going to be carried out together, under your guidance particularly, in the course of these few months, which is extremely important.	1.448599304800559
We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion, and indeed great expectations thereof. Portugal is a small country, but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions.	1.4209786083095757
After having heard Prime Minister Guterres, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself, I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations.	1.3700606488217297
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months.	1.1608052536620632
Finally, let me repeat, we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations.	1.3856091910680322
These are difficult subjects, subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain.	1.0067345457683357
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament, Ministers, Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens, to public debate.	1.2683658837557115
As far as the Commission is concerned, it will, ladies and gentlemen, be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate.	1.4036985378182492
Cross-border services	0.28247065951097705
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	0.5807876034932212
A5-0007/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services (COM(1999)3 - C4-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD));	0.7951882987021385
A5-0012/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a Council directive extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to third-country nationals established in the Community (COM(1999)3 - C4-0096/1999 - 1999/0013(CNS)).	0.8450628556021005
- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today, but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do.	1.117487293884358
I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative, and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today.	1.3996922240298941
It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis.	1.3261759057484057
The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees, I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst.	1.4650828284059945
These have, in fact, clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits.	1.2766670186703
However, the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue.	1.3646489633931456
Furthermore, not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice' s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement, and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services; barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for the smaller companies.	1.389018602452688
The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services.	1.1084566482532898
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here.	1.3562440150103583
Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises.	0.9552597912979912
It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement.	1.1562180865652003
All provisions, i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights, should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services.	1.2518761065497632
I, together with the European Parliament' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view, as expressed in the report produced by the Council' s Legal Service, is inappropriate.	1.4337990907446612
Consequently, I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned.	1.3676926698205953
I also believe that Parliament' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission' s proposal.	1.2479935751842754
Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the Council, and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense.	1.2029463338510205
When it comes to acceptance by the Council, I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible, even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals.	1.5124406525629115
I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis.	1.3147686596520913
Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments, one of the essential differences is that, in place of a "service provision card plus notification for each individual contract" system, provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract.	1.2294888377146722
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms.	0.8758838245052972
However, in order to compensate for this, all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued, and as the Commission' s proposal would have it, more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued.	1.3405742728724483
An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection, not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter.	1.4670063257546007
This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident.	1.0932532208443286
Likewise, the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued, namely under the terms of an opposition procedure.	1.2735114641605927
What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States, rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States.	1.4039344121738604
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs.	1.0537616301488353
I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months, and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting.	1.3372130498932358
However, we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months.	1.3039873911126645
When it comes to self-employed persons, in addition to the amendments already described, we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent, and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment.	1.4359031578997932
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	1.085660006217154
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee' s amendments, which they adopted unanimously.	1.317144342057036
I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions.	1.0109252386283263
I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament' s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted; whether or not one should use the number or date alone, or both, and how extensively to quote from them.	1.3047971359556463
Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report.	0.9273353277533409
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons.	1.2848791286032601
I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology, i.e. the correct way to quote.	1.2050933675707656
This would make our rapporteur' s life considerably easier in the future.	1.0760532047812743
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio' s reports.	1.0664426962599323
Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously, and I would like to stand by this outcome, which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions.	1.2527101817494477
On a final note, I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in compiling these reports, which were far from easy to produce.	1.2914411361949942
I would like to single Mr Wieland out for special mention, for he has the dubious honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is customary in the drawing up of this report, contributing excellent and constructive ideas; and this without being in a position to receive the plaudits awarded a rapporteur.	1.2676145827455878
That is why he deserves special mention!	1.2269430414932854
.	-0.0
(NL) Mr President, I am pleased I have been given the opportunity to make a few introductory remarks at the end of rapporteur Mrs Berger' s speech, after which I will, of course, listen with all due attention to the next speakers. If you allow me, Mr President, I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate.	1.3612891240448373
May I say how the Commission welcomes the European Parliament' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third-country employees, the topic of the debate.	1.291879698831961
I am extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge.	1.2681682628306734
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	0.8521199000663369
The Commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards.	1.0971375082868795
If the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more, or all, Member States, the procedure would be more flexible still.	1.4363508019779216
The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card.	0.9183357955265036
However, I do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a Member State.	1.1774136252011094
The Commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice.	1.0323585836232356
An efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market.	1.0367426010928225
It seems over the top to us for other Member States to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards.	1.2474666045613179
Indeed, it should be possible for a third-country subject who has legal status in a Member State to be admitted to other Member States too.	1.3044970069338864
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification.	1.1171856791176062
Neither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three months after the card has expired.	1.039649949222906
Following completion of the service, it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided.	1.3317264516572875
That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio' s Amendment No 22 in both respects.	1.2650839282823696
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the Commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal.	1.2611720601562955
These are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments.	0.8469390467157943
I hope that, at the end of the debate, when all the speakers have contributed, I will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments.	1.4590645033108682
Mr President, tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as well as the amended version.	1.21775904770735
I propose to confine my comments to two areas.	0.8564442498184581
Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve, that is achieve in the real sense.	1.367884341057627
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account.	1.6416704954480514
My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment.	0.9053917193318541
Then there are the interests of the Member States, which, being on the receiving end, may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario.	1.3294847970679322
If we are going to abide by the one extreme, that is the interests of the Member States, then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high.	1.3286989774140965
There is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card.	1.2113481143853715
If I were to go to the other extreme, as few hurdles as possible that is, then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive.	1.3563347112447877
I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place, but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high, in reality no one would apply for the card. Alternatively, I might have no directive at all.	1.5203110768749393
Neither outcome would be satisfactory.	0.5868940929457312
Perhaps this is also why, as is rumoured to be the case, the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well.	1.5648331213513134
We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other, that of finding the easiest possible solution.	1.6051874300450595
We want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis-à-vis the business world, but once these have been overcome, implementation is as easy as it possibly could be.	1.1313870578766276
Therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States.	0.8736943839818507
If a company in France says that it has an employee who has to work in Denmark on a permanent basis, and only in Denmark, then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark.	1.448943766382332
Accordingly, the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance.	1.2215755323761963
In return for this, however, we want early notification obligations to be discontinued, rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them, and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his/her posting.	1.414824115694415
Consequently, I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	1.0793973377677772
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission.	0.9065458654676335
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution.	1.1578863287082306
If a particular Member State was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country, then this particular Member State would be able to revoke this card, as it were, for the reasons cited in this directive, which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution.	1.2585119909213767
Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter.	0.9640758883232804
Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers.	1.116637938445604
We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty, some of them very old, which are still referred to as EC.	1.3974498015829773
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law.	1.1166571903035607
However, before the elections we - the Council, the Commission, Parliament, the press, unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens.	1.5338701510808201
We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU.	0.9483507199381427
They have now got to grips with "EU" .	0.9855530950197622
We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver "EC service provision card" and not "EU service provision card" .	1.1756012165143437
It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in, this is the one that counts in their eyes.	1.6798575221653547
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction.	1.125397973938108
Mr President it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so I shall be very brief indeed.	1.1826028530443504
One of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism.	1.088031649203898
This directive is, of course, not in itself directly about that.	1.3623439113602214
It is about attending to the needs of the internal market, creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed.	1.0664558926383751
That is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger.	1.0257993862696186
We welcome that, and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision, we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law.	1.4433611922824128
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally, which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive, which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council.	1.3107605021583233
Nevertheless, I have tabled an amendment.	1.1613470340573702
Mrs Berger, in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6, you mention legal security.	1.4344508867649426
The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit, since all that does is create legal insecurity.	1.0989089702104269
You rightly raise the concern, also expressed by Mr Wieland, at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire, but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit.	1.2694190224841961
If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date, it must end on that date.	1.2379722936523487
Legal security requires this.	0.44009416268815527
On the other hand, with regard to point d of Amendment No 10, which refers to the first directive, you suggest that, for reasons of public security or public order regulations, a Member State may reject the validity of the card.	1.386677693131198
There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive.	0.9886031337240553
It makes no sense for any worker within the Schengen area, since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State, and the second Member State would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory.	1.1922290725167544
It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity.	0.9820440747267021
In the case of a non-Schengen state, in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22, that possibility is contemplated, and is perfectly expressed, and I believe this provides greater legal security.	1.4837248878763247
The discretional power of the State, which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10, seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report.	1.1434794526703411
I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully, and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result.	1.3551328914091443
On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks.	1.1659262575493252
However, in the case of the United Kingdom, we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable.	1.6252924325959675
Partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom.	1.3703422082227967
Under the arrangements contained in the Treaties, the United Kingdom retains its border controls.	1.1696520060438722
Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation, third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described, will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State, thereby by-passing UK border controls.	1.1106853917827786
If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements, that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process.	1.5321077778703778
For that reason, we shall vote against both these proposals.	1.1350418666303508
Mr President, Commissioner, first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner.	1.2293750632309663
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services.	1.1530377367680085
The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises.	1.1832420769066487
The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr Wieland on this - are essential, for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts.	1.3294992170743936
Why do I think we need the directive so much?	1.3833378976411095
Three reasons and they are as follows: on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU, in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market.	1.2492758940496314
Therefore, whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions, I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible.	1.6642028441828918
My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission. Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations?	1.2488960676006482
How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view, as this will have important implications, notably for the accession negotiations and for our country, which shares common borders with so many applicant countries?	1.3798063438644492
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, did not apply to them.	1.2651186621083175
Indeed, they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided.	1.3383127878181265
There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory.	0.8029160383931635
I assume that, although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known, their number will most definitely not be low.	1.2855913999668365
So, up to now, their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation.	1.3700130174470262
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card.	1.3396390379874294
It seems important, in this respect, to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner, namely within five days of a simple declaration' s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided; and that, also to prevent misuse, this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended.	1.432619725673876
I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner.	1.20016105212909
Having also studied the amendments submitted, I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow.	1.4022078945302858
May I, to finish off, thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having, in that way, added an important degree of meaning to her report?	1.3454782483070808
I think that, with this report, we are, once again, one step closer to the realisation of the internal market.	1.342865484450469
Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail.	1.0780138746293724
In the course of my speech, I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regarding the remark he has just made.	1.2558765740943583
Regarding the first proposal on third-country employees, the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 22.	1.0267445704832512
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too, provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established.	1.2654173490935112
The Commission also agrees with Amendment No 11, except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months, as I explained just now.	1.1911891702822028
We also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as, as a result of this, the card' s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States.	1.169382808389746
In terms of comitology, Amendments Nos 14 and 21 also apply in part, insofar as the rights of Parliament are concerned.	1.0561247085915364
I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three-month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned.	1.299397269598302
In this respect, the Commission supports Amendment No 22, as I have already mentioned.	1.423722178749614
The other amendments are unacceptable.	0.8638685226173225
Personally, I am rather in favour of the term "EU service provision card" which is proposed in Amendment No 1, but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this.	1.5391488490721592
As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96/71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force, no change is necessary.	1.1818637413445963
Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued.	1.1193104081348018
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States.	0.9309745297192522
Amendment No 19 is also unacceptable, given my thoughts on Amendment No 10.	1.1365451441985726
The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal.	1.380768320288638
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable.	1.2160209026503799
As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term "self-employed" is concerned, the Commission will, as I have already remarked, provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged.	1.3283360060059555
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood' s remark.	0.725410024214061
He referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States, and this includes the United Kingdom, are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders.	1.3703229410665079
This applies, as already stated, to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium, where it was recently of relevance.	1.488727696122562
With regard to the remark made by Mr Karas, I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country.	1.287247259398394
The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU countries.	1.3797307253662021
The question is, furthermore, one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way.	1.2216519012686409
In my opinion, this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate.	1.3093897990296384
On behalf of the Commission, I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point.	1.243588496327789
I will keep myself free in this connection.	0.8047646134169779
Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and, in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Berger.	1.459572560888534
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.	0.8964582779371926
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.	0.5768350812905695
Court of First Instance	0.00940721208534589
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report, which, on reading it, gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council' s draft decision.	1.3114368137786916
However, this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results, such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency' s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation, composition and competences of the Community Courts.	1.3426901326021792
For this reason, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho.	1.0444867208739408
Mr President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if, in the future, we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales, and if, in the future, the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon.	1.5773064173483877
Today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market, and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests.	1.5393375053718672
Behind these principles, Mr President, lies the justice system.	1.1691918956510807
However, justice delayed is justice denied, and we must reflect on this notion.	1.634582388543926
The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information.	0.9712085685496503
For this reason, the draft reform, which has been drawn up by the rapporteur, Vice-President Marinho, is to be welcomed.	1.3080140371769333
It is true that it is a stopgap solution, but we must rely on stopgap solutions because, at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference.	1.543389108004235
We have to offer solutions which, while provisional, help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice.	1.4100077262221262
I would like to make two observations during this intervention, which stem from the report itself, given this Parliament' s obligation, in accordance with the Treaty, to produce a very succinct report, which does not go into depth.	1.4998129948968295
These are two of Vice-President Marinho' s ideas and, I believe, they are seconded by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	1.1457559992448816
The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance, and that they should be given one more référendaire.	1.4880098702191966
The second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated.	1.2227463858461964
At the moment, the Court of First Instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated.	1.2512139848925354
According to the Treaty, one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language.	1.2036840667355666
Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference, let us consider just two points.	1.0937421553805047
The first concerns this Parliament.	0.8437119290724794
I believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice, even in the appointment of judges.	1.2521729576817486
Above all, we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice, hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations, in other words, its resources.	1.2756045613461222
We wish to see its competences extended, especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible options, certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens.	1.4452302167689373
And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days.	1.3288905710805763
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report.	1.079860595406119
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency.	1.1769738026571452
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice.	0.7563079640224872
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT.	1.0885271456607637
The decision could have huge implications for our local economy.	0.8217205056612665
Secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age.	0.9896248539903657
These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe' s system of justice. Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy.	0.9708819891018107
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect, but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court.	1.5100572829333139
Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references.	1.0881633777267468
This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff, rather of the Court' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union.	1.3990455096685985
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative, but Europe is a legal construction, its courts are central to its proper functioning.	1.4098490891334587
In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system.	1.0941479332511646
Otherwise we will all, as elected representatives, be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice.	1.3183577541305835
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report.	1.0059675017108227
I also fully endorse his findings, in which, in particular, he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service.	1.2812464101507364
In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve.	1.3263913379647032
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here.	1.3184323450519044
For example, I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance, if applicable, and making this a final competence, in those spheres where benches of the Court, which resemble courts, pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law.	1.410591296065411
I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level.	1.272769291902448
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions.	1.3951205901890116
We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind.	1.0975727309147518
Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance.	1.0875421972777468
In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance.	1.3693499207118933
On a final note, I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law.	0.9553313852595119
As things stand, OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases.	1.0176414326761731
It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court.	1.2256654281951418
The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance.	0.9795990834729453
That would be another way of spurring the reform process on.	0.9611337576458362
Mr President, I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work.	1.0900481817292442
The European Union is a system based on law.	1.2945783064599923
It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law.	1.165296653061914
Furthermore, if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them, what happens, as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, is that justice delayed becomes, as we know, justice denied.	1.5097364415259336
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem.	1.229735810076248
However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC,	1.830007254682547
In my own country, mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges.	0.8285244571227349
There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system.	1.2295322899958048
The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo/French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union' s disputes resolution procedures.	1.1986260459324805
This has been compounded, so some who advise me believe, by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government.	1.3061962484923164
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible.	0.8647740628656724
This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable.	1.166167994172516
What is happening in France, Mr President, appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties.	1.2494127852615884
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings.	1.504068388070925
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this.	0.9174766676926067
Mr President, on behalf of Commission President, Mr Prodi, I would like to respond as follows.	1.347214581089672
The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The purport of this request is, on the one hand, to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance, such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and, on the other hand, to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance.	1.3510093782420145
May I add that, on behalf of the Commission, I listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas.	1.2845531292459464
The unease is justified.	0.43202385105138685
It has been said more than once: justice delayed is justice denied.	1.0101353388088774
The Commission sympathises with these considerations.	0.5862616421062512
In the light of this sympathy, I would like to continue my response as follows.	1.232340796004281
As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines.	1.5347831368485154
Consequently, the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades.	1.3894029372576098
The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First Instance to increase its number of judges, but at the moment, the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned.	1.2758621883805858
In other words, once this study is complete, the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible.	1.313459016602182
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.4314254166720252
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo	0.5167455501742584
The next item is the report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/00 - 1999/0240(CNS)).	0.7448822058445981
I have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes.	1.1340048006448231
I propose that we start the debate immediately.	0.8339353885286999
He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives.	0.9546531234476027
I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bourlanges, in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.	1.269212696380061
Mr President, this is an important and urgent matter, and Parliament is complying with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly, because today, you must realise, men and women are dying in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero, these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid.	1.496804900698505
An urgent request has been referred to us, and we approve it.	1.2551720897183818
We have been asked for EUR 35 million.	0.9636039172471915
We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring, once the decision has been taken, that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible.	1.312424433575826
We are talking about macrofinancial aid.	0.6642683927333201
There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration.	0.9661714489365235
This is not our opinion.	1.3984165842328558
Our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region.	1.1215432155022382
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state.	1.227291339658916
The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments, the donors have made commitments and, obviously, we are the only ones actually paying.	1.5553925496179748
The other parties are not paying.	0.6583848668979042
We wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regarding requests for financial aid.	1.0913631089778655
We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this.	1.4668209595691446
We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors.	1.1115116589175131
This is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but, quite the contrary, to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors.	1.3099564336804566
From that point of view, the proposed facility is a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest.	1.2031082264484874
Finally, we have three questions for the Commission in this regard. Firstly, we need the Commission to give us, on a regular basis, the list and the amounts that other donors contribute.	1.7692549007062643
When we come to pay, we want to know what the others are paying.	1.2257351237554213
Secondly, we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation.	1.1543889975773693
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet, according to our information, no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date.	1.1310900150040424
This is serious, since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo.	1.0531729377749464
Finally, and this follows on from what I have just said, we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis, monthly, regarding progress on payments made.	1.5481369672320984
We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments.	0.7062448000012886
It is not firm commitments that we need, just plain commitments would suffice, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, more especially, what has not been paid.	1.6225007741381448
Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment.	0.8390699407192224
Mr President, if we are going to discuss Kosovo today, as we have done many times before, then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo, or of whether in fact anything has been done at all.	1.5386834987776663
What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality, and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate.	1.2770397075649271
As of 9 February, there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council, which will comprise representatives of the political parties, the minorities and civil society, and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament.	1.487222090329372
This is a positive move and we welcome it, but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare, for elections are planned for the autumn.	1.5036709993583195
No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result.	1.1773977003005833
No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis UNMIK.	1.149031302961793
In other words, there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either.	1.165716292783732
Of all people, it is the Albanians, who are now being integrated into the transitional council, who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them.	1.4884960839392065
In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work, urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs, Albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the Roma of course - in this country, so that at some point in the near future, on the road to coexistence, it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place.	1.3932431722530678
I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about.	1.3839256519581389
Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors.	0.8984007835540696
That is excellent news!	0.5246191066586665
There too, people are being encouraged to pay their taxes, for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources.	1.3439792295439148
It should also be noted that of the 19 departments, 4 already have administrative leadership, which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto.	1.3116243119563311
There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law. We have 130 judges and public prosecutors, who have now been sworn in, and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice, with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little, and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions.	1.482357178687994
Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UCK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country.	1.2961346671373148
I believe that is a good thing	1.381463930577304
I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way.	1.315025807080433
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything.	0.7023102953099747
It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar, but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr Kouchner' s outstanding bills.	1.2049069580836316
One could do so once or twice, but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well, for there is a very large hole, as yet unfilled, that we are unable to fill.	1.4766211257727757
We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it.	1.3905979015508685
Mr President, I would like to offer a few explanations.	1.1240895357403982
In a debate, there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said.	1.531651281428389
However, I would like to concentrate on two points.	1.1363350809096402
Firstly, I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo.	1.3620737076330218
I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press is true, and that figures do not lie.	1.4009905260119024
Let us make this clear, however much some people may not wish to believe it.	1.3290495950593677
The Union has decided to assist with a further EUR 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo, on the basis of an IMF report which estimates that a further EUR 115 million is needed for that reconstruction.	1.1430436780577122
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I am in complete agreement with her when she says that the Commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments.	1.4018241612681277
I would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter, in any circumstances, the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin.	1.5500822291957441
This calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached, with great difficulty, with the Council in December, according to which, when the Commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction, the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary.	1.5188415228017094
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach.	1.1104012078733385
I would like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that Commissioner Solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme, with the corresponding report, requested by Parliament, so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up, as we have been promised.	1.4066342877257625
Lastly, I would like to insist that, although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now, we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough, and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo, which is so badly needed.	1.5000669032710345
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse my late arrival, but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the pity.	1.4204158524636623
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million, and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need.	1.0342780528538424
The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there.	1.0868402135471875
However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process.	1.3975141794435848
Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents.	1.4170997384970783
Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions.	0.930110677172838
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future.	1.0952584415928952
It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this.	1.2483380766373093
However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here.	1.3016346431834807
One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims.	1.217741293569946
In other words, we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres.	1.3041427219461335
Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there, we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into.	1.4852342456385592
This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations.	1.372477678939823
It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected.	1.3229177776287644
This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there.	1.247612190363611
This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence.	1.2642231140732512
We have so many coordinators, who, in turn, are responsible to so many employers, that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators.	1.3224958811762022
Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there.	1.3571120538273742
I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this, but if the European Union is doing the most work out there, then it should also be given the leadership, and bring coherence to the situation, so that we can be of real assistance to the people.	1.490661457470506
It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground!	1.1747716637393235
Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of March - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline, that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented, and there is a steady stream of new press conferences, this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe!	1.4866858278636212
Accordingly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative, so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month. Rather, we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country, and I hope that in the process, you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months.	1.4217292912676038
Mr President, when the Alliance intervened in Kosovo its objective was to re-establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return, with respect for their own heritage and their own culture.	1.3098311286169055
If the Alliance is still active in that region, it is with the same objective.	1.2178430320965077
The day before yesterday I was pleased to hear an interview given by the KFOR commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in Kosovo were starting to be, particularly as regards security, crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level.	1.1473481944355726
Those representing Europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective, and I am thinking in particular of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, are on the verge of despondency precisely because, since matters are improving, there is less talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent.	1.1908738243277115
We must work to ensure that, in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally, the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords.	1.4834814238045533
It is true that economic aid is, in this respect, certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level.	1.2223037499303466
Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we, the Members of the European Parliament, must fulfil our own obligations in this regard, while ensuring, of course, that we are not the only ones to do so.	1.3510216948944203
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for his report.	1.0930789135052557
If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on.	1.2580594749620282
The Council' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret.	1.131554052947566
The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should, and must, provide help swiftly, however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random.	1.3609482078958965
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point, which clearly emphasises that it is only possible, and permissible, to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public, communal and other authorities and institutions, which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK.	1.231915879913447
Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations, in particular Pillar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place.	1.5613109126086717
What is to be done with this money?	1.1200538161778646
I would like to highlight the issue of human rights.	1.00887558562119
The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today?	1.40583635132621
We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit.	1.0127943790166516
Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians.	1.3934115804191787
I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life.	1.2011699934646962
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated.	0.7112101693513553
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo.	1.3906961132272757
There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again.	1.1568686418300034
It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo.	1.118256382866284
It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo.	1.3883919815282268
What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together.	1.2851336243828364
We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough.	1.1883353994898431
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights.	1.5302204594957998
All of this needs to happen, and quickly too.	1.3071967031797984
If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise.	1.0113030030027184
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available.	1.6272135193617834
Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary.	1.5126352325581292
. (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue.	1.3783594010897529
This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned.	1.1120097628569325
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight' s debate.	1.0608884920931303
Firstly, although much progress has been made, and we could mention customs administration, bank administration or tax administration, it is true that we must continue to move forward.	1.4643438182384927
However, in moving forward, what should we be financing?	1.6991494296314453
This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement.	1.2884730933050135
In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds, for example, Amendments Nos 3 and 5.	1.150053342435228
In our view, however, in both respects, greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which, on the ground, is more aware of the reality than we are.	1.3745561269651057
We believe that to prejudge, at the moment, where resources should be directed, would create more practical difficulties.	1.3983701702935831
In short, we should put our faith in those parties who, in these areas, are better equipped than us to make certain decisions.	1.466715203371842
The second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges, but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors.	1.4087036535964321
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate?	0.9846864629606077
Some of the amendments in your report pose this question.	1.1821408375101294
For example, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4.	0.865480709187016
I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue, that this is not the fundamental problem, although we recognise it totally.	1.5470786401902015
The fundamental problem is that, at the moment, the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the High Level Steering Group, but it is also true that they have no legal status. This is simply a political commitment.	1.4206085491697107
That is the reason why, while accepting its spirit, we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources.	1.4413585598710161
I would say the same about Amendment No 2, which we would also accept with a slight modification, since the idea seems to us to be basically correct.	1.47447739443747
Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature.	1.0439521882072575
On this specific point, we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction.	1.194338575723524
We have already spoken to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision, establishing this element of conditionality.	1.4153920740917694
With regard to the second contribution, what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors.	1.3167623024152377
In other words, we should not establish conditionality, or we believe that it is more effective not to establish conditionality from the start, but, nevertheless, we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage.	1.560330334484753
In this way, we would have no problem in acting immediately. We would not create problems for the Kosovar people, but, on the other hand, we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing.	1.5572874026397132
A third problem has been raised by Mrs Dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes.	1.0643424441378935
I would remind you that these projects are multiannual.	0.965211395692345
The programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account.	1.049059994580878
Lastly, I would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us.	1.191056232152209
On the one hand, we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and, in this respect, I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament' s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in Kosovo.	1.3692909865257779
The Commission can commit itself to regularly informing Parliament of the invitations to tender which are published.	0.9779205680487691
We also wish to see these publicised on the Internet, so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point.	1.2518600154476667
A second point which I would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance.	1.2205602371081072
In this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed, on a confidential basis, if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality, on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance.	1.4608883545042297
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that, with the final decision of the Council, we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in Kosovo by different parties, so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see.	1.3331857161725753
Mr President, I am pleased to see the convergence of viewpoints there is between Parliament, particularly the Committee on Budgets, and the Commission, and we can assure you that, for our part, we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the performance of its duties.	1.6164767663849369
I do, however, have one small concern, when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets.	1.3929174152940413
There was a clear agreement, good or bad I will not say, but there was a contract. There was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7, i.e. on the idea of linking the mobilisation, the implementation, of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment.	1.5531203782100695
But, if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira says correctly, then this undertaking was only a tentative one.	1.3050086441869915
Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement.	1.6671563612971185
Can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on Budgets, yes or no? Or are you going to drop this proviso, thus breaking the undertaking made to us?	1.1715209379364737
No, Mr Bourlanges, I think it is a substantive problem.	1.6702936265643442
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted.	1.1576443653472588
What I proposed to you, and what I still say, is that the Commission will make a statement, in the Council Decision, something like this:	1.8121419547791195
The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors.	1.0474792652333722
With this, we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed.	1.5390035951216405
I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche.	1.4921146485652579
I agree, absolutely. We shall do so.	1.4153933310741855
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.4314254166720252
ALTENER	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD))	0.6411152583607225
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council.	1.3381650887682197
The project has been long and problematic.	0.76503304591715
In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources.	1.0723771744778525
Although there is much that is good about the new directive, it is nonetheless not without its defects.	1.3197100223763936
One example is the use of peat.	0.7834059042315099
Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels.	0.9596893501980704
If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned.	1.3728119740570628
It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal.	1.2834319840612434
The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union' s dependence on imported energy.	1.0992791964205548
Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU' s next round of enlargement.	1.0454733799744211
Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries, whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy.	0.9717139997895462
The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate.	0.9218506120847213
We are all concerned about the environment and our children' s future.	1.2773800389467664
The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased, but it has to be done in a rational manner.	1.196270070489001
We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come.	0.9927892310637899
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy.	1.0960110785464956
Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme.	1.375722611741681
Firstly, however, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the truly excellent work he has done on this report.	1.1651078904341576
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan.	1.2681036422683485
For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee.	1.2027807022147934
However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout.	1.4603353327746476
Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point, that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community.	1.1293985315005788
This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear.	1.578029902337789
However, we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed.	1.5410129045699923
For in the course of the next few years, the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double, accounting for at least 12% of energy consumption.	1.2632445587862775
This is the European Union' s declared aim.	1.4058675681187662
That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role.	1.3172981922383655
In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples.	1.2596262394008564
To my mind though, what is particularly important about the ALTENER II programme are the new actions for relieving market saturation by renewable energies and those for implementing, supporting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan.	1.2419805081634165
We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission' s services on a breakthrough campaign, which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy.	1.4686185057393222
It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors.	1.0887641381923674
It is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it.	1.1127611992051625
The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion.	0.8447876955563444
75%-80% of this is to come from private sources, and this will be supplemented by public funds from the Member States and from the regions.	1.4191076677832601
In this respect, the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment, and help us to realise our ambition, in the interests of environmental protection, the economy and creating new jobs.	1.4035609165196836
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mr Langen for his excellent work in this important matter.	1.1019514747458823
The conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the Altener programme as put forward by the Conciliation Committee is, after all the difficult phases it has been through, at least satisfactory.	1.4402532893388156
Most of Parliament' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive.	1.2087109234769107
The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy.	0.9531277149470425
There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets, however.	1.2172881936116473
The appropriations are needed for pilot projects, research, information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy.	1.0137170688520167
The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States.	1.0609428198798982
This programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy.	1.0583069988175717
However, in the future, the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market.	1.3581738529131406
Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment.	1.044912560063214
The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up.	0.9828080352191191
Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness.	0.8354333432144531
Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy.	1.021916984934717
We should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment.	0.9680772326003206
May I also venture to raise the matter of peat?	1.0178141194805344
Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources.	0.8458788616719032
However, it is important, at least in Finland, as a sustainably used, slowly renewable energy source.	1.4792359518664078
I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables.	1.2588957775710645
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are pleased with the agreement which has been found, and their thanks go to all those who negotiated so well in favour of an amendment which the Greens were almost the authors of.	1.2165020355023104
It is interesting for me, as a new Member of Parliament, to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation.	1.265135510095186
This is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale.	1.2828033001991894
In contrast with that, I see the amounts allocated for renewable energies, which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion.	1.4162792631924237
Seeing the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been capable of acquiring in this field, because they were the first ones to develop that area, gives one food for thought, I feel, and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies.	1.2828394935999967
One last word regarding the programme. I think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there.	1.4161757321258641
In order to ensure that at least 50% of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources, it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term.	1.261687443910849
Mr President, may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work.	1.0320917430783816
The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future.	1.0543979128248642
For this reason, I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises.	1.1201547366010078
The internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone.	0.9985817352501534
In this regard, it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit.	1.082037948082583
It is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables.	1.004219956300756
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend £125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector.	1.1303391460387975
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives.	0.9597658247252534
As the final text rightly states, actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities.	1.1353309283982214
I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster, a significant portion of which falls within Ireland' s only Objective I region.	1.2175382808332964
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions, including the energy sector.	1.1700427908273305
In short, we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol, while at the same time promoting growth in our economies.	1.1172556594171401
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States.	0.9924030470073691
Mr President, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, as our rapporteur mentioned, we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme.	1.496026169251137
Mr Langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the Council was initially FF 74 million, whereas the Commission proposed 81.1 million, a figure which the European Parliament supported.	1.4555091803163664
An initial conciliation meeting was not successful, because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.9 million.	1.168782426544087
We could not agree with a proposal like this, which challenged the authority of the European Parliament.	1.4662155215103525
A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million.	0.9999877325928902
In spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal, personally, once again I deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the Council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply, job creation and environmental protection, challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to.	1.3345825228535457
In fact, renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives.	1.155052253783256
However, in spite of the reservations I am expressing on the paucity of the financial allocation, I personally support the compromise, by virtue of the programme' s content, to which the European Parliament made an active contribution as, following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, this sector become subject to codecision.	1.4612853384004416
It is practically certain that, with the raft of proposed measures and actions, it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12% renewable energy share by 2010, doubling the current rate, as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available.	1.2519206231311568
This programme, together with the SAVE II programme, integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy, establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence.	1.0243030338739352
And, in conclusion, Mr President, let me also insist upon the fact that, in addition to the measures proposed, there are also legislative measures and, most especially, adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives.	1.347629602279354
And I shall end, of course, by congratulating Mr Langen, our rapporteur, on his work, as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee.	1.625566638108623
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the ALTENER II programme in the Conciliation Committee and associate myself with the comments of the different speakers and, of course, point out that this agreement will allow the ALTENER programme to be incorporated soon into the framework energy programme.	1.3078199689254955
All of this will provide greater coordination, transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes, into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme, which we will be discussing soon.	1.380756865383401
I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality, and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary.	1.4324916489628379
Obviously, there have been arguments, we had to go to conciliation, as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reminded us a moment ago, since at the first meeting no result was achieved, and there had to be a second meeting, despite the fact that the figures were not excessive.	1.5746569326322868
However, I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement, which, like all agreements, is perhaps not perfect, but which, I believe, allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing.	1.5362161742350948
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, to thank the speakers and, of course, to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure, who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result.	1.3506492096670455
I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council.	1.0094151197744554
SAVE	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD)).	0.7218429770876613
Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round, which is not always the case.	1.2622887275032062
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form.	1.2446283457717897
The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there.	1.312854144755126
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading.	1.1785482733869774
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments, including a re-instatement of the Commission' s original budget.	1.2528112791160115
The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable.	1.2088477215763318
During the procedure, agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise, implement, complement and assess the Community measures.	0.9888225494165349
Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and, very importantly, the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency.	1.1785900574596124
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress.	1.5826564569667485
The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council' s very meagre opening offer.	1.378187546180275
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount.	1.2278609491365455
We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under.	1.3181490511871643
This was an important consideration for us.	0.8852287704700833
I would like to say however that it is, and has always been, a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real.	1.532583459382259
Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States.	0.7026440484321713
We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme.	1.1947185423961761
If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level, this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action, including Community actions, on energy saving.	1.4099599905766431
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region.	1.0790421327936859
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard.	1.6532606868188522
SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy.	1.0639455657043206
It focuses on non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted.	1.3329505796705075
Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings.	1.269869473302504
We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business, saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical.	1.1856568661054416
It is something that we can all support.	1.1501128301643364
I have to say, like motherhood, although we all support it, sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving.	1.2549922477137943
We could do rather more, considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports.	1.2222927869553466
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see.	1.326296569728404
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change.	1.2176115350292445
If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do.	1.2723836006106695
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process.	1.0952785731016033
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal, since she has contributed, in collaboration with the other Members, to the achievement of a very reasonable final result, which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and, of course, on what, from a budgetary point of view, the Council had initially accepted.	1.5550158528151643
As Mrs Ahern has explained very well, the budgets of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme, are basically symbolic budgets, since the burden is shouldered by the countries, the States of the Union, the regions or even, in some cases, the local authorities.	1.4475044252021658
However, despite the fact that the volume is relatively small, it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action, which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments. This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources, greater safety in our energy supplies and, in the case of SAVE, to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy, thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set.	1.4410398720856852
Furthermore, behind these programmes, that is to say, the SAVE programme, which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings, and the Altener programme, which concerns renewable energy, there lies an extremely important technological challenge, which, from an economic point of view, may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole.	1.4648476091834095
With regard to the parliamentary procedure, I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken, especially the rapporteur, because the majority of Parliament' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council, in this case practically all of them, although with some modifications. I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved.	1.4026626480892865
This improvement has been achieved with fresh funds, as we said at the time, and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament' s prerogatives and competences.	1.3954851332846194
From the point of view of the Commission, in this interinstitutional game, I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it.	1.5547698540434163
I would like once again to thank all the speakers, and also, especially, the Vice-President, Mr Provan, for his magnificent work throughout this debate, particularly during the conciliation procedure, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry and, also, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Ahern, and all the Members who have participated in this work.	1.5232959054316033
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.4314254166720252
CULTURE 2000	-0.0
The next item is the report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ('Culture 2000') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD)).	0.723124250946292
Madam President, I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate.	1.447019514842776
Unfortunately, there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it.	1.2966976872447862
We have the feeling, and are in fact convinced, that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht.	1.5614503824147463
For no one is very keen to spend money on culture.	0.9536511875749034
Sadly that is the case and we must face facts.	1.5955502341211854
I would like to thank the rapporteur, who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task, in conjunction with the Commissioner of course.	1.2693433897745503
We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect.	1.2801004046499767
One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind, where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision.	1.1412403352401201
What kind of horse-trading system is this?	0.6850908631402
Certainly not a fair one! There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side, begging for a little more money for culture.	1.3877095947865505
It is downright scandalous what goes on!	0.5607791416653869
It is an awful sort of horse-trading, based on unequal positions!	1.0170613411990554
Nevertheless, we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to.	1.4542335842152863
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us.	1.021185110862975
We will support small and medium-sized events, not the large ones, and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access.	1.431780296613654
I believe that the fact that Culture and, fittingly, Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner' s remit, will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes, which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the European Union.	1.3158517447501572
If one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied, but then only a tiny bit.	1.1894982925877382
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money.	1.1870712315156307
Madam President, I agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and I must add that, during the conciliation procedure, I was personally a little disappointed with the Council.	1.3478586532966832
On the one hand, it continued to refuse to accept the term "European cultural policy" or other similar terms, even undervaluing the terms of the Treaty, and it defines "Culture 2000" simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more.	1.3215541394093002
On the other hand, it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this Parliament, which were minimal anyway.	1.4217749583831831
Incidentally, this last point would be unfair to fourteen Members of the Council, since it was just one, the Netherlands, which was responsible for that intransigence.	1.61784748682051
It has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council.	0.8484188559313225
This demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution.	0.9943395747876831
However, Madam President, these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow, and which the Socialists will vote in favour of, will put in place one of the European Union' s most important programmes.	1.7075710847316048
By taking action in the field of culture, we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul, especially given the fact that the sub-programmes which make up "Culture 2000" are superb.	1.2935664760060726
In recent years, these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the youngest and most dynamic citizens of the European Union.	1.0067108916117296
Lastly, I would like to mention the profoundly human impression I have formed of the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura: his knowledge, his sense of balance, his intellectual qualities, make him, in my opinion, the best possible rapporteur this report could have had.	1.2573053088659751
Congratulations!	-0.0
Finally, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Reding, Vice-President Imbeni and Mr Gargani, chairman of the Committee on Culture, for the firm and intelligent position which, each within his own role, they have maintained during the entire conciliation process.	1.202272715873872
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would like to start by thanking Mr Graça Moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this Culture 2000 programme.	1.1516945348633754
It has been said before, and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions, that culture is, of course, extremely important as an area unto itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for furthering the European idea.	1.3801717677282057
It is also of great importance to citizens.	1.521473574441758
We should, above all, not lose sight of this. The impetus given to the European idea by this programme is having an enormous impact, especially on small linguistic areas such as the Netherlands which not only has national potential, but is also relying on support from the programme, mainly from a language point of view.	1.3972260666219751
Today, we have arrived at the end of a long road.	1.1611073204921154
I would nonetheless like, as others have done, to touch upon the procedure, which is unclear and, above all, unwanted.	1.3480693434160775
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand.	0.8367332500448544
They are like a snake biting its own tail.	0.7538223730823326
There is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand: anything is open for discussion, as long as the budget stays fixed.	1.1961993420621095
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage.	1.4088065969517347
The result is 30% growth, so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result.	1.4766317546809635
Of course, it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes.	1.5339388971452226
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot.	1.2471253897134695
Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas.	1.001096566252701
A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds, and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind.	1.207908415329075
Fortunately, I am on the Committee on Regional Policy.	1.7155357593231884
So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention.	0.8825047322125279
I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because, if it happens to be cancelled, then surely this does not benefit the citizen.	1.5369707217583573
I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect.	0.98668550137266
However, I do think that it is necessary, as he always states too, that, in the next IGC, changes will be made to codecision, when unanimity will no longer be necessary.	1.7875349076491682
We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made: no more mega-projects, room for cultural networks, and sufficient attention to promoting reading, translating and translation companies.	1.1902455587340453
This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000.	1.1992887700127721
All that remains for me to say is: time to get down to business.	0.9848817115155692
Madam President, all that I wanted to say has been covered by those fellow Members who spoke before me and I think there is unanimity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture.	1.574559433137519
I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart.	1.4518237942190988
Not because our delegation, our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding' s attitude - I think that, given the framework she was operating in, her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council.	1.41775516813775
It is shameful!	0.34353144694827287
That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union!	1.135908287326613
When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, pioneering activities in the arts, writers, to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign, something opposed, contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro, not just enlargement, nor geostrategic expedients, but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end.	1.3174436882432368
	-0.0
	-0.0
So long as we continue to have unanimity, so long as yesterday the Dutch Government was able to impose those EUR 167 million as an ultimatum and so long as a government with Mr Haider will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue, we will never progress.	1.238832814088513
That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the European Parliament' s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments.	1.2692305140391904
Madam President, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur' s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Mr Gargani, for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also, considerably difficult.	1.3746391161917797
Of course, we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes, but everyone hoped that the Culture programme could help to promote, for example, the unique features of each cultural sector, even - and I could say especially - of the unique features of less well-known sectors.	1.4581564900942194
We hope that this, at the least, will come about during the evaluation process.	1.5659518109674757
We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action, among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social, as well as economic, development of a people.	1.3155370742660246
And a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its roots, highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known.	0.9891991776861732
As for the important educational task which the European Union must carry out as regards culture, one of the programme' s most obvious limitations is the level of funding - we have heard this several times - which censures the fact that the Council at least - certainly not the Commissioner - is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action: the document which prioritises the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this.	1.4586188663355806
The overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens: this is why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme, albeit with a scarcity of funds, can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal.	1.3314623325671489
Madam President, I will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that I support the adoption of Culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, who took over from our former colleague Nana Mouskouri.	1.3262763871267682
Both of them have done a first-class job.	1.067713625686173
Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day, culture may not seem that important, but it is; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important.	1.452085718327861
Why do I say that culture is important?	1.0188270651178246
Well in simple economic terms, Europe' s culture adds to genuine prosperity.	0.8337613450506021
Where would Europe' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture?	0.9391761804576573
But, more importantly than that, cultural activities are what make mankind civilised.	1.3350356460000932
Culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs; and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy.	1.1651778286197145
Cultural diversity is important, and it is under threat.	0.999175591015648
However, it is not under threat from Europe.	1.4428292167712156
Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat, for example, from Portugal, from Germany, from Finland, for heaven' s sake.	1.4639464045997843
We do drink port wine, and we do like German beer, and we even use Finnish saunas, but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat.	1.4040443282785364
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola, eating hamburgers, wearing baseball caps, watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time.	0.933763684339939
Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe' s culture, but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can.	1.4426758891819698
That is what Culture 2000 is about.	0.94069373530514
So, I say to the Council of Ministers: Keep this programme genuinely under review.	1.4819777051259435
Are we doing enough?	0.7098817057101605
And, I say to Madame Reding, thank you for the support and the help you have given so far, keep up the good work, we are on your side.	1.5156956153299965
Madam President, I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Graa Moura, and Commissioner Reding, for their contribution to the creation of this programme.	1.4077531502239953
The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council.	1.108268500063968
The outcome can be considered reasonable, when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the Council.	1.4097747087970696
We have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture.	1.3669922741509433
It is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the Council.	1.1359501429132555
The framework programme on culture is replacing the present Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael programmes.	0.8534228338036134
When implementation of the programme begins, I hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full. I believe and hope that, despite the assault on us all of the new technology, literature will maintain its status.	1.412398291888172
We need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial.	1.0325823695725747
Literature likewise plays an important part in the way it transmits our cultural heritage, increases mutual familiarity and preserves linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongues.	1.0401249888261515
In this connection, I am very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon, the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries.	1.379113271168556
I hope that this conference will also encourage the Commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society.	1.3039047493502833
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, somehow or other, today' s agenda has come full circle.	1.1769949835758666
We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values, about tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive approach to the enlargement process, transparency and respect for each other.	1.3313853226584749
Youth, education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values, for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes.	1.2423328645871798
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union' s goals.	1.3854780579490669
Cultural activity creates identity.	0.44134755032973255
Cultural activity is an expression of individuality, of an individual' s own personality; it builds relationships and communicates.	1.2451592115269219
We want a colourful Europe.	0.8912811532634805
We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity.	0.9388589460662745
We want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences.	0.9093180784412419
That is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget, the allocation of funds that is, into the different types of measure.	1.2188862559796134
That is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures, because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals; because we want to see thousands of flowers bloom.	1.2118385943989134
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say.	1.106997980449508
There is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle, codecision procedure, and Conciliation Committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen, and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European consciousness.	1.4704540770841017
Madam President, as we have heard, all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council.	1.3243493934695223
It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure, for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests.	1.4735765966909788
In this way, the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order.	1.2891907942226395
The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years, and now, at long last, the European Parliament can give the go-ahead.	1.351465371195234
The Council could not be moved, not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael finished.	1.0240763272059072
A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap.	0.7281736976320198
This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union' s cultural policy activities once again.	1.0780916780947198
The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support.	0.8157781042560392
Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered.	0.9212508924527145
The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro!	1.173185565835236
And so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004.	0.7853552806469294
That is the same as a single, medium-sized, German opera house' s expenditure over the same period, when here in Europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years!	1.1323449505319645
There is a blatant discrepancy here!	1.0529031854824056
And so we are going to have to be content, albeit very grudgingly, with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content.	1.2961622259538061
Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out.	0.804862437555562
We can only hope that it will, after all, be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day.	1.4109105555935686
Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good, not harm!	1.578226096025117
Cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity, far more so than any transport directive, however important it might be.	1.4304996979152702
Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance, and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions.	1.2792087200085986
What, may I ask, is the Council afraid of?	1.3624441701364687
Madam President, whoever has the honour, like myself, to chair the Committee on Culture, cannot fail to agree with the comments from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur, and Commissioner Reding, with whom he worked and who, even during the conciliation process, had difficult moments and opposed the Council - you have heard this said by everyone.	1.496719752323306
I have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at European organisational level has been firmly asserted, but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the European States will make.	1.3920408344694366
I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because, in the end, we did not manage to adopt a review clause.	1.153097831431587
However, Mrs Reding was certainly receptive and farsighted, and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years, and therefore to change the situation.	1.5708600546751872
The cultural programmes launched in years past - Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael - are being replaced by a single programme, Culture 2000, where - and I must stress this here very forcefully - the rapporteur censures a position which should give the European Parliament cause for reflection - as someone said this afternoon - but which still underlines the huge importance of being part of a vast community where cultural interpretation is a democratic factor.	1.554022441824559
This is not rhetoric, but the new embodiment of a modern liberalism which unites the European States and constitutes a turning point for the European Parliament and the Commission.	1.3860970443780474
We agree with this approach and despite the lack of funds, this evening' s result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for Europe, which will then give rise to an economic factor and a growth factor; culture then, and an institutional aspect, the basis for structuring a vast community, a prerequisite for economic growth, and not the complete opposite, as Europe, in its cultural habits, has perhaps been used to viewing things in the past.	1.5308657865127004
Man and culture are priorities, and culture can result in economic growth.	1.1422279764616858
Let us contemplate this result, derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy.	0.889025880425122
Madam President, may I first thank Mr Graça Moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry.	1.1091370170973116
It seems to me when entering the conciliation process for Culture 2000, having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate.	1.169146265781002
Again, because these conciliations are not entirely straight forward, we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our Community.	1.2911606690784765
The fundamental question, it seems to me, that faces this Parliament, the Commission and the Council is: What is Europe?	1.5384375967773172
What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries?	1.033787062249273
Europe is its people, its history and now its collectivity; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this: I will wager that when we ask the question - 'What is Europe?' - we answer it by saying, 'It is our art, it is our literature and it is our heritage.'	1.5862336608776215
That is what Culture 2000 represents.	0.8577716850525265
It represents the possibility of sustaining a European identity in the twenty-first century, an identity which eschews the echoes of division, of war, of poverty, of opportunity, of poverty dans la realité.	1.3052238353918084
And more than this - and this is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive, that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require.	1.3007241350087455
It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.	1.1775109162594033
My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver.	1.1489617339510352
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of a long road.	1.275997253307704
Following the conciliation stage, our institutions can now formally adopt the new 'Culture 2000' framework programme.	1.1754572232649378
We shall thus, in the course of the next five years, have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear, well-structured and, I am sure, successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector.	1.3119585097911177
It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this 'happy ending' in this House, and I thank you for it.	1.240771510520813
I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process.	1.3594353384812439
I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, particularly to its rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, its chairman, Mr Gargani, the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups, the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr Imbeni.	1.5008056681130677
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution.	0.788695884556446
Throughout the negotiations, they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time.	1.170489042372035
We now have a framework programme, the first of its type for the cultural sector, and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive, but also more thorough and detailed manner.	1.5188364524494586
I would like to express my delight, with you, at this pleasing outcome. In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions, these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani has just said, that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment.	1.3977575763187131
It stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision, it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme, and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the Community financial perspectives.	1.5959640732659293
If need be, the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision, and this should be achieved by 30 June 2002.	1.3871793366330651
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a formal commitment, not just words on paper.	1.4693528477702342
All this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area, within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features, in all their diversity, but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them.	1.402419018614807
It is thanks, too, to Parliament' s action, preferring a number of small-scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale.	1.1968909855141372
This is going to lead us to make 'Culture 2000' the programme of the citizen.	1.1292760950568044
The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and pray for. I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality.	1.395581794831194
I know that you, as Members of Parliament, in your own regions and countries, are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers, as one Member of Parliament said, go to make a vast multicoloured carpet.	1.6944631102260648
I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens, both in personal as well as in social and economic terms, but a right which it is our job to assert, and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union.	1.4269751127448054
This is what our European 'Culture 2000' programme offers.	1.1727907162813025
It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States.	0.9186421936445776
Such policies are necessary, and I would like to see them developed further.	1.360346034794835
It simply adds to them, complements them, building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries.	0.9453968641976062
I feel therefore that extending and enriching European citizens' participation in culture is a crucial task, one which justifies the efforts we make to achieve it, and this is the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union.	1.3395164876758505
A number of Members of Parliament have quite rightly raised this point. If the Union is purely an economic union, then it is a stillborn project.	1.6289118456177467
However, if it is a union of culture, civilisation and participation, then it becomes a living thing.	1.403823502966403
This is the foundation, ladies and gentlemen, which I intend to develop, and I shall take the following five areas into special consideration: firstly, providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserves in our programme.	1.367293222959302
Secondly, encouraging exchanges, mobility and training in the cultural sector.	1.0795642624885822
Thirdly, promoting cooperation between cultural operators.	1.06497009837038
Fourthly, increasing audiences for culture, with particular emphasis on attracting young people to culture and, fifthly, protecting the common cultural heritage on the European scale as well as the history of the peoples of Europe, and making them better known.	1.3885067874246788
The new programme will, I am sure, in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency, efficiency and balance, prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures.	1.3698663230175372
Madam President, I reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its support and for, once again, having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the Union.	1.2384276354827763
I am certain that it will not be disappointed, having given us its support, and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed, as things progress, of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens, which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union.	1.5579402266082376
Thank you, Commissioner.	0.6737777542510281
I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again.	1.594955821817109
The debate is closed.	0.029002480165961946
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	0.4314254166720252
(The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.)	0.7100784159456167
End-of-life vehicles	0.06620548174863751
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles [8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	0.8959568751641409
Mr President, nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe.	1.1326162637404225
Even though they can no longer be driven, these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders; and not just intra-Community borders, but also those outside the Union.	1.2710130864165625
It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed.	1.32509506524985
We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking.	1.3459610215043225
We therefore have a number of amendments.	1.065553457122703
I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective.	1.3401969847941164
I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive.	1.2355103219737789
Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included, as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a European directive in this area.	1.3447130111848424
I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either.	1.1240136929511388
I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas.	0.7830565009534436
This is my main concern in this matter.	0.9728701197354729
In my opinion, the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe.	1.0825485367594414
This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars.	1.3043858846227179
This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc.	0.8512225284646417
An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts.	1.2429633298848708
What should we do with the shredded products?	0.9111827136348138
We should not overlook the fact that, although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery, they are by no means the only point.	1.3958411273324143
Do not forget that, in the case of cars, 80% of environmental impact comes through driving, 1% through recovery and 19% through construction.	1.1853241207287588
Quotas are not, therefore, the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility, just one of many.	1.3102603460920055
Of course we need to aim high, but quotas must not become an end in themselves.	1.3990787881099243
We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars.	1.0579692847646285
I am far keener to see us move away from today's car, weighing 1,400 kg and driving an average of 200,000 km, to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just 1,000 kg.	1.0384086211236654
This would at least mean 400 kg times 200,000 km less transportation.	0.7893366842957376
This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which, if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol, is the important factor.	1.3256731732314302
We therefore consider that, in future, vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quotas.	1.0239514944886914
It should not be for each Member State, but for you and your staff, Commissioner, to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles (and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles) should receive preferential treatment.	1.3581745774200247
We think they should.	0.5082035590706647
May I say something about costs.	0.927198077661096
Some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer.	1.4036959527743738
However, this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycling.	1.2748492879018791
I can only warn you against consenting to this.	0.9117905513100716
There are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car.	0.8352098670953146
The money from this pool, system, or however you want to picture it, would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder.	1.3232471278153715
This too is a particular desire of my group.	1.0468747763380069
Our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage, namely that we won't be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive is adopted.	1.2341166690774314
The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions, which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly.	1.4230529604219437
This is why I propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer.	1.0614797142321621
As for a ban on certain materials: of course we need one!	1.3877674420985795
A car has dangerous components which we must ban long-term.	1.016824994036268
This means that we need a pressure instrument.	1.162850488857232
The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives.	1.3135911433742007
There are a number of sound amendments.	0.5630261115005553
This Parliament has been given more authority, so let us use it!	1.4243642755941108
Let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive.	0.8451811717905515
A directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this House.	1.1254010702245294
I ask for your support.	0.7815352462468835
Mr President, I almost feel like saying, "Phew" , now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which has given us so much work, and which has clearly also given a great deal of work to the rapporteur, Mr Florenz.	1.5732914604208865
I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which, today, can only be removed at local authority expense, i.e. the taxpayers' expense.	1.2625262796570937
The principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied.	0.5941201837956714
Vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by Community legislation, in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end-of-life vehicles.	1.2576194239345109
The only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future.	1.311795249245119
It has not, however, been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle.	1.384375758459832
On the other hand, we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find (a) materials that are easier to recycle and (b) to set up recycling industries.	1.2336797381986278
I should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycling, reuse and incineration, as far as the new particularly light materials are concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emissions.	1.1299900873290367
This is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end-of-life vehicles and the former directives, including the one on auto-oil, which we voted on a few years ago.	1.478278845639652
We must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on having the wisdom, in order to make things perfectly clear, to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage.	1.2061796867915262
In conclusion, let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still clutter our forests, lakes and gardens.	1.1221511767842656
Once again, the principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied. The taxpayer is still footing the bill.	1.017866629532645
Mr President, Commissioner, reading the leaflets which have been distributed in recent weeks, one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in Europe.	1.4020170576817925
Neither is correct.	0.3465661310016468
We simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive.	1.2042879245049518
It means ecological progress for Europe, and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion.	1.107170574833953
All the same, there is one point on which we are in conflict.	1.6138845147242824
In the grand scheme of the directive, it is perhaps a minor point, but nevertheless a disputed one.	1.2871431999083132
It concerns the issue of recycling costs.	0.9420651100563789
Here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year's debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs.	1.0911240621380063
Last February in this House we unambiguously decided (and we Social Democrats are sticking to this) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question!	1.1712660943369038
So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of?	0.9325603718756094
For us this is straightforward: in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars.	1.2123126823997568
And what about vehicles which are already on the road?	0.9654249251010476
Let us look at an example. Rover in Great Britain, if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars, would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs, whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts, as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it.	1.2292993713513578
Such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in Europe.	0.9393112919609572
Consequently, for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs.	1.3589731355070358
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds.	1.1688115387561624
However, I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in Europe, so that these jobs can be secured in the future.	1.2912535412294817
I am in favour of stringent environmental requirements, as you know from the auto-oil programme and the debate on exhaust emissions, but I believe that they should be the same for everyone!	1.372222111702623
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we need this directive.	1.3376409775552243
Firstly, because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives.	1.560699302671931
Secondly, because it can promote recycling, which is important.	1.8703184999586948
Thirdly, because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals.	1.473883987651219
This is also an important point.	1.1880412449649145
The directive affords a European framework, also to Member States who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these.	1.308778683115591
So, first of all, we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level. This will, of course, provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of.	1.260048700691177
Secondly, we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position.	1.1355202704717433
As from 2006, therefore, all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners.	1.1165318361185774
Needless to say, this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way.	1.242015767325165
Is this too much of a burden?	0.8626774724905338
There is, however, one thing we should not overlook.	1.4994953288938742
The directive applies to complete cars, that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing.	1.1380431563633169
According to the experts, few of these complete cars are of no value.	0.8999894438146119
After all, recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making.	1.2265261550436726
Quite the reverse, in fact. At present, there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them, and a decent one at that.	1.3406661105995648
This directive encourages the whole of this sector.	1.0847092822118523
It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses.	0.9811353062356858
Since, in this case, transport costs are high, a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised, because transporting an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity.	1.4985717498454956
I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles, and I think we ought to add this provision to it.	1.4606160700286723
I think, therefore, that vintage cars ought to be exempt.	1.0109007613544352
Also, it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer.	1.3100811908772931
That is a basic principle which we must uphold.	1.2441866342697456
As manufacturers are responsible for the design, they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase.	1.3846223309575334
We must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer, as stipulated in the common position.	1.216780085114737
I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things.	1.0098934352225224
I think we need to retain it.	1.178532854338513
This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence.	1.478240419773369
After all, we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about, and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position.	1.456714956116001
In my opinion, we should not jeopardise that common position, because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons.	1.3652385219622463
I would ask you to support this common position.	0.8495546471710327
Our group will, at any rate, do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including, for example, the way in which the costs are to be distributed.	1.4268608922347157
Mr President, we need to take an important decision today.	1.448390166510586
Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer' s liability, that is to say that cars, once they have reached the end of their lives, are the responsibility of the car manufacturer?	1.3984811198629425
No, according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. 38: car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50/50.	0.9330851952197357
It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50/50 compromise is included that this does not work.	0.9694481350990961
Packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment.	1.0247324345582998
Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45.	1.2667088028000963
The common position stipulates 2006.	1.0050974715238759
According to the group of the Greens, this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations.	1.3027901114330147
I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists.	1.1469283281032363
If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply.	1.2246752109955052
The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic.	0.9407510126341232
This is ultimately cheaper, also for the consumer.	1.1489092833077081
For twenty years, the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener.	1.2816534638545758
